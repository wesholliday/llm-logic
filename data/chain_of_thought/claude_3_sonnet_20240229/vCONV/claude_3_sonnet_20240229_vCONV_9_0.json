            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nStep 1: Identify the premise and conclusion.\nPremise: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\nConclusion: If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nStep 2: Represent the premise and conclusion using logical symbols.\nLet P = \"Lisa bought the red shirt\"\nLet Q = \"Mark bought the blue shirt\"\n\nPremise: P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\nConclusion: Q \u2192 P (If Q, then P)\n\nStep 3: Analyze the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the form:\nP \u2192 Q\n\u2234 Q \u2192 P\n\nThis form of argument is known as the \"converse\" and is not logically valid. The converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true, even if the original conditional statement is true.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the validity of the argument.\nThe argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise. The premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt, but it does not guarantee that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no"
