However, it does not imply the converse (q \u2192 p), which is the conclusion.\n\nIn other words, the fact that the vampire being awake implies the mummy being awake does not necessarily mean that the mummy being awake implies the vampire being awake.\n\nTo illustrate with an example:\nIf it's raining (p), then the ground is wet (q). This does not mean that if the ground is wet (q), then it must be raining (p), as there could be other reasons for the ground being wet.\n\nAnswer: no"
