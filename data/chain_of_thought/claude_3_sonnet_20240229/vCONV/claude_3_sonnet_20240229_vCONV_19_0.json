However, it does not provide any information about the truth value of the antecedent (P) when the consequent (Q) is true.\n\nIn other words, the premise \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" does not guarantee that \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football\" is true. It is possible that Jen watched basketball for some other reason, and Tom did not watch football.\n\nTo make the argument logically valid, we would need to have additional information or premises that establish a bi-conditional relationship between the two statements, i.e., P if and only if Q.\n\nAnswer: no"
