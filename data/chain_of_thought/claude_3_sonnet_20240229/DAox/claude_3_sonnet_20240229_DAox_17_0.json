In this case, A is \"the flob was skizzled\", and B is \"the flob movated\".\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The flob was not movated\" from these premises, we need to consider the logical implications of the premises.\n\nIf the first premise (\"The flob was not skizzled\") is true, and the second premise (\"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated\") is also true, then we can logically conclude that \"The flob was not movated\" is true.\n\nThis is because the second premise states that if the condition \"the flob was skizzled\" is true, then the consequence \"the flob movated\" must also be true. However, the first premise tells us that the condition \"the flob was skizzled\" is false. Therefore, according to the rules of logic, we can infer that the consequence \"the flob movated\" is also false.\n\nIn other words, if the condition for the consequence to be true is false, then the consequence itself must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes"
