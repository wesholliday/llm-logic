In other words, if A is false, B can be either true or false, and we cannot make any definite conclusion about B.\n\nIn this case, the first statement tells us that \"The zinger was not fraggled,\" which is the negation of the antecedent (A) in the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively infer whether \"The zinger was smoogled\" or \"The zinger was not smoogled.\" The conditional statement does not provide enough information to draw a conclusion about the consequent when the antecedent is false.\n\nAnswer: no"
