In this case, A is \"the smonk was vreebled\", and B is \"the smonk plagged\".\n\nThe first statement directly negates A, by saying \"The smonk was not vreebled\".\n\nIn logic, if the premise (A) of a conditional statement (\"If A, then B\") is false, then the entire conditional statement is true, regardless of whether B is true or false.\n\nTherefore, since \"The smonk was not vreebled\" (which negates A), we can conclude that the conditional statement \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged\" is true, without needing to know whether B (\"the smonk plagged\") is true or false.\n\nSo, from the given statements, we cannot definitively infer whether \"The smonk was not plagged\" is true or false.\n\nAnswer: no"
