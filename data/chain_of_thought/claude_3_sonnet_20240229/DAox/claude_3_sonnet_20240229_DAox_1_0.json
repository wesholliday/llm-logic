In other words, if P is false, Q can be either true or false.\n\nIn this case, the first statement tells us that \"The flugel was not blimmed,\" which is the negation of the antecedent (P) in the second statement.\n\nSince the antecedent (P) is false, we cannot make any definite conclusion about the consequent (Q), which is \"the flugel was zargled.\"\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot logically infer whether \"The flugel was not zargled\" is true or false.\n\nAnswer: no"
