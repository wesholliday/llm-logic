The contrapositive of this is \"If not B, then not A\".\n\nSo from Premise 2, we can derive:\n\"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\"\n\nNow, we combine this with Premise 1:\n\"The dreb was not vroombed\"\n\nUsing modus ponens, from these two statements we can conclude:\n\nAnswer: yes"
