            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the form:\nPremise 1: A or B (The book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table)\nPremise 2: Not B (The book isn't resting on the table)\nConclusion: A (The book is on the shelf)\n\nThis logical form is known as \"Disjunctive Syllogism\" or \"Disjunction Elimination.\"\n\nStep 2: Check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\nIn this form of argument, if one of the disjuncts (options) in the first premise is negated in the second premise, then the remaining disjunct must be true. This is based on the principle of non-contradiction, which states that a statement and its negation cannot both be false.\n\nIn this case, the second premise negates the second disjunct (B) of the first premise. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the first disjunct (A) must be true.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the argument.\nSince the conclusion (A) follows necessarily from the premises (A or B, and Not B), the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
