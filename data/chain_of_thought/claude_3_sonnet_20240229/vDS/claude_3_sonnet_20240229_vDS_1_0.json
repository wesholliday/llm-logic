Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden (Premise 1)\n2. Fido is not in the garden (Premise 2)\n\nSince Premise 2 eliminates one of the possibilities in Premise 1, the only remaining possibility is that Fido is inside.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Fido is inside\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
