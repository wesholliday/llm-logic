            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the form of a disjunctive syllogism:\nPremise 1: P or Q (Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it is blending in on the floor)\nPremise 2: Not Q (The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor)\nConclusion: Therefore, P (The missing puzzle piece is in the box)\n\nStep 2: Check if the argument follows the valid form of a disjunctive syllogism.\nIn a disjunctive syllogism, if one of the disjuncts (options) in the first premise is denied in the second premise, then the conclusion must be the other disjunct.\n\nIn this case, the first premise states that either P (the missing puzzle piece is in the box) or Q (it is blending in on the floor) is true. The second premise denies Q (the missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor). Therefore, according to the valid form of a disjunctive syllogism, the conclusion must be P (the missing puzzle piece is in the box).\n\nStep 3: Determine if the argument is logically valid.\nSince the argument follows the valid form of a disjunctive syllogism, it is logically valid. If the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
