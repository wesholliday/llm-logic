            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the form of a disjunctive syllogism:\nPremise 1: P or Q (Either the keys are in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet)\nPremise 2: Not Q (The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet)\nConclusion: Therefore, P (The keys are in the drawer)\n\nStep 2: Check if the argument follows the valid form of a disjunctive syllogism.\nIn a valid disjunctive syllogism, if one of the disjuncts (options) in the first premise is denied in the second premise, then the conclusion must be the other disjunct.\n\nIn this case, the second premise denies the disjunct \"the keys are dangling in the cabinet\" (Not Q), so the conclusion must be the other disjunct, \"the keys are in the drawer\" (P).\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the argument.\nSince the argument follows the valid form of a disjunctive syllogism, and the premises are stated to be true, the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
