            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the form:\nPremise 1: A or B (The notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand)\nPremise 2: Not B (The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand)\nConclusion: Therefore, A (The notebook is in the drawer)\n\nThis logical form is known as \"Disjunctive Syllogism\" or \"Disjunction Elimination.\"\n\nStep 2: Check if the argument follows the valid form of Disjunctive Syllogism.\nFor an argument of this form to be valid, the following conditions must be met:\n1. The first premise must be a disjunction (either A or B).\n2. The second premise must deny one of the disjuncts (not B).\n3. The conclusion must affirm the other disjunct (A).\n\nStep 3: Evaluate if the argument meets the conditions.\n1. The first premise is a disjunction: \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand.\"\n2. The second premise denies one of the disjuncts: \"The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand.\"\n3. The conclusion affirms the other disjunct: \"The notebook is in the drawer.\"\n\nSince all three conditions are met, the argument follows the valid form of Disjunctive Syllogism.\n\nAnswer: yes"
