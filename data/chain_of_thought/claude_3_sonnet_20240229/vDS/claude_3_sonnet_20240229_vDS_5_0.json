            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, assuming the premises are true.\n\nStep 1: Identify the argument form.\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: P or Q (Either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry)\nPremise 2: Not Q (The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry)\nConclusion: P (The cookies are in the jar)\n\nThis argument form is known as Disjunctive Syllogism, which is a valid argument form.\n\nStep 2: Check if the argument follows the valid form.\nIn the Disjunctive Syllogism form, if one of the disjuncts (P or Q) is affirmed, and the other disjunct (Q) is denied, then the remaining disjunct (P) must be true.\n\nIn this argument:\nPremise 1 affirms the disjunction: \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry.\"\nPremise 2 denies one of the disjuncts: \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry.\"\nTherefore, the remaining disjunct, \"The cookies are in the jar,\" must be true.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the argument.\nSince the argument follows the valid form of Disjunctive Syllogism, and the premises are consistent (they don't contradict each other), the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
