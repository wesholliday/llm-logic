            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: A or B (Disjunctive premise)\nPremise 2: Not B\nConclusion: Therefore, A\n\nThis form is known as Disjunctive Syllogism, which is a valid argument form.\n\nStep 2: Check if the premises are true or false.\nIn this case, we are not given any information about the truth or falsity of the premises. We are only asked to evaluate the logical validity of the argument form.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the argument form.\nThe Disjunctive Syllogism argument form is valid because if one of the disjuncts (A or B) is true, and the other disjunct (B) is false, then the remaining disjunct (A) must be true.\n\nIn this specific argument:\nPremise 1: Either the remote control is on the coffee table (A) or it is hiding under the couch (B).\nPremise 2: The remote control isn't hiding under the couch (Not B).\nConclusion: The remote control is on the coffee table (A).\n\nSince the premises lead to the conclusion by the valid argument form of Disjunctive Syllogism, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
