            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the form:\nPremise 1: A or B (The pen is in my bag or it is on my desk)\nPremise 2: Not B (The pen isn't on my desk)\nConclusion: Therefore, A (The pen is in my bag)\n\nThis form is known as \"Disjunctive Syllogism\" or \"Disjunction Elimination.\"\n\nStep 2: Check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\nIn a disjunctive syllogism, if one of the disjuncts (options) in the first premise is denied in the second premise, then the other disjunct must be true.\n\nIn this case, the first premise states that either the pen is in the bag or on the desk. The second premise denies that the pen is on the desk. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the pen is in the bag.\n\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument.\nSince the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
