            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the form:\nPremise 1: A or B (The sunglasses are in her bag or they are perched on her head)\nPremise 2: Not B (The sunglasses are not perched on her head)\nConclusion: Therefore, A (The sunglasses are in her bag)\n\nThis logical form is known as \"Disjunctive Syllogism\" or \"Disjunction Elimination.\"\n\nStep 2: Check if the argument follows the valid logical form.\nIn the valid form of Disjunctive Syllogism, if one of the disjuncts (options) in the first premise is denied in the second premise, then the conclusion must be the remaining disjunct.\n\nIn this case, the first premise states that either A (the sunglasses are in her bag) or B (they are perched on her head) is true. The second premise denies B (they are not perched on her head). Therefore, the only remaining possibility is A (the sunglasses are in her bag), which is the conclusion.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the argument is logically valid.\nSince the argument follows the valid logical form of Disjunctive Syllogism, and the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
