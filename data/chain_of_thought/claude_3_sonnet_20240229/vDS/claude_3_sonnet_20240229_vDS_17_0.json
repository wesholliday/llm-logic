            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the form of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid argument form.\n\nThe logical form is:\nPremise 1: P or Q (Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it is draped on the coat rack)\nPremise 2: Not Q (The scarf isn't draped on the coat rack)\nConclusion: Therefore, P (The scarf is stuffed in my backpack)\n\nStep 2: Check if the argument follows the valid form of a disjunctive syllogism.\nIn a disjunctive syllogism, if one of the disjuncts (options) in the first premise is denied in the second premise, then the conclusion must be the other disjunct.\n\nIn this argument:\n- The first premise states a disjunction (either P or Q).\n- The second premise denies one of the disjuncts (not Q).\n- The conclusion affirms the other disjunct (P).\n\nTherefore, the argument follows the valid form of a disjunctive syllogism.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the argument is logically valid.\nAn argument is logically valid if the conclusion must be true whenever the premises are true, based solely on the logical form of the argument.\n\nIn this case, the argument follows the valid form of a disjunctive syllogism, which means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
