In other words, if we know \"If A, then B\" and we know B is true, we cannot conclude that A is true.\n\nStep 4: Determine the answer.\nSince we cannot infer \"Alex finished the race\" from the given statements, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no\n\nWhile we know that \"Chris finished the race,\" we cannot conclude that \"Alex finished the race\" based solely on the given information. The conditional statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" does not guarantee that Alex finished the race, even if Chris did finish the race."
