            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n2. \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. It has the form:\nIf A (antecedent), then B (consequent).\n\nThe second statement affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn propositional logic, when the consequent of a conditional statement is true, we cannot infer the truth of the antecedent. This is known as the \"fallacy of affirming the consequent.\"\n\nTo illustrate, consider the following example:\n\"If it rains, then the ground will be wet.\"\n\"The ground is wet.\"\nFrom these statements, we cannot conclude that it rained, as there could be other reasons for the ground being wet (e.g., a sprinkler system, a spill, etc.).\n\nSimilarly, in our case, even though we know that \"Mark bought the blue shirt,\" we cannot infer that \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" based solely on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
