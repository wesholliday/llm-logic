This is known as the \"fallacy of affirming the consequent.\"\n\nIn other words, if we have \"P \u2192 Q\" and \"Q,\" we cannot conclude \"P\" is true. There could be other reasons for \"Q\" to be true, not necessarily because of \"P.\"\n\nAnswer: no\n\nWe cannot infer \"The book was written by James\" from the given statements. The fact that the book is a mystery novel does not necessarily mean it was written by James, as there could be other authors who write mystery novels."
