            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\n2. \"The truck was metal.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the doll was plastic,\" and B is \"the truck was metal.\"\n\nThe second statement affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn propositional logic, affirming the consequent of a conditional statement does not allow us to infer the antecedent (A). In other words, from \"If A, then B\" and \"B is true,\" we cannot conclude that \"A is true.\"\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The first statement establishes a sufficient condition for the truck to be metal: If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n2. The second statement confirms that the truck was metal.\n3. However, the truck being metal could have other reasons besides the doll being plastic.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer from these two statements alone that the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: no"
