            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\"\n2. \"The pants were denim.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the shirt was cotton,\" and B is \"the pants were denim.\"\n\nThe second statement affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn propositional logic, affirming the consequent of a conditional statement does not allow us to infer the antecedent (A). In other words, from \"If A, then B\" and \"B is true,\" we cannot conclude that \"A is true.\"\n\nThis is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent, which is an invalid form of reasoning.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot logically infer that \"The shirt was cotton.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
