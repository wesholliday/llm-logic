This is known as the \"fallacy of affirming the consequent,\" and it is an invalid form of reasoning.\n\nTo illustrate this, consider the following example:\n\"If it rains, the ground will be wet.\"\n\"The ground is wet.\"\nFrom these statements, we cannot conclude that \"it rained\" because there could be other reasons for the ground to be wet, such as a sprinkler system or a spill.\n\nSimilarly, in our case, the fact that \"Erin took a train\" does not necessarily imply that \"Sam took a plane.\" There could be other reasons for Erin to take a train, independent of whether Sam took a plane or not.\n\nAnswer: no"
