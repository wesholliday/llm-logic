            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\"\n2. \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. It has the form:\n\nIf A (antecedent), then B (consequent).\n\nIn this case, A is \"Tom watched football,\" and B is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nThe second statement affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"Tom watched football\" from these statements, we need to consider the logical rules of inference.\n\nOne of the valid rules of inference is the Modus Ponens (Mode that affirms), which states:\n\nIf A is true, and the conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is true, then we can infer that B is true.\n\nHowever, in this case, we have the consequent (B) affirmed, but we cannot infer the antecedent (A) from the given statements. This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent, which is an invalid form of reasoning.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nWe cannot infer \"Tom watched football\" from the given statements. The affirmation of the consequent (\"Jen watched basketball\") does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (\"Tom watched football\")."
