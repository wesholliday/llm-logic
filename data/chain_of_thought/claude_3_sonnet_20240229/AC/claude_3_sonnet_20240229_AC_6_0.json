It has the form:\n\nIf A (antecedent), then B (consequent)\n\nIn this case, A is \"Sue chose pizza,\" and B is \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\nThe second statement directly affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"Sue chose pizza\" from these statements, we need to consider the logical rules of inference.\n\nOne of the valid rules of inference is the modus ponens rule, which states:\n\nIf A is true, and the conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is true, then we can infer that B is true.\n\nIn our case, we have:\n- \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" (the conditional statement)\n- \"Bob chose pasta\" (the consequent is true)\n\nTherefore, by applying the modus ponens rule, we can infer that the antecedent \"Sue chose pizza\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
