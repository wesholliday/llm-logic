It has the form:\nIf A (the alien visited Mars), then B (the robot visited Jupiter).\n\nThe second statement affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn propositional logic, affirming the consequent of a conditional statement does not allow us to infer the antecedent (A). This is known as the \"fallacy of affirming the consequent,\" and it is an invalid form of reasoning.\n\nIn other words, from the given statements, we cannot logically conclude that \"The alien visited Mars.\"\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The first statement establishes a conditional relationship: If A (the alien visited Mars), then B (the robot visited Jupiter).\n2. The second statement affirms the consequent B (the robot visited Jupiter).\n3. However, affirming the consequent B does not necessarily imply that the antecedent A (the alien visited Mars) is true.\n4. There could be other reasons or conditions that led to the robot visiting Jupiter, independent of whether the alien visited Mars or not.\n\nAnswer: no"
