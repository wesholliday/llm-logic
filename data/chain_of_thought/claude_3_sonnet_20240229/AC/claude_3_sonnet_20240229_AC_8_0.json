            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n2. \"The mummy was awake.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the vampire was awake,\" and B is \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\nThe second statement affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn propositional logic, affirming the consequent of a conditional statement does not allow us to infer the antecedent (A). In other words, from \"If A, then B\" and \"B,\" we cannot conclude \"A.\"\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The first statement establishes a sufficient condition for the mummy to be awake: if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n2. The second statement confirms that the mummy was awake.\n3. However, the mummy being awake could have other reasons besides the vampire being awake.\n4. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that the vampire was awake based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
