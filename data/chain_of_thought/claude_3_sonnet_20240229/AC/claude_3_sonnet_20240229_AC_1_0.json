It has the form:\nIf A (antecedent), then B (consequent).\n\nThe second statement affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn propositional logic, affirming the consequent of a conditional statement does not allow us to infer the antecedent. In other words, from the statements:\n\"If A, then B\" and \"B is true\"\nWe cannot conclude that \"A is true.\"\n\nThis is because there could be other reasons or conditions that lead to B being true, independent of A being true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements:\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n2. \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nWe cannot logically infer:\n\"Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
