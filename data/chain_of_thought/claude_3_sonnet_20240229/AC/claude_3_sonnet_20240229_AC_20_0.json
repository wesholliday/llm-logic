            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n2. \"The banana was yellow.\"\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the first statement.\nThe statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the apple was red,\" and B is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\nThe statement \"The banana was yellow\" affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of inference.\nIn propositional logic, affirming the consequent of a conditional statement does not allow us to infer the antecedent. In other words, if we know \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is true, we cannot conclude that A is true.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the conclusion.\nSince we cannot infer the antecedent (A) from the given statements, we cannot conclude that \"The apple was red\" based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no"
