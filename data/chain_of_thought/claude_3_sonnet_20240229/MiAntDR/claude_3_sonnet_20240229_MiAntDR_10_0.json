This implies that either one of the possibilities (the document being signed or the document being notarized) or both possibilities could be true.\n\nSince the statement explicitly mentions \"the document might be notarized\" as one of the possibilities, we can logically infer that this specific possibility is included within the broader disjunctive statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
