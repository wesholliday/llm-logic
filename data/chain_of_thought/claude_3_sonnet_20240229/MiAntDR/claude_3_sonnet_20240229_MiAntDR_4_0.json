            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The meeting might be at 2 PM or cancelled\" presents two possible scenarios: either the meeting will take place at 2 PM, or it will be cancelled. By using the word \"or,\" the statement implies that one of these two options will occur, but it does not specify which one. Therefore, the statement \"The meeting might be cancelled\" is a valid inference because it is one of the two possibilities mentioned in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
