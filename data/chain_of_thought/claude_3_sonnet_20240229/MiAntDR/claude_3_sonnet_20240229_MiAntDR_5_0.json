            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package might be delivered today or tomorrow\" implies that there are two possible scenarios: either the package will be delivered today, or it will be delivered tomorrow. This is an inclusive disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two options must be true.\n\nIf the statement \"The package might be delivered today or tomorrow\" is true, then it logically follows that \"The package might be delivered tomorrow\" is also true. This is because the second statement is one of the possible scenarios covered by the original statement.\n\nIn other words, if we know that the package might be delivered today or tomorrow, then we can infer that one of those possibilities is that the package might be delivered tomorrow.\n\nAnswer: yes"
