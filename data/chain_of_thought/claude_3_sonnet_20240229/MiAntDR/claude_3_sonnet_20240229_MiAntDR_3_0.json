            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The keys might be in the drawer or on the table\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning it presents two possibilities: either the keys are in the drawer, or they are on the table. When we have a disjunctive statement like this, and one of the disjuncts (the options presented) is stated on its own, we can logically infer that it is a possibility.\n\nIn this case, since \"the keys might be on the table\" is one of the disjuncts presented in the original statement, we can infer that it is a valid possibility based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: yes"
