            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The flight might be delayed or on time\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning it presents two possibilities: either the flight is delayed, or it is on time. This disjunctive statement does not exclude the possibility that the flight might be on time. In fact, it explicitly states that being on time is one of the two possible outcomes. Therefore, we can logically infer the statement \"The flight might be on time\" from the original disjunctive statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
