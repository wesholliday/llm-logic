If the first part of the disjunctive statement (\"the zinger is smoogled\") is true, then the second premise contradicts it, making the set of premises inconsistent.\n\n2. If the first part of the disjunctive statement (\"the zinger is smoogled\") is false, then the second part (\"it is fraggled\") must be true to satisfy the disjunctive statement.\n\nSince the second possibility is the only way to make the premises consistent, we can infer that \"The zinger is fraggled\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
