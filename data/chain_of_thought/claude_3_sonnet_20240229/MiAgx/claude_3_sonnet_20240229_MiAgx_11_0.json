            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence \"The quimble might be plonk and the snork might wozzle to be plimp\" contains two clauses connected by the conjunction \"and\". The first clause is \"The quimble might be plonk\", and the second clause is \"the snork might wozzle to be plimp\". The proposed inference \"It might be that the quimble is plonk and the snork wozzles to be plimp\" maintains the same structure and meaning as the original sentence, with the addition of the introductory phrase \"It might be that\" and a slight rephrasing of the second clause.\n\nAnswer: yes"
