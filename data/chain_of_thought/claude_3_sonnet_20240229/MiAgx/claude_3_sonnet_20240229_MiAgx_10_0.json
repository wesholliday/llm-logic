It only states that each possibility is individually possible.\n\nTo infer \"It might be that the snorkel is plonk and the snork is wibble,\" we would need to combine the two possibilities into a single possibility. However, the original sentence does not provide enough information to make this inference with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no"
