            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The flimble might be at wozzle wozzle and the gribble might be in the snork wozzle\" expresses two possibilities using the phrase \"might be.\" The proposed inference \"It might be that the flimble is at wozzle wozzle and the gribble is in the snork wozzle\" essentially rephrases the original statement by combining the two possibilities into a single statement preceded by \"It might be that.\"\n\nSince the proposed inference does not introduce any new information or change the meaning of the original statement, it is a valid logical inference. The inference simply restructures the original statement without altering its essential meaning.\n\nAnswer: yes"
