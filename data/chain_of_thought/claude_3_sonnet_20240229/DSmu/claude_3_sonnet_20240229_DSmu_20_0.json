A \u2228 B (First premise)\n2. \u00acB (Second premise)\n3. If \u00acB is true, then B must be false (Principle of non-contradiction)\n4. From step 1, if B is false, then A must be true (Disjunctive syllogism)\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can logically infer that A is true, which means \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
