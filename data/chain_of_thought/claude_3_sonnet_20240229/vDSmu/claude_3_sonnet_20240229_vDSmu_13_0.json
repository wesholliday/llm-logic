            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: A or B\nPremise 2: Not B\nConclusion: A\n\nThis form is known as disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid argument form in classical logic.\n\nStep 2: Check if the argument follows the valid form.\nIn the given argument, the premises and conclusion match the valid form:\nPremise 1: Either the toy is in the toy box (A) or it must be sitting on the bookshelf (B).\nPremise 2: It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf (Not B).\nConclusion: The toy is in the toy box (A).\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the argument.\nSince the argument follows the valid form of disjunctive syllogism, and the premises are stated to be true, the conclusion must necessarily follow. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
