            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: A or B\nPremise 2: Not B\nConclusion: Therefore, A\n\nThis form is known as \"Disjunctive Syllogism\" or \"Disjunction Elimination.\"\n\nStep 2: Check if the argument form is logically valid.\nThe form \"Disjunctive Syllogism\" is a valid argument form in classical logic. If one of the disjuncts (A or B) is affirmed, and the other disjunct (B) is denied, then the remaining disjunct (A) must be true.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the argument based on the logical form.\nSince the argument has the valid form of Disjunctive Syllogism, and the premises are stated correctly, the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
