            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to use the rules of logical inference and the given premises.\n\nGiven premises:\n1. \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf.\"\n2. \"The toy isn't sitting on the shelf.\"\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first premise.\nThe statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf\" is a disjunctive statement, which means that at least one of the two options must be true, and both options cannot be false simultaneously.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second premise.\nThe statement \"The toy isn't sitting on the shelf\" negates one of the options in the disjunctive statement from the first premise.\n\nStep 3: Apply the logical inference rule.\nIf a disjunctive statement is true, and one of the options is negated, then the other option must be true.\n\nIn this case, since the first premise states that either the toy is in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf, and the second premise negates the option of the toy sitting on the shelf, we can logically infer that the remaining option, \"The toy is in the toy box,\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
