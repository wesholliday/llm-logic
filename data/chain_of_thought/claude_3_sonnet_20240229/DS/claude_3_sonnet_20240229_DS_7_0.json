The first statement is a disjunctive statement: \"Either the umbrella is in the car or it tucked away in the closet.\"\n2. The second statement negates one of the options: \"The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet.\"\n3. By the rule of disjunctive syllogism, if one disjunct is false, the other disjunct must be true.\n4. Since \"the umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet\" is false, the other disjunct, \"the umbrella is in the car,\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
