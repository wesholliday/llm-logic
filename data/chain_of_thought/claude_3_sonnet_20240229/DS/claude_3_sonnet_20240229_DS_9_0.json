The first premise states that either option A (the missing puzzle piece is in the box) or option B (it is blending in on the floor) must be true.\n2. The second premise negates option B (it is blending in on the floor).\n3. Since option B is false, and the first premise states that at least one option must be true, the only remaining option is option A (the missing puzzle piece is in the box).\n4. Therefore, we can infer that \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
