The truth of the premise \"P \u2192 Q\" does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion \"R \u2192 ~P\".\n\nTo illustrate this, consider the following truth table:\n\nP Q R | P \u2192 Q | R \u2192 ~P\n-----------------------\nT T T | T     | F\nT T F | T     | T\nT F T | F     | F\nT F F | F     | T\nF T T | T     | T\nF T F | T     | T\nF F T | T     | F\nF F F | T     | T\n\nAs you can see, there are cases where \"P \u2192 Q\" is true, but \"R \u2192 ~P\" is false (first row), which means the inference is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
