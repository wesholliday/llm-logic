The contrapositive of A \u2192 B is \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA (If B is false, then A is false).\n\nSo, if we take the contrapositive of the given statement A \u2192 B, we get:\n\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA (If the issue was discussed in depth, then the issue was not discussed)\n\nThis is exactly the statement C \u2192 D that we want to infer.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed\" from the given statement \"If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
