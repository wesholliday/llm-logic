The contrapositive is formed by negating both the antecedent and the consequent, and then swapping their positions.\n\nThe contrapositive of A \u2192 \u00acB is \u00ac(\u00acB) \u2192 \u00acA, which simplifies to B \u2192 \u00acA.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal\" is logically equivalent to the given statement \"If I ate a meal, then I did not eat a large meal.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
