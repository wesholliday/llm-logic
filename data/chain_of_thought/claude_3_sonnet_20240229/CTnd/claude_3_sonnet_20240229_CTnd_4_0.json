The contrapositive of P \u2192 \u00acQ is \u00acQ \u2192 P.\n\nHowever, \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP is not logically equivalent to P \u2192 \u00acQ or its contrapositive \u00acQ \u2192 P.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study\" from the given statement \"If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
