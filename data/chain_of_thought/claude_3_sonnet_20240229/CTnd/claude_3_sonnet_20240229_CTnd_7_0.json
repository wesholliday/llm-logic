One of the rules is the contrapositive rule, which states that if p \u2192 q is true, then \u00acq \u2192 \u00acp is also true.\n\nIn our case, we have p \u2192 q (If the customer was served, then he was not served promptly).\nBy the contrapositive rule, we can infer: \u00acq \u2192 \u00acp (If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served).\n\nTherefore, the statement \"If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served\" can be inferred from the given statement \"If the customer was served, then he was not served promptly.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
