In other words, if \"If A, then B\" is true, and B is true, it does not necessarily mean that A is true.\n\nStep 4: Consider a counterexample.\nSuppose Sue did not choose pizza, but Bob chose pasta for some other reason. In this case, the conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" would still be true (because the antecedent is false), and \"Bob chose pasta\" would also be true, but \"Sue chose pizza\" would be false.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to conclude with certainty that \"Sue chose pizza\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
