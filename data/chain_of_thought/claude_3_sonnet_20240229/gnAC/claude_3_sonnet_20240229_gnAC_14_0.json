This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nStep 4: Determine the conclusion.\nSince we cannot infer the truth of the antecedent (\"The bear was in the cave\") from the truth of the consequent (\"The wolf was in the den\") and the given implication, it does not necessarily follow that \"The bear was in the cave\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
