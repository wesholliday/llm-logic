In other words, if \"If A, then B\" is true, and B is true, it does not necessarily mean that A is true.\n\nStep 4: Consider a counterexample.\nSuppose there is another reason why the banana was yellow, unrelated to the color of the apple. In this case, the antecedent (\"the apple was red\") could be false, while the consequent (\"the banana was yellow\") is still true.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nThe given premises, \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" and \"The banana was yellow,\" do not necessarily imply that \"The apple was red\" is true. The truth of the consequent does not guarantee the truth of the antecedent in a conditional statement."
