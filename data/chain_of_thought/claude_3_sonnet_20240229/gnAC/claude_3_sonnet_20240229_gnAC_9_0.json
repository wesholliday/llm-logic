            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven:\n- \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true.\n- \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true.\n\nWe need to determine if \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" necessarily follows from these premises.\n\nStep 1: Represent the statements using propositional logic.\nLet p = \"Lisa bought the red shirt\"\nLet q = \"Mark bought the blue shirt\"\n\nThe first premise can be written as: p \u2192 q (If p is true, then q is true)\nThe second premise is simply: q (q is true)\n\nStep 2: Apply the rules of inference.\nIn propositional logic, if we have the premises \"p \u2192 q\" and \"q\", we cannot conclude \"p\" with certainty. The truth of the consequent (q) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (p).\n\nThis is because the conditional statement \"p \u2192 q\" only guarantees that if p is true, then q must be true. However, if q is true, it could be due to other reasons, and p may or may not be true.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion.\nSince we cannot infer \"p\" (Lisa bought the red shirt) from the given premises, it does not necessarily follow that \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
