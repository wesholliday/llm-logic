It does not assert the truth or falsity of the antecedent (p) or the consequent (q) individually. It only states that if the antecedent (p) is true, then the consequent (q) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement, q, affirms the truth of the consequent (Lucy went to the zoo).\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of inference.\nIn propositional logic, the truth of the conditional statement (p \u2192 q) and the truth of the consequent (q) do not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (p).\n\nIn other words, knowing that \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is true and \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is true, we cannot logically conclude that \"Joe went to the park\" is necessarily true.\n\nThere could be other reasons or circumstances that led to Lucy going to the zoo, independent of whether Joe went to the park or not.\n\nAnswer: no"
