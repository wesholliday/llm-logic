This is because the conditional statement only guarantees that if A is true, then B must be true, but it does not provide any information about the truth value of A itself.\n\nIn other words, the truth of the conditional statement and the truth of the consequent do not logically imply the truth of the antecedent.\n\nTherefore, even though \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is true, and \"Erin took a train\" is true, it does not necessarily follow that \"Sam took a plane\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
