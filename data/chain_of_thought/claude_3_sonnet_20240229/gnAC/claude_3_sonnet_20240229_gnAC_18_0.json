The conditional statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" only guarantees that if the antecedent (\"The doll was plastic\") is true, then the consequent (\"The truck was metal\") must also be true. However, it does not provide any information about the truth value of the antecedent when the consequent is true."
