In other words, if \"If P, then Q\" is true, and Q is true, it does not necessarily follow that P is true.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the conclusion based on the given premises.\nSince affirming the consequent (\"Kate ate salad\") does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (\"Ben ate pasta\"), we cannot conclude that \"Ben ate pasta\" is true based solely on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
