When p is true and q is true.\n2. When p is false and q is true.\n\nTherefore, even though p \u2192 q is true and q is true, p (the alien visited Mars) may or may not be true.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nThe truth of \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" and \"The robot visited Jupiter\" does not necessarily imply that \"The alien visited Mars\" is true. It is possible that the alien did not visit Mars, and the robot still visited Jupiter."
