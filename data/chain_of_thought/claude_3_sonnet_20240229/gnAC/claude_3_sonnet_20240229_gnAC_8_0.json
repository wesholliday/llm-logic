It only states that if p is true, then q must also be true. However, if q is true, it does not necessarily mean that p is true.\n\nStep 3: Consider the given information.\nWe know that p \u2192 q is true, and q is true.\n\nStep 4: Apply the rules of logical inference.\nThe truth of p \u2192 q and q does not guarantee the truth of p. It is possible for q to be true without p being true.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nThe given statements \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" being true and \"The mummy was awake\" being true do not necessarily imply that \"The vampire was awake\" is true. The vampire could have been asleep while the mummy was awake, and the statements would still be consistent."
