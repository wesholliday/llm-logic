This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nTo illustrate, consider the following example:\n\"If it rains, the ground will be wet.\"\n\"The ground is wet.\"\nIt does not necessarily follow that \"It rained\" because there could be other reasons for the ground to be wet (e.g., sprinklers, spilled water, etc.).\n\nSimilarly, in our case, even though \"The muffins were blueberry\" (Q) is true, and the conditional statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" (P \u2192 Q) is true, we cannot conclude that \"The cake was chocolate\" (P) is necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: no"
