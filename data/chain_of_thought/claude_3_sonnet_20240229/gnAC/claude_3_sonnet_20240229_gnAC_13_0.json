This is because the conditional statement does not provide any information about the truth value of P when Q is true.\n\nIn other words, the truth of the consequent (Q) does not guarantee the truth of the antecedent (P) in a conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nThe given information, \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" and \"The truck was blue,\" does not necessarily imply that \"The car was red\" is true. It is possible that the car was not red, and the truck being blue was due to some other reason unrelated to the color of the car."
