            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\"\n2. \"The sprocket was daggled.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the sprocket was cranked,\" and B is \"the sprocket was daggled.\"\n\nThe second statement affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn propositional logic, affirming the consequent of a conditional statement does not allow us to infer the antecedent (A). In other words, from \"If A, then B\" and \"B is true,\" we cannot conclude that \"A is true.\"\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The first statement establishes a sufficient condition for the sprocket to be daggled: If it was cranked, then it was daggled.\n2. The second statement confirms that the sprocket was daggled.\n3. However, there could be other reasons or conditions that led to the sprocket being daggled, besides being cranked.\n4. Therefore, we cannot logically infer from the given statements that the sprocket was cranked.\n\nAnswer: no"
