This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The first statement establishes a sufficient condition for \"the dreb was spened,\" which is \"the dreb was vroombed.\"\n2. The second statement confirms that \"the dreb was spened\" is true.\n3. However, there could be other reasons or conditions that led to \"the dreb was spened\" besides \"the dreb was vroombed.\"\n4. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that \"the dreb was vroombed\" based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
