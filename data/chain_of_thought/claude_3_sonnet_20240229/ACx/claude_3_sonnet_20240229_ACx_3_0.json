In other words, from \"If A, then B\" and \"B is true,\" we cannot conclude that \"A is true.\"\n\nThis type of reasoning is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent, which is an invalid form of argument.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot logically infer \"The splat was morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
