In other words, from the statements \"If A, then B\" and \"B is true,\" we cannot logically infer that \"A is true.\"\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The first statement establishes a sufficient condition for the shank to be nugged: If it was plooked, then it was nugged.\n2. The second statement confirms that the shank was nugged.\n3. However, there could be other reasons or conditions that led to the shank being nugged, besides being plooked.\n4. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that the shank was plooked based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
