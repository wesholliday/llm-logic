In other words, from \"If A, then B\" and \"B,\" we cannot conclude \"A.\"\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The first statement establishes a conditional relationship: \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\"\n2. The second statement affirms the consequent: \"The flug was zimmed.\"\n3. However, affirming the consequent of a conditional statement does not logically imply the truth of the antecedent.\n4. Therefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer \"The flug was blummed.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
