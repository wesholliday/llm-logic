This is known as the modus ponens rule of inference.\n\nHowever, if we only know that the consequence is true, we cannot definitively infer that the condition is true. There could be other reasons or conditions that led to the consequence being true.\n\nIn this case, we have the conditional statement \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink,\" and we know that \"The sneg sproted the frink\" is true. However, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The sneg was crampled\" is true, as there could be other possible reasons why the sneg sproted the frink.\n\nAnswer: no"
