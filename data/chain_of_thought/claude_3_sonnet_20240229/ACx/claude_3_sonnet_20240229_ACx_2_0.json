This means that if A (the wug was flooped) is true, then B (the wug bimmed the zoint) must also be true.\n\n4) Premise 2 states that B (the wug bimmed the zoint) is true.\n\n5) In logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is true, we can infer that A must also be true.\n\n6) Therefore, from the two given premises, we can logically infer that \"The wug was flooped\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
