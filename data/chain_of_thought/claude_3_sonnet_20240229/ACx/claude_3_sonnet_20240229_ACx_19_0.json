This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nTo illustrate this, consider the following example:\n\"If it rains, then the ground will be wet.\"\n\"The ground is wet.\"\nFrom these statements, we cannot conclude that it rained because there could be other reasons for the ground being wet, such as a sprinkler system or a spill.\n\nSimilarly, in the given problem, even though we know that \"the smonk plagged,\" we cannot definitively conclude that \"the smonk was vreebled\" because there could be other reasons for the smonk plagging that are not stated in the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
