            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The investment might be risky and offer high returns\" is a compound sentence joined by the conjunction \"and\". It consists of two independent clauses: \"The investment might be risky\" and \"The investment might offer high returns\".\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The investment might be risky\" from the original statement, we need to check if this clause is present within the compound sentence. If it is present, then we can logically infer it from the original statement.\n\nIn this case, the clause \"The investment might be risky\" is indeed present as one of the independent clauses in the compound sentence.\n\nAnswer: yes"
