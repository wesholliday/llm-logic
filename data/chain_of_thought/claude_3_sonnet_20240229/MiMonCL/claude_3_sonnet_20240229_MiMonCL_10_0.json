            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The project might be delayed and require additional funding\" is a compound sentence consisting of two clauses joined by the conjunction \"and\". The first clause is \"The project might be delayed\", and the second clause is \"require additional funding\". Since the first clause is a part of the original statement, we can infer that statement from the given sentence.
