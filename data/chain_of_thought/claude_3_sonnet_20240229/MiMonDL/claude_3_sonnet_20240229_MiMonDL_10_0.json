            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The computer might be broken' is a possibility statement, meaning it allows for the possibility that the computer is broken, but it does not rule out other possibilities. The statement 'The computer might be broken or working' is a disjunctive statement that covers all possible cases: either the computer is broken or it is working.\n\nSince the original statement 'The computer might be broken' does not exclude the possibility that the computer is working, we can infer the disjunctive statement 'The computer might be broken or working' from it. The disjunctive statement is a broader statement that encompasses the original possibility statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
