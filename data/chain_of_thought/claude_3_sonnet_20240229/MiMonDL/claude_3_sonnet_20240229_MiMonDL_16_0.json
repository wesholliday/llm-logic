            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The flight might be delayed' is considering the possibility that the flight will be delayed. It does not rule out the possibility that the flight could also be on time. The statement 'The flight might be delayed or on time' is a broader statement that covers both possibilities - the flight being delayed or the flight being on time.\n\nSince the original statement 'The flight might be delayed' only mentions the possibility of delay and does not exclude the possibility of being on time, we can logically infer the broader statement 'The flight might be delayed or on time' from it.\n\nAnswer: yes"
