            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The movie might be interesting' does not rule out the possibility that the movie could also be boring. The word 'might' indicates a possibility, not a certainty. Therefore, the statement 'The movie might be interesting or boring' is a broader statement that encompasses the original statement as well as the additional possibility of the movie being boring.\n\nIn logic, if a statement P is true, then the statement 'P or Q' is also true, regardless of whether Q is true or false. In this case, 'The movie might be interesting' (P) is true, so the statement 'The movie might be interesting or boring' (P or Q) is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
