            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The keys might be in the drawer' is a possibility statement, meaning that it allows for the possibility that the keys are in the drawer, but it does not rule out other possibilities. The statement 'The keys might be in the drawer or on the table' is a disjunctive statement, which combines two possibilities: the keys being in the drawer or the keys being on the table.\n\nSince the original statement 'The keys might be in the drawer' does not exclude the possibility of the keys being on the table, the disjunctive statement 'The keys might be in the drawer or on the table' is a logically valid inference. By stating that the keys might be in the drawer, we are not denying the possibility that they might be on the table or anywhere else.\n\nAnswer: yes"
