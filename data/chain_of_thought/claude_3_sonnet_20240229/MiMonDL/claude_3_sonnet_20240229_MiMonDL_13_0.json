It only states that there is a possibility of the meeting being cancelled, but it does not rule out or confirm the possibility of rescheduling.\n\nTo infer \"The meeting might be cancelled or rescheduled,\" we need additional information or context that suggests the meeting could be rescheduled if it is not cancelled.\n\nWithout any additional context, the original statement \"The meeting might be cancelled\" is too narrow to logically infer the broader statement \"The meeting might be cancelled or rescheduled.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
