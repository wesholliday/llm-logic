            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The application must have been completed online and included references\" is a compound sentence with two parts joined by the conjunction \"and\". The first part states that the application must have been completed online, while the second part states that it must have included references.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The application must have included references\" from the original statement, we need to analyze the logical structure of the compound sentence.\n\nIn a compound sentence joined by \"and\", both parts must be true for the entire statement to be true. Therefore, if the original statement is true, it means that both conditions (completing the application online and including references) must have been met.\n\nAnswer: yes"
