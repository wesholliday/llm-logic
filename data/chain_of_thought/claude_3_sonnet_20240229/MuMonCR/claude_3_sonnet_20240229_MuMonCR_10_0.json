            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document must have been signed and notarized\" is a compound statement that combines two conditions using the conjunction \"and\". This means that both conditions must be true for the entire statement to be true.\n\nWhen we break down the compound statement, we get:\n1) The document must have been signed.\n2) The document must have been notarized.\n\nSince the original statement requires both conditions to be true, we can infer that each individual condition must also be true. Therefore, if the entire statement \"The document must have been signed and notarized\" is true, then it logically follows that the individual statement \"The document must have been notarized\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
