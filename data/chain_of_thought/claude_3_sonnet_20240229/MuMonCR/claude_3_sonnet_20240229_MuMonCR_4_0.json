            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM and in the conference room\" is a conjunction of two clauses: \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM\" and \"The meeting must have been in the conference room\". In logic, if a conjunction (A and B) is true, then each of the individual clauses (A and B) must also be true. Therefore, if the entire statement is true, we can infer that the second part \"The meeting must have been in the conference room\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
