            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM\" is a compound statement consisting of two parts joined by the conjunction \"and\". To determine if we can infer \"The concert must have started at 8 PM\" from this statement, we need to analyze the logical structure.\n\nIn a compound statement joined by \"and\", both parts must be true for the entire statement to be true. Therefore, if the entire statement is true, it means that each individual part is also true.\n\nSince the given statement asserts that \"The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM\", and we know that the entire statement is presented as true, we can logically infer that the second part, \"The concert must have started at 8 PM\", is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
