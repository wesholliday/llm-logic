            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the statement \"The contract must have been renewable\" can be inferred from the given statement \"The contract must have been valid for a year and renewable\", we need to analyze the logical structure of the original statement.\n\nThe original statement consists of two parts joined by the conjunction \"and\":\n1. \"The contract must have been valid for a year\"\n2. \"The contract must have been renewable\"\n\nWhen two statements are joined by \"and\", it means that both statements must be true for the overall statement to be true.\n\nTherefore, if the original statement \"The contract must have been valid for a year and renewable\" is true, it logically follows that each individual part, including \"The contract must have been renewable\", must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
