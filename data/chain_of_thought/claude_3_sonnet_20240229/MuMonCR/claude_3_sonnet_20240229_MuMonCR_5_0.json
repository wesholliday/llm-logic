            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for\" is a compound statement consisting of two parts joined by the conjunction \"and\". The first part is \"The package must have been delivered today\", and the second part is \"signed for\".\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The package must have been signed for\" from the original statement, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two parts.\n\nThe conjunction \"and\" implies that both parts of the statement must be true for the entire statement to be true. In other words, if the original statement is true, then both \"The package must have been delivered today\" and \"signed for\" must also be true.\n\nTherefore, if we assume that the original statement \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for\" is true, then we can logically infer that \"The package must have been signed for\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
