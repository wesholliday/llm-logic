            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The envelope must have been upstairs and under a bed\" is a conjunction of two clauses: \"The envelope must have been upstairs\" and \"The envelope must have been under a bed\". In logic, a conjunction (A and B) is true only when both components (A and B) are true. Therefore, if the entire statement \"The envelope must have been upstairs and under a bed\" is true, then it necessarily follows that the second part \"The envelope must have been under a bed\" is also true. This is because for the conjunction to be true, both clauses must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
