            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The exam must have been difficult and covered all chapters\" is a compound sentence joined by the conjunction \"and\". This means that both parts of the sentence are being stated as true. The first part states that \"The exam must have been difficult\", and the second part states that \"The exam must have covered all chapters\". Since the second part is explicitly stated in the original sentence, we can infer that statement on its own.\n\nAnswer: yes"
