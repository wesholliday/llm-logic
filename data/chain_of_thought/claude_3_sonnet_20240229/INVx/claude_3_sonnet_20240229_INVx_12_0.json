If it is, then we can infer the contrapositive from the given statement.\n\nIn classical logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the contrapositive from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
