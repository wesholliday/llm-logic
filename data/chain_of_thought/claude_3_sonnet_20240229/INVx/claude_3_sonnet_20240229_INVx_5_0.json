It states that if the antecedent (F) is true, then the consequent (S) must also be true. However, it does not provide any information about the case when the antecedent (F) is false.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of logical inference.\nTo infer the statement \"If the zinger was not fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled,\" we need to use the logical principle of contrapositive.\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement \"F \u2192 S\" is \"\u00acS \u2192 \u00acF,\" which means \"If not S, then not F.\"\n\nStep 4: Construct the contrapositive of the given statement.\nThe contrapositive of \"F \u2192 S\" is \"\u00acS \u2192 \u00acF.\"\nSubstituting the symbolic representations, we get: \"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled.\"\n\nAnswer: No\n\nThe statement \"If the zinger was not fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled\" cannot be logically inferred from the given statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\" The contrapositive of the given statement is \"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled,\" which is different from the statement we want to infer."
