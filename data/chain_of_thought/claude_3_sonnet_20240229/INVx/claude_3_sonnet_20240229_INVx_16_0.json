The order of the antecedent and consequent is swapped, which changes the meaning of the statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink\" from the given statement \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
