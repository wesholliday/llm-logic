This is known as the \"Contrapositive\" rule.\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement (p \u2192 q) is (\u00acq \u2192 \u00acp), which is logically equivalent to (\u00acp \u2192 \u00acq).\n\nTherefore, we can validly infer \"If the glip was not slogged, then the glip was not tragged\" from the given statement \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
