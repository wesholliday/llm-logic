            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statement and apply the rules of logical inference.\n\nGiven statement: \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\"\n\nStep 1: Represent the given statement symbolically.\nLet P = \"The shank was plooked\"\nLet Q = \"The shank was nugged\"\nThe given statement can be written as: P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the logical structure of the given statement.\nThe statement \"P \u2192 Q\" is a conditional statement, also known as an implication. It states that if the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true. However, it does not provide any information about the case when the antecedent (P) is false.\n\nStep 3: Consider the contrapositive of the given statement.\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement \"P \u2192 Q\" is \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\" (If not Q, then not P).\n\nStep 4: Determine if the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the given statement.\nIn classical logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if one is true, the other must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nStep 5: Write the contrapositive of the given statement.\nThe contrapositive of \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\" is:\n\"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes\n\nWe can infer \"If the shank was not plooked, then the shank was not nugged\" from the given statement \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\" because the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement in classical logic."
