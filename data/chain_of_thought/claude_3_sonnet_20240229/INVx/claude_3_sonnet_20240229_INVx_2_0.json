In other words, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer the contrapositive from the given statement.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\"\n2. The inference we want to make is the contrapositive of the given statement, which has the form \"If not B, then not A.\"\n3. In propositional logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n4. If the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true.\n5. Therefore, we can logically infer the contrapositive from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
