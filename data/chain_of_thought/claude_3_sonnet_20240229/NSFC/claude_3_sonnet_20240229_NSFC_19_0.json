It does not imply that both outcomes are possible simultaneously.\n\nTo infer \"The athlete might win gold and the athlete might win silver\" from the original statement, we would need to have a conjunctive statement that explicitly states the possibility of both outcomes occurring.\n\nThe original statement only suggests that either winning gold or winning silver is a possibility, but it does not confirm or deny the possibility of winning both medals.\n\nAnswer: no"
