            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The project might be completed early or late\" uses the disjunctive \"or,\" which means that either one possibility (early completion) or the other possibility (late completion) can occur, but not necessarily both. This statement does not imply that both possibilities can occur simultaneously.\n\nTo infer \"The project might be completed early and the project might be completed late\" from the original statement, we would need to use the conjunctive \"and\" instead of \"or.\" The conjunctive statement suggests that both possibilities (early and late completion) are possible, which is a stronger claim than the original disjunctive statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
