Here, P is \"the flug was blummed\" and Q is \"the flug was zimmed\".\n\nThe inference rule known as \"Modus Ponens\" states that if we have:\n1) P (the antecedent is true)\n2) P \u2192 Q (the conditional statement is true)\nThen we can conclude Q (the consequent is true).\n\nIn this case, we have:\n1) \"The flug was blummed\" (Premise 1, which is P)\n2) \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed\" (Premise 2, which is P \u2192 Q)\n\nTherefore, by Modus Ponens, we can validly infer:\n\nAnswer: yes"
