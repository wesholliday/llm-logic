Determine if the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nPremises:\n1) \"The fribble was snurgled.\"\n2) \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\"\n\nConclusion to be inferred:\n\"The fribble crinked.\"\n\nThe second premise is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q.\" The first premise affirms the antecedent P (\"The fribble was snurgled\").\n\nIn a valid argument with a conditional premise of this form, if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the two given premises, we can logically infer the conclusion \"The fribble crinked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
