Here, P is \"the flob was skizzled\" and Q is \"the flob movated\".\n\nThe inference rule known as \"Modus Ponens\" states that if we have premises of the form \"P\" and \"If P, then Q\", we can validly infer \"Q\".\n\nIn this case, we have the premise \"The flob was skizzled\" (P) and the premise \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated\" (If P, then Q).\n\nTherefore, by Modus Ponens, we can validly infer \"The flob movated\" (Q).\n\nAnswer: yes"
