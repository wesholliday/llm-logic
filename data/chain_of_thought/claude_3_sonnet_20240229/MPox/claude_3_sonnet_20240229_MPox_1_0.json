It has the form:\n\nIf [condition], then [consequence].\n\nIn this case, the condition is \"the flugel was blimmed,\" and the consequence is \"the flugel was zargled.\"\n\nThe first statement affirms the condition of the second statement.\n\nAccording to the rules of inference, if the condition of a conditional statement is true, and the conditional statement itself is true, then we can infer that the consequence is also true.\n\nIn other words, if we have:\n1. [Condition] is true.\n2. If [Condition], then [Consequence].\n\nThen we can logically conclude:\n3. [Consequence] is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
