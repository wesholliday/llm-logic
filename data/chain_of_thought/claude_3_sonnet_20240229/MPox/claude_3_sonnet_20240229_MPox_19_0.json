Determine if the conclusion follows validly from the premises.\n\nThe premises are:\n1) \"The smonk was vreebled\"\n2) \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged\"\n\nThe potential conclusion is:\n\"The smonk plagged\"\n\nThe second premise is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B\". The first premise affirms the antecedent A (\"The smonk was vreebled\").\n\nIn a valid argument with a conditional premise of this form, if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n\nTherefore, given the two premises, we can validly infer the conclusion \"The smonk plagged\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
