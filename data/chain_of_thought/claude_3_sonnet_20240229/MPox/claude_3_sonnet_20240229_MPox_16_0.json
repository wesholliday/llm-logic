The first statement is 'The sneg was crampled'.\n2. The second statement is 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink'.\n\nThis second statement is a conditional statement of the form: If P, then Q.\nWhere P is 'the sneg was crampled' and Q is 'the sneg sproted the frink'.\n\n3. A conditional statement of this form means that if the premise (P) is true, then the conclusion (Q) must also be true.\n\n4. The first statement confirms that the premise 'the sneg was crampled' is true.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the conditional statement, if the premise is true, then the conclusion 'the sneg sproted the frink' must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
