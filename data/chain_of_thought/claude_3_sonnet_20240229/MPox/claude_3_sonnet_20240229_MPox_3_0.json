In this case, A is \"the splat was morphed\", and B is \"the splat quanked\".\n\nIf we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, then we can logically infer that B is also true.\n\nSince the first premise states that \"The splat was morphed\" (A is true), and the second premise states \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" (If A, then B), we can validly infer that \"The splat quanked\" (B is true).\n\nAnswer: yes"
