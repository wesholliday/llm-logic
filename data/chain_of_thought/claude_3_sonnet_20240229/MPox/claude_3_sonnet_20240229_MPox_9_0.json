However, it does not provide any information about the consequent (B) when the antecedent (A) is false.\n\nIn this case, the antecedent \"the twonk was plinked\" is given as true in the first premise.\n\nTherefore, according to the second premise, if the antecedent \"the twonk was plinked\" is true, then the consequent \"it was varnished\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
