Determine if the conclusion follows validly from the premises.\n\nThe premises are:\n1) \"The clug was fleeked\"\n2) \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\"\n\nThe potential conclusion is:\n\"The clug snugged\"\n\nThe second premise is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the clug was fleeked\" and Q is \"the clug snugged\".\n\nGiven that the first premise directly affirms P, and the second premise states that if P is true then Q must also be true, we can validly infer Q by modus ponens - a valid rule of inference.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can logically infer the conclusion \"The clug snugged\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
