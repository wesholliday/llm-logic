Use the rules of inference for the conditional statement (\"If A, then B\").\n3. See if the conclusion (\"The dreb was spened\") follows validly from the premises.\n\nThe premises are:\n1) \"The dreb was vroombed\"\n2) \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\"\n\nThe second premise is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B\", where A is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and B is \"the dreb was spened\".\n\nOne of the rules of inference for the conditional is:\nIf A is true, and the conditional \"If A, then B\" is true, then we can validly infer that B is true.\n\nIn this case, we are given that A (\"The dreb was vroombed\") is true from the first premise.\nAnd the second premise states the conditional \"If A, then B\".\n\nTherefore, following the rule of inference, we can validly conclude that B (\"The dreb was spened\") is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
