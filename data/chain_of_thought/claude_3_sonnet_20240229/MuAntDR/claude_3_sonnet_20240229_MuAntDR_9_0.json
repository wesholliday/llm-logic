This statement does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the flight must have been on time.\n\nTo infer \"The flight must have been on time\" from the original statement, we would need additional information that rules out the possibility of the flight being delayed. Without such information, both possibilities (delayed or on time) remain valid based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
