            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The application must have been completed online or in person\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning that it presents two alternatives: either the application was completed online, or it was completed in person. The use of the word \"or\" indicates that at least one of these two options must be true.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The application must have been completed in person\" from the original statement, we need to consider the logical implications of the disjunctive statement.\n\nIf the original statement is true, it means that either the application was completed online (and not necessarily in person), or it was completed in person (and not necessarily online). However, the statement does not guarantee that the application was completed in person. It only states that one of the two options (online or in person) must be true.\n\nTherefore, while the original statement allows for the possibility that the application was completed in person, it does not necessarily imply or guarantee that this was the case.\n\nAnswer: no"
