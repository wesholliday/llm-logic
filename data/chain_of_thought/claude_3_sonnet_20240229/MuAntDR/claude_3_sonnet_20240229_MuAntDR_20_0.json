            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The event must have been formal or semi-formal\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning that it presents two possibilities: either the event was formal, or it was semi-formal. This statement does not specify which of the two possibilities is true; it only states that one of them must be true.\n\nTo infer \"The event must have been semi-formal\" from the original statement, we would need additional information or context that rules out the possibility of the event being formal. Without such additional information, we cannot definitively conclude that the event was semi-formal. The original statement leaves open both possibilities.\n\nAnswer: no"
