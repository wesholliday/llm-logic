            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package must have been delivered yesterday or the day before\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning it presents two possibilities: either the package was delivered yesterday, or it was delivered the day before. However, this statement does not necessarily imply that the package must have been delivered the day before.\n\nTo infer \"The package must have been delivered the day before\" from the original statement, we would need additional information or context to rule out the possibility that it was delivered yesterday. Without such additional information, the original statement leaves open both possibilities (yesterday or the day before), and we cannot definitively conclude that it must have been the day before.\n\nAnswer: no"
