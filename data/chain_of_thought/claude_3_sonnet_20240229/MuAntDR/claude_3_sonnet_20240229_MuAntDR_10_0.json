            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document must have been signed or notarized\" implies that the document needs to satisfy at least one of the two conditions: being signed or being notarized. It does not necessarily mean that the document must have been notarized specifically.\n\nThe use of the word \"or\" in the statement indicates that either signing or notarizing the document is sufficient, but not that both conditions are required. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the document must have been notarized based on this statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
