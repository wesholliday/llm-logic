The project was completed by Friday.\n2. The project was not completed by Friday, and it was extended.\n\nThe statement does not explicitly state that the project was extended. It only suggests that if the project was not completed by Friday, then it must have been extended.\n\nTo infer that \"The project must have been extended,\" we would need additional information confirming that the project was not completed by Friday. Without that confirmation, we cannot definitively conclude that the project was extended based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
