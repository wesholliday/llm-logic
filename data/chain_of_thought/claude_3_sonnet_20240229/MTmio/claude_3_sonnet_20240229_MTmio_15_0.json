(Given statement 2)\nIf Erin took a train, then it is not possible that Erin did not take a train. (Contrapositive of statement 1)\nTherefore, if Sam took a plane, then it is not possible that Erin did not take a train.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the conclusion we want to draw.\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"Sam did not take a plane\" from the given statements.\n\nIf we assume that Sam took a plane, then according to the combined statement from Step 2, it would imply that it is not possible for Erin to have not taken a train. However, the first statement states that it is possible for Erin to have not taken a train.\n\nThis contradiction means that our assumption (Sam took a plane) must be false. Therefore, we can conclude that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes"
