It does not provide any definite information about whether Sue was present or not.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\"\nThis is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the consequent (Sue must have been at the wedding) must also be true.\n\nStep 3: Consider the contrapositive of the second statement.\nThe contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be: \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nStep 4: Combine the two given statements.\nFrom the first statement, we know that \"Sue might not have been at the wedding\" is a possibility.\nFrom the contrapositive of the second statement, if \"Sue was not at the wedding,\" then we can infer that \"Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nTherefore, if we assume that \"Sue might not have been at the wedding\" is true, then we can infer that \"Mary was not at the wedding\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
