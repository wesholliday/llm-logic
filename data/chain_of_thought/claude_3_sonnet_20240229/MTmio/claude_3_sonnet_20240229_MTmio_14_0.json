            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to use the rules of logical inference and the given statements.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"The wolf might not have been in the den.\"\n2. \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\"\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\n\"The wolf might not have been in the den\" means that it is possible for the wolf to be in the den or not in the den. This statement alone does not provide enough information to determine the location of the wolf.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\n\"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den\" is a conditional statement. It states that if the antecedent (the bear was in the cave) is true, then the consequent (the wolf must have been in the den) must also be true.\n\nStep 3: Use the contrapositive of the second statement.\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of the second statement is: \"If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nStep 4: Combine the given statements.\nFrom the first statement, we know that \"The wolf might not have been in the den\" is a possibility.\nUsing the contrapositive of the second statement, if \"The wolf was not in the den,\" then we can infer that \"The bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nTherefore, by combining the two given statements, we can logically infer that \"The bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
