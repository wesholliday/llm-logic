            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"The pants might not have been denim.\"\n2. \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\"\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\n\"The pants might not have been denim\" means that it is possible for the pants to be non-denim.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\n\"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\" is a conditional statement. It states that if the antecedent (the shirt was cotton) is true, then the consequent (the pants must have been denim) must also be true.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of inference.\nIf the first statement (\"The pants might not have been denim\") is true, it contradicts the consequent of the second statement (\"the pants must have been denim\"). According to the law of contrapositive in logic, if the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false.\n\nTherefore, if the pants were not denim, it implies that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes"
