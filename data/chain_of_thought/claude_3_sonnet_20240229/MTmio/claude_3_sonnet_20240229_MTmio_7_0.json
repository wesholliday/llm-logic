This statement does not provide definitive information about whether Chris finished the race or not.\n\nStep 2: Understand the second statement.\n\"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race\" is a conditional statement. It states that if the condition \"Alex finished the race\" is true, then the consequence \"Chris must have finished the race\" must also be true.\n\nStep 3: Apply logical reasoning.\nThe second statement implies that if Chris did not finish the race, then Alex could not have finished the race either. This is because the contrapositive of the second statement is also true: \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\"\n\nStep 4: Combine the statements.\nSince the first statement says that \"Chris might not have finished the race,\" and the second statement implies that if Chris did not finish, then Alex did not finish, we can infer that it is possible that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes\n\nWe can infer that \"Alex did not finish the race\" based on the given statements. If Chris did not finish the race (which is a possibility according to the first statement), then the second statement implies that Alex could not have finished the race either."
