            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The wibble might be on the zizz or in the snizzle' presents two possibilities for the location of 'the wibble' using the disjunctive 'or'. The proposed inference 'The wibble might be on the zizz or it might be in the snizzle' rephrases the original statement by separating the two possibilities into two clauses joined by 'or'. While the wording is slightly different, the meaning remains the same, presenting the same two possibilities for the location of 'the wibble'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
