            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The snork might be in the wibble or on the quank\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning it presents two possibilities connected by the word \"or\". The proposed inference \"The snork might be in the wibble or it might be on the quank\" is essentially rephrasing the original statement by breaking it into two separate clauses while preserving the same meaning.\n\nWhen dealing with disjunctive statements, we can separate them into their individual components without changing the overall meaning. In this case, separating \"The snork might be in the wibble or on the quank\" into \"The snork might be in the wibble\" and \"The snork might be on the quank\" is a valid logical operation.\n\nAnswer: yes"
