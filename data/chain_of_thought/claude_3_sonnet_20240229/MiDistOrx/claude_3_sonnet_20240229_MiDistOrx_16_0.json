            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The snorkel might be flibbit wibble or flump wibble\" presents two possibilities for what the snorkel might be: \"flibbit wibble\" or \"flump wibble\". To infer the statement \"The snorkel might be flibbit wibble or it might be flump wibble\", we need to break down the original statement into two separate possibilities.\n\nThe original statement can be rewritten as:\n1) The snorkel might be flibbit wibble.\n2) The snorkel might be flump wibble.\n\nBy separating the two possibilities using \"or\", we can infer the statement \"The snorkel might be flibbit wibble or it might be flump wibble\" because it conveys the same meaning as the original statement, just in a slightly different phrasing.\n\nAnswer: yes"
