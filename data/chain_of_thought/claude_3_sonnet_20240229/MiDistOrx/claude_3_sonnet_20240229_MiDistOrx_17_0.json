            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The grooble might be quork or flump' is a disjunctive statement, which means it is stating that at least one of the two options (quork or flump) is true for the grooble. The proposed inference 'The grooble might be quork or it might be flump' is essentially rephrasing the original statement in a more explicit way by separating the two options. Since the proposed inference does not change the meaning or logical implications of the original statement, it is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes"
