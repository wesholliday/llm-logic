It does not seem to be a copyrighted material or a quote from a known source. To infer the additional part 'and zibble at quank wump' would be adding more nonsensical words to the original statement, which does not logically follow from the given information. Without any context or established meaning, it is not possible to make a valid inference by extending the original statement with additional meaningless words.\n\nAnswer: no"
