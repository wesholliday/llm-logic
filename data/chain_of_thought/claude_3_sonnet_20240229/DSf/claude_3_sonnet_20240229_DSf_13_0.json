            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"Either the toy is sitting on the shelf or it is in the toy box.\"\n2. \"The toy isn't sitting on the shelf.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunctive statement, which means that at least one of the two options must be true, but both can also be true.\n\nThe second statement negates one of the options in the disjunctive statement.\n\nWhen we have a disjunctive statement and one of the options is negated, we can infer that the other option must be true. This is known as the \"disjunctive syllogism\" rule of inference.\n\nIn this case, since \"the toy isn't sitting on the shelf\" is given, and the disjunctive statement states that either it is on the shelf or in the toy box, we can infer that the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
