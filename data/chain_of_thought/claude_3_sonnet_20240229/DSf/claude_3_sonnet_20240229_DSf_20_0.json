            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"Either the sunglasses are perched on her head or they are in her bag.\"\n2. \"The sunglasses aren't perched on her head.\"\n\nThe first statement is a disjunctive statement, which means that at least one of the two options must be true, but both can also be true.\n\nThe second statement negates one of the options in the disjunctive statement.\n\nIn logic, when we have a disjunctive statement and one of the options is negated, we can infer that the other option must be true.\n\nStep 1: Represent the statements symbolically.\nLet A = \"The sunglasses are perched on her head.\"\nLet B = \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n\nThe first statement can be represented as: A \u2228 B (A or B)\nThe second statement can be represented as: \u00acA (not A)\n\nStep 2: Apply the logical inference rule.\nIf we have (A \u2228 B) and \u00acA, then we can infer B.\n\nIn this case, since we have \"Either the sunglasses are perched on her head or they are in her bag\" (A \u2228 B) and \"The sunglasses aren't perched on her head\" (\u00acA), we can logically infer that \"The sunglasses are in her bag\" (B).\n\nAnswer: yes"
