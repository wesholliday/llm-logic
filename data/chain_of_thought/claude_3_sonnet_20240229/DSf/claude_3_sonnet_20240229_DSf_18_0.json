            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to use the rules of logical inference and the given premises.\n\nGiven premises:\n1. \"Either the notebook is sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer.\"\n2. \"The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand.\"\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first premise.\nThe statement \"Either the notebook is sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer\" is a disjunctive statement, which means that at least one of the two options must be true, and both options cannot be false simultaneously.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second premise.\nThe statement \"The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand\" negates the first part of the disjunctive statement in the first premise.\n\nStep 3: Apply the logical inference rule.\nIf a disjunctive statement is true, and one of the options is negated, then the other option must be true.\n\nIn this case, since the first premise states that either the notebook is on the nightstand or in the drawer, and the second premise negates the first option (the notebook being on the nightstand), then the only remaining option is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer from the given premises that \"The notebook is in the drawer.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
