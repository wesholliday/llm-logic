The first premise gives us two options: either the puzzle piece is on the floor or in the box.\n2. The second premise tells us that the puzzle piece is not on the floor.\n3. Since the first premise states that one of the two options must be true, and the second premise eliminates one option, the only remaining option is that the puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer from the given premises that \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
