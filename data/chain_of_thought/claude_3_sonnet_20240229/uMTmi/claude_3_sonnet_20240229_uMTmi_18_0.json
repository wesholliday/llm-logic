If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\n2. The truck might not have been metal.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\n\"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\"\nThis is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\"\nIf the antecedent (A) is true, then the consequent (B) must also be true.\nHowever, if the antecedent (A) is false, the consequent (B) can be either true or false.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\n\"The truck might not have been metal.\"\nThis statement directly contradicts the consequent (B) of the first statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of logic.\nIf the second statement is true, it means the consequent (B) of the first statement is false.\nAccording to the first statement, if the consequent (B) is false, then the antecedent (A) must also be false.\nIn this case, the antecedent (A) is \"the doll was plastic.\"\n\nTherefore, if the truck might not have been metal, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes"
