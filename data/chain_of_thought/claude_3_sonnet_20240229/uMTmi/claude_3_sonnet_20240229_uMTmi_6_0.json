If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\n2. Bob might not have chosen pasta.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\nThe first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"Sue chose pizza,\" and B is \"Bob must have chosen pasta.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\nThe second statement, \"Bob might not have chosen pasta,\" is the negation of B.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of logic.\nIn logic, if the premise (the \"if\" part) of a conditional statement is true, and the conclusion (the \"then\" part) is false, then the entire conditional statement is false.\n\nIn this case, if we assume that the first statement is true (If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta), and the second statement is also true (Bob might not have chosen pasta), then the first statement becomes false.\n\nIf the first statement is false, it means that the premise (Sue chose pizza) is false. Therefore, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes"
