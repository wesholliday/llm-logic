It means that if the antecedent (the griffin being in the forest) is true, then the consequent (the unicorn being in the forest) must also be true.\n\n2. \"Also, the unicorn might not have been in the forest.\"\nThis statement contradicts the consequent of the implication statement in part 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities:\n\na) If the unicorn was in the forest, then the first statement would be true, and the second statement would be false. This leads to a contradiction.\n\nb) If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the second statement would be true. However, according to the implication statement in part 1, this would mean that the griffin was also not in the forest.\n\nTherefore, the only way to avoid a contradiction is if the antecedent of the implication statement (the griffin being in the forest) is false.\n\nAnswer: yes"
