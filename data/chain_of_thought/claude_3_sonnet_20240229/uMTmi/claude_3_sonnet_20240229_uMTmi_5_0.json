If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\n2. Amy might not have played tennis.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\nThe first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"Jeff played basketball,\" and B is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\nThe second statement is the negation of B, which is \"Amy did not play tennis.\"\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of logical inference.\nIf the conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is true, and the negation of the consequent (B) is also true, then we can infer the negation of the antecedent (A).\n\nIn this case, if the first statement is true, and the second statement is true (Amy did not play tennis), then we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes"
