If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\n2. Kate might not have eaten salad.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\nThe first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"Ben ate pasta,\" and B is \"Kate must have eaten salad.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\nThe second statement, \"Kate might not have eaten salad,\" is the negation of B.\n\nStep 3: Apply the logical reasoning.\nIf the conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is true, and the negation of B (not B) is also true, then we can infer the negation of A (not A) using the principle of contrapositive.\n\nThe contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nStep 4: Construct the contrapositive statement.\nThe contrapositive of the first statement is: \"If Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n\nStep 5: Combine the statements.\nSince the second statement states that \"Kate might not have eaten salad,\" and the contrapositive states that \"If Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta,\" we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes"
