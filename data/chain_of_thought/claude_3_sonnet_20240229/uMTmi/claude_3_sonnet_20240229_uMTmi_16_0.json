If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\n2. The pants might not have been denim.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\n\"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\"\nThis is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\"\nIf the antecedent (A) is true, then the consequent (B) must also be true.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\n\"The pants might not have been denim.\"\nThis statement contradicts the consequent (B) of the first statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply the law of contrapositive.\nIf the consequent (B) is false, then the antecedent (A) must also be false.\nIn this case, if the pants were not denim, then the shirt could not have been cotton.\n\nStep 4: Combine the two statements.\nSince the second statement contradicts the consequent of the first statement, we can infer that the antecedent of the first statement (the shirt being cotton) must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes"
