If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n2. Jen might not have watched basketball.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\nThe first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"Tom watched football,\" and B is \"Jen must have watched basketball.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\nThe second statement is the negation of B, which is \"Jen did not watch basketball.\"\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of logical inference.\nIf the conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is true, and the negation of the consequent (B) is also true, then we can infer the negation of the antecedent (A).\n\nIn this case, if the first statement is true, and the second statement is true (Jen did not watch basketball), then we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes"
