(Conditional statement)\n- The mummy might not have been awake. (Negation of the consequent)\n\nStep 1: Represent the conditional statement symbolically.\nLet V = \"The vampire was awake\"\nLet M = \"The mummy was awake\"\nThe conditional statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake\" can be represented as V \u2192 M (If V is true, then M must be true).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the negation of the consequent.\nThe statement \"The mummy might not have been awake\" is the negation of the consequent M, which is represented as \u00acM.\n\nStep 3: Use the logical reasoning process.\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement (V \u2192 M) and the negation of the consequent (\u00acM), we cannot infer anything about the truth value of the antecedent (V).\n\nThis is because the truth table for the conditional statement (V \u2192 M) shows that when the antecedent (V) is false, the conditional statement is true regardless of the truth value of the consequent (M).\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot conclusively determine whether the vampire was awake or not.\n\nAnswer: no"
