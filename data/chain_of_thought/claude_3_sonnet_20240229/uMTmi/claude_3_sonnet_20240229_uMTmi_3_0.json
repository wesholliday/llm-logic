If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\n2. The book might not be a mystery novel.\n\nStep 1: Represent the statements using propositional logic.\nLet p = \"The book was written by James\"\nLet q = \"The book is a mystery novel\"\n\nThe first statement can be represented as: p \u2192 q (If p is true, then q must be true)\nThe second statement can be represented as: \u00acq (q is not true, or the book might not be a mystery novel)\n\nStep 2: Use the logical rules of inference to derive a conclusion.\nFrom the second statement, \u00acq, we know that q is false (the book is not a mystery novel).\n\nNow, let's consider the first statement, p \u2192 q.\nIf p is true (the book was written by James), then q must be true (the book must be a mystery novel).\nHowever, we know that q is false (the book is not a mystery novel).\n\nTherefore, if q is false, then p must be false (the book was not written by James) to satisfy the implication p \u2192 q.\n\nStep 3: Provide the answer.\nAnswer: yes\n\nWe can infer that the book was not written by James because if it were written by James, it would have to be a mystery novel (according to the first statement). However, the second statement tells us that the book might not be a mystery novel, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, the only way to resolve this contradiction is to conclude that the book was not written by James."
