            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and use logical reasoning.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n2. Lucy might not have gone to the zoo.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\nThe first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"Joe went to the park,\" and B is \"Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\nThe second statement contradicts the consequent (B) of the first statement, which is \"Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\"\n\nStep 3: Apply logical reasoning.\nIf the consequent (B) of a conditional statement is false, then the antecedent (A) must also be false. This is known as the \"modus tollens\" rule in logic.\n\nIn this case, if \"Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" is false (because \"Lucy might not have gone to the zoo\"), then \"Joe went to the park\" must also be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes"
