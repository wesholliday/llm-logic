            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and use logical reasoning.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\"\n2. \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\nThe first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\" It means that if the condition A (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the consequence B (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\nThe second statement, \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt,\" contradicts the consequence B of the first statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply logical reasoning.\nIf the consequence B (Mark bought the blue shirt) is false, then according to the first statement, the condition A (Lisa bought the red shirt) must also be false. This is because the conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is false only when A is true and B is false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes"
