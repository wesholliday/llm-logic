If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\n2. Chris might not have finished the race.\n\nStep 1: Represent the statements using propositional logic.\nLet A = \"Alex finished the race\"\nLet C = \"Chris finished the race\"\n\nStatement 1: A \u2192 C (If A is true, then C must be true)\nStatement 2: \u00acC (It is possible that C is false)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the statements using logical reasoning.\nFrom statement 1, we know that if A is true, then C must be true. However, statement 2 tells us that C might be false (\u00acC).\n\nIf C is false (\u00acC), then according to the implication A \u2192 C, it means that A must be false (\u00acA). This is because if the premise (A) is true and the conclusion (C) is false, then the implication (A \u2192 C) is false.\n\nStep 3: Draw the conclusion.\nSince we have established that if C is false (\u00acC), then A must be false (\u00acA), we can infer that if Chris did not finish the race (\u00acC), then Alex did not finish the race (\u00acA).\n\nAnswer: yes"
