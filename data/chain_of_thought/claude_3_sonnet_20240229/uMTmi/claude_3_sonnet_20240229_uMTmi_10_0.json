The second premise is: \"The cat might not have been outside.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical implications of these premises:\n\n3. The first premise states that if the dog was inside, it implies that the cat must have been outside. However, the second premise contradicts this by saying that the cat might not have been outside.\n\n4. If the cat might not have been outside, then according to the first premise, it means that the dog could not have been inside.\n\n5. Therefore, if the second premise (\"The cat might not have been outside\") is true, then the first premise (\"If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside\") must be false.\n\n6. The only way for both premises to be true is if the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: yes"
