            "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\"\n   This is an implication statement: If A (apple is red), then B (banana is yellow).\n\n2. The second premise is: \"Also, the banana might not have been yellow.\"\n   This means that the negation of B (banana is not yellow) is possible.\n\n3. We want to determine if we can infer that the negation of A (apple is not red) is true.\n\n4. According to the rules of logic, if the premise \"If A, then B\" is true, and the consequence B is false, then we can infer that the antecedent A is also false.\n\n5. In our case, the second premise states that the negation of B (banana is not yellow) is possible.\n\n6. Therefore, we can infer that the antecedent A (apple is red) is false, which means the negation of A (apple is not red) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
