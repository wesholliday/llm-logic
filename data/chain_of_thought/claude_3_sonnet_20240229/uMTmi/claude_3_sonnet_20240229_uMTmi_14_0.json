If the premise (the bear was in the cave) is true, then the conclusion (the wolf must have been in the den) must also be true.\n\n2. \"Also, the wolf might not have been in the den.\"\nThis statement contradicts the conclusion of the first statement.\n\nNow, let's use the law of contrapositive in logic:\nIf p \u2192 q is true, then ~q \u2192 ~p is also true.\n\nIn our case:\np = \"the bear was in the cave\"\nq = \"the wolf must have been in the den\"\n\nThe contrapositive of the first statement is:\n~q \u2192 ~p\n\"The wolf was not in the den\" \u2192 \"The bear was not in the cave\"\n\nSince the second statement \"the wolf might not have been in the den\" is equivalent to \"the wolf was not in the den,\" and this contradicts the conclusion of the first statement, we can infer that the premise of the first statement (\"the bear was in the cave\") must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes"
