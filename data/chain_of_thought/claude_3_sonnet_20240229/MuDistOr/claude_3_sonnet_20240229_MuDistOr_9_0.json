This statement does not imply that both options cannot be true simultaneously.\n\nThe rephrased statement \"The package must have been delivered by truck or it must have been delivered by plane\" is logically equivalent to the original statement. It expresses the same disjunctive relationship between the two options, where at least one of them must be true.\n\nBoth statements convey the same meaning: the package was delivered either by truck or by plane (or potentially by both, although this is not explicitly stated).\n\nAnswer: yes"
