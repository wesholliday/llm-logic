This statement does not exclude the possibility that both options could be true simultaneously.\n\nThe proposed inference \"The experiment must have been conducted in a lab or it must have been conducted in the field\" is logically equivalent to the original statement. It expresses the same disjunctive relationship between the two options, but in a slightly different phrasing.\n\nSince the proposed inference preserves the same logical meaning as the original statement, it is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes"
