            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The password must have contained a number or a special character\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning that it requires at least one of the two conditions (having a number or having a special character) to be true for the password to be valid.\n\nThe rephrased statement \"The password must have contained a number or it must have contained a special character\" is logically equivalent to the original statement. It expresses the same disjunctive condition, where either the password contained a number, or it contained a special character (or both).\n\nBoth statements convey the same meaning, which is that the password must have satisfied at least one of the two requirements (having a number or having a special character) to be considered valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
