            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The candidate must have had a degree or relevant work experience\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning that it requires at least one of the two conditions to be true. It does not necessarily imply that both conditions must be true.\n\nTo infer \"The candidate must have had a degree or they must have had relevant work experience\" from the original statement, we need to analyze the logical structure.\n\nThe original statement can be broken down into two parts:\n1) The candidate must have had a degree.\n2) The candidate must have had relevant work experience.\n\nThe use of \"or\" indicates that at least one of these two conditions must be true for the overall statement to be true.\n\nTherefore, the inference \"The candidate must have had a degree or they must have had relevant work experience\" is logically equivalent to the original statement. It simply separates the two conditions into two distinct statements connected by \"or,\" which preserves the original meaning.\n\nAnswer: yes"
