            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The flight must have been delayed or cancelled\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning that it asserts that at least one of the two options (delayed or cancelled) must be true. However, it does not specify which one is true or imply that both options cannot be true simultaneously.\n\nThe rephrased statement \"The flight must have been delayed or it must have been cancelled\" is logically equivalent to the original statement. It separates the two options into two separate clauses, but the overall meaning remains the same: at least one of the two options (delayed or cancelled) must be true.\n\nBoth statements are disjunctive statements, and they convey the same logical meaning, just phrased differently.\n\nAnswer: yes"
