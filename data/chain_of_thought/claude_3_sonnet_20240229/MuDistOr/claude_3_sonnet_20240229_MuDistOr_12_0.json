            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The software must have been installed on the computer or accessed through the cloud\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning that it presents two alternatives: either the software was installed on the computer, or it was accessed through the cloud. The use of the word \"or\" indicates that at least one of these two options must be true.\n\nThe rephrased statement \"The software must have been installed on the computer or it must have been accessed through the cloud\" is logically equivalent to the original statement. It preserves the same meaning by presenting the same two alternatives using slightly different wording.\n\nBoth statements convey that the software was either installed on the computer or accessed through the cloud, and at least one of these two options must be true. The rephrased version simply separates the two alternatives into two distinct clauses connected by the word \"or,\" but the overall meaning remains the same.\n\nAnswer: yes"
