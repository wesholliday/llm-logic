            "content": "Explanation: In the given statement \"The car must have been in the garage or at the repair shop\", the word \"or\" is used to indicate that the car was in one of the two locations, either the garage or the repair shop. This statement does not imply that the car must have been in both locations.\n\nTo infer \"The car must have been in the garage or it must have been at the repair shop\", we need to break down the original statement into two separate statements using the word \"or\". This is a valid logical inference because it preserves the meaning of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
