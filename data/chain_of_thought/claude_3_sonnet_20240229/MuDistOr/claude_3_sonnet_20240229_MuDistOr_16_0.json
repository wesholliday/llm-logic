            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The contract must have been approved by the legal team or the CEO\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning that it is true if at least one of the conditions is met. In other words, the contract could have been approved by the legal team, or it could have been approved by the CEO, or it could have been approved by both.\n\nThe rephrased statement \"The contract must have been approved by the legal team or it must have been approved by the CEO\" is logically equivalent to the original statement. It expresses the same idea, which is that the contract must have received approval from at least one of the two sources (legal team or CEO).\n\nBoth statements convey the same meaning, and one can be inferred from the other without changing the logical interpretation.\n\nAnswer: yes"
