            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The document must have been signed or notarized\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning that at least one of the two conditions (being signed or being notarized) must be true for the statement to be true. However, the statement does not explicitly state that both conditions cannot be true simultaneously.\n\nThe rephrased statement \"The document must have been signed or it must have been notarized\" is also a disjunctive statement, but it separates the two conditions into two distinct possibilities, implying that only one of them can be true, but not both.\n\nWhile the original statement allows for the possibility that the document could have been both signed and notarized, the rephrased statement excludes this possibility by using the exclusive \"or\" construction.\n\nAnswer: no"
