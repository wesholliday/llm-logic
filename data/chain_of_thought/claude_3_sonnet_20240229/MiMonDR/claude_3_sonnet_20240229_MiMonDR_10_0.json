            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The computer might be broken' expresses the possibility that the computer is not working or functioning properly. However, it does not explicitly state the possibility that the computer might be working. The original statement only considers one possibility (that the computer is broken), while the proposed inference considers both possibilities (that the computer is either working or broken).\n\nTo infer 'The computer might be working or broken' from the original statement, we would need to assume that the two possibilities (working or broken) are the only two mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive options for the state of the computer. However, this assumption is not explicitly stated or implied in the original statement.\n\nTherefore, while the proposed inference is logically valid (since if the computer is not broken, it must be working, and vice versa), it goes beyond the information provided in the original statement by introducing an additional possibility (that the computer might be working) that was not explicitly mentioned.\n\nAnswer: no"
