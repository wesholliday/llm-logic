            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The package might be delivered' suggests that there is a possibility that the package will be delivered, but it does not rule out other possibilities such as the package being delayed or not delivered at all.\n\nTo infer 'The package might be delayed or delivered', we need to consider all the possible outcomes for the package's status. The original statement only covers one of those outcomes (delivery), but it does not explicitly mention or exclude the other possibility of the package being delayed.\n\nTherefore, the inference 'The package might be delayed or delivered' is a broader statement that encompasses both the possibility mentioned in the original statement (delivery) and an additional possibility (delay) that was not explicitly stated or ruled out.\n\nAnswer: yes"
