However, it does not explicitly state that the meeting is definitely scheduled or that it might still occur.\n\nTo infer \"The meeting might be scheduled or cancelled,\" we need to consider both possibilities: that the meeting is scheduled and might happen, or that it is scheduled but might be cancelled.\n\nThe original statement only covers one of these possibilities, which is that the meeting might be cancelled. It does not provide information about the other possibility, which is that the meeting might still be scheduled and take place.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer the broader statement \"The meeting might be scheduled or cancelled\" from the given statement \"The meeting might be cancelled\" alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
