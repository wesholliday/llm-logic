            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The gribble might be at quorple flimble or grooble\" lists two possible locations for the gribble: \"quorple flimble\" and \"grooble\". The statement uses the word \"or\" to indicate that the gribble could be at either of these two locations. Therefore, if the gribble might be at \"quorple flimble or grooble\", it logically follows that the gribble might also be at just \"quorple flimble\" alone, since \"quorple flimble\" is one of the possible locations mentioned in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
