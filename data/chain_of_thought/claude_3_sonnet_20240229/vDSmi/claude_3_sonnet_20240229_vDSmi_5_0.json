P \u2228 Q (Either P is true or Q is true)\n2. \u00acQ (Q is not true)\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that Q is false, which means the only way for premise 1 to be true is if P is true.\n\nTherefore, if the premises are true, the conclusion (P) must also be true.\n\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument.\nSince the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
