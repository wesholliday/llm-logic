            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises, assuming the premises are true.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe first premise is a disjunctive statement: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\"\nThe second premise is a negation of one of the disjuncts: \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"\nThe conclusion is the other disjunct: \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the logical structure.\nThe argument has the following structure:\nPremise 1: A or B\nPremise 2: Not B\nConclusion: A\n\nThis structure is known as \"Disjunctive Syllogism,\" which is a valid form of argument.\n\nStep 3: Verify the validity.\nIf the first premise is true (Fido is either inside or in the garden), and the second premise is true (Fido is not in the garden), then the only remaining possibility is that Fido is inside, which is the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
