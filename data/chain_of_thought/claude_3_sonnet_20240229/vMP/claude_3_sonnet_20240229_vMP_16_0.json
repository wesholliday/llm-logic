            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If P, then Q (If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim)\nPremise 2: P (The shirt was cotton)\nConclusion: Q (The pants were denim)\n\nThis form is known as modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic.\n\nStep 2: Check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\nIn modus ponens, if the first premise states that P implies Q, and the second premise affirms P, then the conclusion that Q follows logically.\n\nIn this argument:\n- Premise 1 states that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n- Premise 2 affirms that the shirt was cotton.\n- Therefore, the conclusion that the pants were denim follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
