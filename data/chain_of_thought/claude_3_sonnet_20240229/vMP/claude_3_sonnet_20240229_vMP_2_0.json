            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If P, then Q (If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest)\nPremise 2: P (The griffin was in the forest)\nConclusion: Q (The unicorn was in the forest)\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic.\n\nThe reasoning goes like this:\n1) If the first premise (If P, then Q) is true, and the second premise (P) is also true, then the conclusion (Q) must necessarily be true.\n2) In the given argument, the first premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n3) The second premise affirms that the griffin was indeed in the forest.\n4) Therefore, based on the first premise, if the griffin was in the forest, then it logically follows that the unicorn was also in the forest.\n\nSince the premises are structured in a valid logical form (modus ponens), and the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
