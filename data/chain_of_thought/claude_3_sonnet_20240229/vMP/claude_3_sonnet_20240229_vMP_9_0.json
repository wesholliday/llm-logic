            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If P, then Q (If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt)\nPremise 2: P (Lisa bought the red shirt)\nConclusion: Q (Mark bought the blue shirt)\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic.\n\nStep 2: Check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\nIn modus ponens, if the first premise states that \"If P, then Q\" is true, and the second premise states that P is true, then the conclusion that Q is true follows logically and necessarily.\n\nIn the given argument:\nPremise 1 states: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\nPremise 2 states: \"Lisa bought the red shirt.\"\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
