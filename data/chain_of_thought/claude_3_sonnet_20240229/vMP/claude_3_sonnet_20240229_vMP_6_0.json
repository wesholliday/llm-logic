            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If P, then Q (If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta)\nPremise 2: P (Sue chose pizza)\nConclusion: Q (Bob chose pasta)\n\nThis form is known as modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic.\n\nStep 2: Check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\nIf the first premise (If P, then Q) is true, and the second premise (P) is also true, then the conclusion (Q) must be true as well.\n\nIn this case, if it is true that \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" (Premise 1), and it is also true that \"Sue chose pizza\" (Premise 2), then it logically follows that \"Bob chose pasta\" (Conclusion).\n\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument.\nSince the argument has a valid logical form (modus ponens), and the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
