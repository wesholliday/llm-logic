            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the argument form.\nThe argument has the following form:\nIf P, then Q. (First premise: If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel)\nP. (Second premise: The book was written by James)\nTherefore, Q. (Conclusion: The book is a mystery novel)\n\nThis form is known as modus ponens, which is a valid argument form in propositional logic.\n\nStep 2: Check if the premises are true or false.\nIn this case, we are not given any information about whether the premises are true or false. We are only asked to evaluate the logical validity of the argument form.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\nIn the modus ponens argument form, if the first premise (If P, then Q) and the second premise (P) are true, then the conclusion (Q) must also be true. This is because the first premise establishes a conditional statement, and the second premise affirms the antecedent (P) of that conditional statement. Therefore, the consequent (Q) must follow logically.\n\nAnswer: yes"
