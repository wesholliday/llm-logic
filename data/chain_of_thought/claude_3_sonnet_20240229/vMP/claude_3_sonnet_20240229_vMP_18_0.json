            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If P, then Q (If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal)\nPremise 2: P (The doll was plastic)\nConclusion: Q (The truck was metal)\n\nThis form is known as modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic.\n\nStep 2: Check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\nIn modus ponens, if the first premise states that \"If P, then Q\" is true, and the second premise states that P is true, then the conclusion that Q is true necessarily follows.\n\nIn this argument:\n- Premise 1 states: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\n- Premise 2 states: \"The doll was plastic.\"\n- Therefore, the conclusion \"The truck was metal\" follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
