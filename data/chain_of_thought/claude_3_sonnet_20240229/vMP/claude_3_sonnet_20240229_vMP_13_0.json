            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If P, then Q (If the car was red, then the truck was blue)\nPremise 2: P (The car was red)\nConclusion: Q (The truck was blue)\n\nThis form is known as modus ponens, which is a valid argument form in propositional logic.\n\nStep 2: Check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\nIn modus ponens, if the first premise states that \"If P, then Q\" is true, and the second premise states that P is true, then the conclusion that Q is true necessarily follows.\n\nIn the given argument:\nPremise 1: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is assumed to be true.\nPremise 2: \"The car was red\" is also assumed to be true.\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The truck was blue\" follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
