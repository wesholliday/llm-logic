            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If P, then Q (If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside)\nPremise 2: P (The dog was inside)\nConclusion: Q (The cat was outside)\n\nThis form is known as modus ponens, which is a valid argument form in propositional logic.\n\nStep 2: Check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\nIn modus ponens, if the first premise states that \"If P, then Q\" is true, and the second premise states that P is true, then the conclusion that Q is true follows logically and necessarily.\n\nIn the given argument:\nPremise 1: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" is assumed to be true.\nPremise 2: \"The dog was inside\" is also assumed to be true.\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The cat was outside\" follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument.\nSince the argument has a valid logical form (modus ponens) and the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
