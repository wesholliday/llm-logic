            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If P, then Q (If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den)\nPremise 2: P (The bear was in the cave)\nConclusion: Q (The wolf was in the den)\n\nThis form is known as modus ponens, which is a valid argument form in propositional logic.\n\nStep 2: Check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\nIn modus ponens, if the first premise states that P implies Q, and the second premise affirms P, then the conclusion that Q follows logically.\n\nIn this argument:\n- Premise 1 states that if the bear was in the cave (P), then the wolf was in the den (Q).\n- Premise 2 affirms that the bear was in the cave (P).\n- Therefore, the conclusion that the wolf was in the den (Q) follows logically from the premises.\n\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument.\nSince the argument has a valid logical form (modus ponens) and the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
