            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If P, then Q (If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow)\nPremise 2: P (The apple was red)\nConclusion: Q (The banana was yellow)\n\nThis form is known as modus ponens, which is a valid argument form in propositional logic.\n\nStep 2: Check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\nIn modus ponens, if the first premise states that \"If P, then Q\" is true, and the second premise states that P is true, then the conclusion that Q is true follows logically and necessarily.\n\nIn the given argument:\n- Premise 1 states: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n- Premise 2 states: \"The apple was red.\"\n- Therefore, the conclusion \"The banana was yellow\" follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument.\nSince the argument has the valid form of modus ponens, and the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
