If the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nIn this case, if we accept the truth of the premises:\n1. If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train (If P, then Q)\n2. Sam took a plane (P)\n\nThen, by the rules of logic, we can validly conclude:\nErin took a train (Q)\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
