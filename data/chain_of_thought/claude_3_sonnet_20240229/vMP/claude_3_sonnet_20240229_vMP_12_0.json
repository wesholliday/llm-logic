            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If P, then Q (If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo)\nPremise 2: P (Joe went to the park)\nConclusion: Q (Lucy went to the zoo)\n\nThis form is known as modus ponens, which is a valid argument form in propositional logic.\n\nStep 2: Check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\nIn modus ponens, if the first premise states that \"If P, then Q\" is true, and the second premise states that P is true, then the conclusion that Q is true necessarily follows.\n\nIn this argument:\n- Premise 1 states: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n- Premise 2 states: \"Joe went to the park.\"\n- Therefore, the conclusion \"Lucy went to the zoo\" necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument.\nSince the argument has a valid logical form (modus ponens), and the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
