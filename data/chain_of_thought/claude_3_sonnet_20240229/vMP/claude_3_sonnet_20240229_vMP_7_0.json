            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If P, then Q (If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race)\nPremise 2: P (Alex finished the race)\nConclusion: Q (Chris finished the race)\n\nThis form is known as modus ponens, which is a valid argument form in propositional logic.\n\nStep 2: Check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\nIn modus ponens, if the first premise states that P implies Q, and the second premise affirms P, then the conclusion that Q follows logically and necessarily.\n\nIn this case, the first premise states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. The second premise affirms that Alex finished the race. Therefore, the conclusion that Chris finished the race follows logically and necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
