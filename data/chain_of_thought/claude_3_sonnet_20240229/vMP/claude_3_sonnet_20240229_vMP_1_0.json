            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If P, then Q (If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding)\nPremise 2: P (Mary was at the wedding)\nConclusion: Q (Sue was at the wedding)\n\nThis form is known as modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic.\n\nStep 2: Check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\nIn modus ponens, if the first premise states that P implies Q, and the second premise affirms P, then the conclusion that Q follows logically and necessarily.\n\nIn this argument:\n- Premise 1 states that if Mary was at the wedding (P), then Sue was at the wedding (Q).\n- Premise 2 affirms that Mary was at the wedding (P).\n- Therefore, the conclusion that Sue was at the wedding (Q) follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument.\nSince the argument has a valid logical form (modus ponens) and the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
