            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the form:\nPremise 1: If P, then Q (If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad)\nPremise 2: P (Ben ate pasta)\nConclusion: Q (Kate ate salad)\n\nThis logical form is known as modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic.\n\nStep 2: Check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\nIf the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true for the argument to be logically valid.\n\nIn this case, if we accept the first premise (If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad) and the second premise (Ben ate pasta) as true, then the conclusion (Kate ate salad) must also be true.\n\nThis is because the first premise establishes a conditional statement: If the antecedent (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the consequent (Kate ate salad) must also be true.\n\nSince the second premise confirms that the antecedent (Ben ate pasta) is true, the consequent (Kate ate salad) must follow logically.\n\nAnswer: yes"
