            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If P, then Q (If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis)\nPremise 2: P (Jeff played basketball)\nConclusion: Q (Amy played tennis)\n\nThis form is known as modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic.\n\nStep 2: Check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\nIn modus ponens, if the first premise states that \"If P, then Q\" is true, and the second premise states that P is true, then the conclusion that Q must be true necessarily follows.\n\nIn this argument:\n- Premise 1 states: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\"\n- Premise 2 states: \"Jeff played basketball.\"\n- Therefore, the conclusion \"Amy played tennis\" necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument.\nSince the argument has a valid logical form (modus ponens), and the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
