            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If P, then Q (If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball)\nPremise 2: P (Tom watched football)\nConclusion: Q (Jen watched basketball)\n\nThis form is known as modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic.\n\nStep 2: Check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\nIn modus ponens, if the first premise states that P implies Q, and the second premise affirms P, then the conclusion that Q follows logically.\n\nIn this case, the first premise states that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. The second premise affirms that Tom watched football. Therefore, according to the first premise, it logically follows that Jen watched basketball.\n\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument.\nSince the argument has a valid logical form (modus ponens), and the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
