This statement does not provide any information about the milk being on the counter.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\n\"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" is a disjunctive statement, which means that at least one of the two options must be true.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of logical inference.\nIf the first statement (\"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\") is true, then according to the second statement (\"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\"), the only remaining option is that the milk is on the counter.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can logically infer that if the milk is not chilling in the fridge, then it must be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes"
