This statement does not directly contradict the first statement, but it weakens the possibility of the second option being true.\n\nStep 3: Apply logical reasoning.\nIf the second statement (\"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\") is true, then the first option in the disjunctive statement (\"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\") must be true.\n\nIn other words, if the remote control is not hiding under the couch, then by the process of elimination, it must be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes"
