A \u2228 B (Premise)\n2. \u00ac(A \u2228 B) \u2192 (\u00acA \u2227 \u00acB) (Logical equivalence)\n3. (A \u2192 (B \u2228 \u00acB)) (Tautology)\n4. (A \u2192 B) (Simplification)\n\nStep 2: From the second premise (\u00acB), and the implication (\u00acA \u2192 B) derived in Step 1, we can infer \u00acA using modus tollens.\nProof:\n1. \u00acA \u2192 B (From Step 1)\n2. \u00acB (Premise)\n3. \u2234 \u00acA (Modus tollens)\n\nStep 3: Since \u00acA means \"The umbrella is not in the car,\" we can infer A, which means \"The umbrella is in the car.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
