If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n2. The book is not a mystery novel.\n\nConclusion:\nThe book was not written by James.\n\nStep 1: Represent the premises using symbolic logic.\nLet P = \"The book was written by James\"\nLet Q = \"The book is a mystery novel\"\n\nPremise 1: P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\nPremise 2: \u00acQ (Not Q)\n\nStep 2: Use the rules of logical inference to derive the conclusion from the premises.\nPremise 1: P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\nPremise 2: \u00acQ (Not Q)\nBy the law of contrapositive, if (P \u2192 Q) and \u00acQ, then \u00acP.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \u00acP (Not P) follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
