            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If A, then B\nPremise 2: Not B\nConclusion: Not A\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid argument form in classical logic.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Premise 1 states that if A (the griffin was in the forest) is true, then B (the unicorn was in the forest) must also be true.\n2. Premise 2 states that B (the unicorn was in the forest) is false or not true.\n3. If Premise 1 is true, and Premise 2 is true, then the only way for both premises to be consistent is if A (the griffin was in the forest) is false or not true.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion \"Not A\" (the griffin was not in the forest) follows logically from the premises.\n\nSince the argument has a valid logical form and the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
