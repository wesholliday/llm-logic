            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nGiven:\nPremise 1: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\nPremise 2: The mummy was not awake.\nConclusion: The vampire was not awake.\n\nStep 1: Represent the premises and conclusion using symbolic logic.\nLet V = \"The vampire was awake\"\nLet M = \"The mummy was awake\"\n\nPremise 1: V \u2192 M (If V is true, then M is true)\nPremise 2: \u00acM (M is false)\nConclusion: \u00acV (V is false)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the form:\nPremise 1: V \u2192 M\nPremise 2: \u00acM\nConclusion: \u00acV\n\nThis form is known as the \"Modus Tollens\" rule of inference, which is a valid argument form in classical logic.\n\nStep 3: Verify the validity of the argument using truth tables or logical equivalences.\nWe can use a truth table to verify the validity of the argument:\n\nV | M | V \u2192 M | \u00acM | \u00acV\n-----------------------\nT | T | T     | F  | F\nT | F | F     | T  | F\nF | T | T     | F  | T\nF | F | T     | T  | T\n\nThe truth table shows that whenever the premises (V \u2192 M and \u00acM) are true, the conclusion (\u00acV) is also true, which means the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
