            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The project might be completed by Friday or extended\" presents two possible outcomes: either the project will be completed by Friday, or it will be extended beyond Friday. The use of the word \"or\" indicates that at least one of these two outcomes will occur.\n\nSince one of the outcomes mentioned is \"The project might be completed by Friday,\" we can logically infer that this statement is true based on the original statement. The original statement does not rule out the possibility of the project being completed by Friday; it merely presents it as one of the two potential outcomes.\n\nAnswer: yes"
