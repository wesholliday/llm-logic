            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The exam might be difficult or easy\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning it presents two possibilities: either the exam is difficult, or it is easy. This disjunctive statement does not exclude the possibility that the exam might be difficult. In fact, if one of the two options in a disjunctive statement is true, then the entire statement is true. Therefore, if the exam is indeed difficult, then the original statement \"The exam might be difficult or easy\" would still be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
