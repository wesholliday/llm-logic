            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The room might be cleaned daily or upon request\" presents two possibilities for when the room could be cleaned: daily or upon request from the guest. The use of the word \"or\" indicates that at least one of these two options is possible. Therefore, if the statement is true, then it logically follows that \"The room might be cleaned daily\" is also a possible scenario, since \"daily\" is one of the explicitly stated options.\n\nAnswer: yes"
