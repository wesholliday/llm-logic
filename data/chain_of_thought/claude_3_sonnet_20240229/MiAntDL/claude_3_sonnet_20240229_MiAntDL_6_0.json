            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The concert might be sold out or postponed\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning it presents two possibilities: either the concert is sold out, or it is postponed. When we have a disjunctive statement like this, each of the individual possibilities is a valid inference from the original statement.\n\nIn this case, \"The concert might be sold out\" is one of the possibilities presented in the original statement. Therefore, we can logically infer this statement from the original disjunctive statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
