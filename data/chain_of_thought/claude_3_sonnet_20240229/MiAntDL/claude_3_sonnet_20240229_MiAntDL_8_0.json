            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The restaurant might be closed on Mondays or open for limited hours\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning it presents two possibilities: either the restaurant is closed on Mondays, or it is open for limited hours on Mondays. The use of the word \"or\" indicates that at least one of these two possibilities must be true.\n\nSince one of the possibilities mentioned is \"The restaurant might be closed on Mondays,\" we can logically infer that this statement is true based on the original disjunctive statement. The original statement does not rule out the possibility that the restaurant might be closed on Mondays; in fact, it explicitly states it as one of the two possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes"
