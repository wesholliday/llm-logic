            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The flight might be delayed or on time\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning it presents two possibilities: either the flight will be delayed, or it will be on time. This disjunctive statement does not exclude the possibility that the flight might be delayed. In fact, it explicitly mentions \"the flight might be delayed\" as one of the two options. Therefore, we can logically infer the statement \"The flight might be delayed\" from the original disjunctive statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
