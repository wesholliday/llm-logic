            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The envelope might be under a bed or upstairs\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning it presents two possibilities connected by the word \"or\". When we have a disjunctive statement like this, each of the individual possibilities is a valid inference from the original statement. In other words, if we know that \"A or B\" is true, then we can infer that \"A\" is a possibility, and we can also infer that \"B\" is a possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes"
