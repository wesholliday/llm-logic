            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The meeting might be at 2 PM or cancelled\" presents two possible scenarios: either the meeting will be held at 2 PM, or it will be cancelled. The word \"or\" indicates that at least one of these two options must be true.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The meeting might be at 2 PM\" from the original statement, we need to check if this specific possibility is included in the original statement.\n\nSince \"The meeting might be at 2 PM\" is one of the two options presented in the original statement, it is a valid inference. The original statement does not rule out the possibility of the meeting being at 2 PM.\n\nAnswer: yes"
