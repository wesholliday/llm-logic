            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The keys might be in the drawer or on the table\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning that it presents two possibilities: either the keys are in the drawer, or they are on the table. When we have a disjunctive statement like this, and one of the disjuncts (the individual options separated by \"or\") is stated on its own, it is a valid inference because it is one of the possible scenarios presented in the original statement.\n\nIn this case, \"The keys might be in the drawer\" is one of the disjuncts from the original statement. Since the original statement allows for this possibility, we can validly infer that \"The keys might be in the drawer\" is a true statement based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: yes"
