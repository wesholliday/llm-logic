            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package might be delivered today or tomorrow\" implies that there are two possible scenarios: either the package will be delivered today, or it will be delivered tomorrow. The use of the word \"or\" indicates that at least one of these two options must be true.\n\nIf one of the options is true, then it logically follows that the other option is also a possibility. In other words, if the statement \"The package might be delivered today or tomorrow\" is true, then it must also be true that \"The package might be delivered today\" since \"today\" is one of the possible outcomes mentioned in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
