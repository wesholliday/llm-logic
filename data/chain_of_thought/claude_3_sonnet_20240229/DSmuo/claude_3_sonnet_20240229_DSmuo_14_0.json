It's not the case that B (\u00acB)\n2. Either A or B (A \u2228 B)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer A (The milk is on the counter) from these premises.\n\nStep 1: Negate the second premise (A \u2228 B) to get \u00ac(A \u2228 B), which is equivalent to (\u00acA \u2227 \u00acB).\nStep 2: Combine the negated second premise (\u00acA \u2227 \u00acB) with the first premise (\u00acB) using the resolution rule.\n(\u00acA \u2227 \u00acB) \u2228 \u00acB\n= \u00acA (by the resolution rule)\n\nStep 3: The conclusion \u00acA means \"It's not the case that the milk is on the counter.\"\nStep 4: To infer A (The milk is on the counter), we need to negate the conclusion \u00acA, which gives us A.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
