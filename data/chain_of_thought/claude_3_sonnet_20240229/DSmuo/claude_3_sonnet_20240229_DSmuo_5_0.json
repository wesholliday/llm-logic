A \u2228 B (Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer A (The cookies are in the jar) from these premises.\n\nStep 1: Assume the negation of the conclusion, \u00acA (The cookies are not in the jar).\nStep 2: Combine the assumption \u00acA with the second premise A \u2228 B using disjunctive syllogism:\n(A \u2228 B) \u2227 \u00acA \u21d2 B (If either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry, and the cookies are not in the jar, then they must be hidden in the pantry)\nStep 3: Combine the result from Step 2 with the first premise \u00acB using contradiction:\nB \u2227 \u00acB \u21d2 \u22a5 (If the cookies must be hidden in the pantry and it's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry, then we have a contradiction)\nStep 4: Since we have derived a contradiction (\u22a5) from the assumption \u00acA and the premises, we can conclude that the assumption \u00acA must be false. Therefore, the conclusion A (The cookies are in the jar) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
