This is a disjunctive statement, meaning that at least one of the options (snorkel or wumble) must be true for the statement to be true.\n\nSince the statement allows for the possibility that the zooble is a wumble, we can infer the statement \"The zooble might be wumble\" as a valid conclusion from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
