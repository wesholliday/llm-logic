The converse can be true or false, depending on the specific situation.\n\nIn this case, the converse statement \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake\" does not necessarily follow from the given statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was not awake.\"\n\nThe given statement only tells us what happens when the vampire is awake (the mummy is not awake), but it does not provide information about what happens when the mummy is awake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the converse statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
