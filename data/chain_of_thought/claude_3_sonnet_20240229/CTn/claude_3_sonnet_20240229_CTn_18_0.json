The contrapositive of p \u2192 \u00acq is \u00acq \u2192 \u00acp.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \u00acq \u2192 \u00acp from p \u2192 \u00acq.\n\nSubstituting the propositions:\n\u00acq \u2192 \u00acp\n\"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\"\n\nThis statement is logically equivalent to:\nq \u2192 \u00acp\n\"If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
