            "content": "To determine if the given statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate did not eat the salad\" allows us to infer \"If Kate ate the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta,\" we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nStep 1: Identify the original statement's logical form.\nThe statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate did not eat the salad\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Ben ate pasta,\" and Q is \"Kate did not eat the salad.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the contrapositive of the original statement.\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" In this case, the contrapositive would be \"If Kate ate the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n\nStep 3: Check if the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\nIn classical logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if one statement is true, the other must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive \"If Kate ate the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta\" is logically equivalent to the original statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate did not eat the salad.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
