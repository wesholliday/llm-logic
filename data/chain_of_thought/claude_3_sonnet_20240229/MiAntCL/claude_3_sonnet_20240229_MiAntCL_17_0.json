The statement only suggests a possibility that the report is accurate, but it does not confirm or deny any other details about the report, such as its submission time.\n\nTo infer \"The report might be accurate and be submitted by noon,\" we would need additional information or context that explicitly mentions or implies the possibility of the report being submitted by noon. Without such additional information, we cannot logically infer the combined statement from the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
