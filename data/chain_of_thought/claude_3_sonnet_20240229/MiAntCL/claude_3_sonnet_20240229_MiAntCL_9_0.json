The original statement only suggests the possibility of a delay, but it does not provide any information about a potential rerouting.\n\nTo infer \"The flight might be delayed and rerouted,\" additional information or context would be needed to support the claim that rerouting is also a possibility. Without any explicit mention or implication of rerouting in the original statement, it would be an unsupported assumption to conclude that rerouting is also a possibility.\n\nAnswer: No"
