The word \"might\" indicates a possibility, but it does not confirm or deny whether the document is notarized or not. The original statement only suggests that there is a possibility of the document being signed, but it does not provide any information about notarization.\n\nTo infer \"The document might be signed and notarized\" from the given statement, we would need additional information or context indicating that notarization is also a possibility or a requirement along with signing the document.\n\nAnswer: no"
