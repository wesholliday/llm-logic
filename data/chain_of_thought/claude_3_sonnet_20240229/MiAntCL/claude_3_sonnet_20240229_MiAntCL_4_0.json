It only suggests that there is a possibility that the meeting will take place at 2 PM, but it does not confirm or deny any specific location.\n\nTo infer \"The meeting might be at 2 PM and in the conference room,\" we would need additional information explicitly stating or implying that the meeting could potentially be held in the conference room. Without such information, we cannot make that inference from the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
