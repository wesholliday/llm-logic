It only suggests that there is a possibility that all the tickets for the concert have been sold.\n\nTo infer 'The concert might be sold out and start at 8 PM', we would need additional information specifically stating or implying that the concert might start at 8 PM. Without this additional information, we cannot logically combine the two statements.\n\nAnswer: No"
