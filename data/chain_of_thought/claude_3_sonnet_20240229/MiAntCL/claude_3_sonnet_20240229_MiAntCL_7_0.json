It only suggests that the exam could potentially be challenging or hard, but it does not specify whether it will cover all chapters or just a portion of the material.\n\nTo infer 'The exam might be difficult and cover all chapters', we would need additional information or context indicating that the exam will encompass the entire content or all chapters of the course or subject. Without this additional information, we cannot make that inference from the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
