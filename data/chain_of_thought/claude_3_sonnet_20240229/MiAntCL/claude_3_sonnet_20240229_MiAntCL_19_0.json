It only states the possibility of completing the application online, but does not specify any additional requirements or details about the application process.\n\nTo infer that \"The application might be completed online and include references\", we would need additional information explicitly stating that references are required as part of the online application process. Without this additional information, we cannot make that inference from the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
