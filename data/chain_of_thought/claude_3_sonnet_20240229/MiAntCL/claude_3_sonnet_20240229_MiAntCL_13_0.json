The statement only suggests that it is possible for the movie to be in the English language, but it does not confirm or deny the presence of subtitles.\n\nTo infer \"The movie might be in English and have subtitles,\" we would need additional information explicitly stating or implying that the movie could have subtitles. Without that additional information, we cannot make that inference from the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
