However, if the garage is flooding, the car may not be safe even if it is inside the garage.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"if the car is in the garage and the garage is flooding, then it is safe\" because the additional condition of the garage flooding contradicts the assumption of safety made in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
