            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statement and the inference using logical reasoning.\n\nGiven statement: If the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A.\n\nThis statement establishes a sufficient condition for getting an A, which is that the essay is well-written.\n\nInference: If the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A.\n\nThis inference adds an additional condition, \"turned in late,\" to the given statement.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the given statement.\nThe given statement implies that if the essay is well-written, the student will get an A, regardless of any other conditions.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the inference.\nThe inference adds the condition \"turned in late\" to the given statement.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the inference is valid.\nThe given statement does not mention any conditions related to the submission deadline. It only states that a well-written essay is sufficient for getting an A.\n\nTherefore, adding the condition \"turned in late\" does not invalidate the given statement. If the essay is well-written, the student will still get an A, regardless of whether it was turned in late or not.\n\nAnswer: yes"
