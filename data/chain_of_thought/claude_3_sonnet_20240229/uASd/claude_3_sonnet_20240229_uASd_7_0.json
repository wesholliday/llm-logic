If the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm.\n\nWe need to determine if the additional condition \"the pilot light is out\" affects the conclusion \"the kitchen is warm\" when the oven is on.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical structure of the given statement.\nThe statement \"If the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the oven is on,\" and B is \"the kitchen is warm.\"\n\nStep 2: Consider the additional condition \"the pilot light is out.\"\nThe pilot light is a separate component from the oven itself. Its state (on or off) does not directly affect the operation of the oven or the heat generated by the oven when it is on.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion based on the given information.\nIf the oven is on, regardless of the state of the pilot light, the heat generated by the oven should still warm up the kitchen.\n\nTherefore, the additional condition \"the pilot light is out\" does not negate or invalidate the conclusion \"the kitchen is warm\" when the oven is on.\n\nAnswer: yes"
