This statement establishes a sufficient condition for the match to light, which is that it is struck.\n3. However, the statement does not provide any information about necessary conditions for the match to light.\n4. The new information introduced is that the match has been soaked in water.\n5. Being soaked in water would likely prevent the match from lighting, even if it is struck.\n6. This new condition (being soaked in water) violates an unstated necessary condition for the match to light, which is that it must be dry.\n\nAnswer: no"
