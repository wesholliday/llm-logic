This statement establishes a sufficient condition for the car to run smoothly, which is changing the oil.\n3. However, it does not provide any information about other necessary conditions for the car to run smoothly, such as the condition of the transmission.\n4. The question asks whether we can infer that if the oil is changed and the transmission is shot (i.e., not working properly), the car will still run smoothly.\n5. Since the original statement does not consider the condition of the transmission, we cannot make any definitive conclusions about the car running smoothly if the transmission is not working properly.\n6. The presence of a faulty transmission could potentially negate the positive effect of changing the oil on the car's smooth running.\n\nAnswer: no"
