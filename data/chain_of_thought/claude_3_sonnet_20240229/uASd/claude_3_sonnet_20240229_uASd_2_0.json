Identify the question: \"Can we infer that if we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time?\"\n3. The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\"\n4. The question is asking if we can infer another conditional statement with an additional condition (a bomb going off).\n5. In logic, we cannot infer a new conditional statement by adding an additional condition to the antecedent (the \"If\" part) of the original conditional statement.\n6. The truth of the original conditional statement does not guarantee the truth of the new conditional statement with the additional condition.\n\nAnswer: No"
