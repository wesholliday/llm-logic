            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and apply the rules of logical inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n2. Amy played tennis.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the first statement.\nThe statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"Jeff played basketball,\" and B is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\nThe statement \"Amy played tennis\" affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of logical inference.\nIn propositional logic, affirming the consequent of a conditional statement does not allow us to infer the truth of the antecedent. In other words, if we know that \"If A, then B\" is true, and we know that B is true, we cannot conclude that A is true.\n\nStep 4: Draw the conclusion.\nSince we cannot infer the truth of the antecedent from the given statements, we cannot conclude that Jeff played basketball.\n\nAnswer: no"
