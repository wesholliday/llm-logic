            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and apply the rules of logical inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n2. Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that Lisa bought the red shirt based on these statements.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the first statement.\nThe first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"Lisa bought the red shirt,\" and B is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\nThe second statement directly affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement, which is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nStep 3: Apply the logical reasoning.\nIn propositional logic, affirming the consequent of a conditional statement does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent. In other words, if \"If A, then B\" is true, and we know that B is true, we cannot conclude that A is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no"
