If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n2. Chris finished the race.\n\nWe can represent these statements using propositional logic:\nLet A = \"Alex finished the race\"\nLet C = \"Chris finished the race\"\n\nThe first statement can be written as: A \u2192 C (If A is true, then C is true)\nThe second statement is simply: C (Chris finished the race)\n\nNow, let's consider the contrapositive of the first statement:\n\u00acC \u2192 \u00acA (If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race)\n\nSince we know that C is true (Chris finished the race), we can infer that \u00acA is false, which means A is true.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Alex finished the race.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. We are given the statements: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" and \"Chris finished the race.\"\n2. We represent these statements using propositional logic: A \u2192 C and C.\n3. We consider the contrapositive of the first statement: \u00acC \u2192 \u00acA.\n4. Since we know C is true, we can infer that \u00acA is false, which means A is true.\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes"
