If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n2. Jen watched basketball.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the first statement.\nThe statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"Tom watched football,\" and B is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the truth values of the statements.\nStatement 1 is a conditional statement, which is true unless the antecedent (A) is true, and the consequent (B) is false.\nStatement 2 tells us that the consequent (B) \"Jen watched basketball\" is true.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of logical inference.\nIf the conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is true, and we know that B is true, we cannot infer anything about the truth value of A. This is because the truth of the consequent (B) does not guarantee the truth of the antecedent (A) in a conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nWe cannot infer that Tom watched football based on the given information. The truth of \"Jen watched basketball\" does not necessarily imply that \"Tom watched football\" is true. The conditional statement only guarantees that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball, but it does not work in the reverse direction."
