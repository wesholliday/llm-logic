In other words, if Q is true, we cannot conclude that P is also true.\n\nStep 4: Draw the conclusion.\nSince we cannot infer the truth of the antecedent (the car was red) from the truth of the consequent (the truck was blue), we cannot conclude that the car was red based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
