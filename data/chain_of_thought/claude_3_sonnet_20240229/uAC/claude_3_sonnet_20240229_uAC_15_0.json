However, this statement does not provide any information about the converse, which is whether Erin taking a train implies that Sam took a plane.\n\nThe second statement confirms that the consequent (Erin took a train) is true.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that Sam took a plane, we need to consider the logical structure of the statements.\n\nIf the first statement were \"If and only if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train,\" then we could infer that Sam took a plane from the fact that Erin took a train. However, the given statement does not include the \"only if\" part, which means it is a one-way implication.\n\nIn this case, we cannot definitively conclude that Sam took a plane based on the given information. The fact that Erin took a train is consistent with both possibilities: Sam took a plane, or Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: no"
