If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n2. Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the first statement.\nThe statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is an implication or conditional statement. It has the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"Joe went to the park,\" and B is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the truth values of the given statements.\nThe second statement, \"Lucy went to the zoo,\" is given as true.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of logical inference.\nIn an implication (If A, then B), if the consequent (B) is true, we cannot infer anything about the truth value of the antecedent (A). In other words, if \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is true, it does not necessarily mean that \"Joe went to the park\" is true.\n\nStep 4: Consider the converse of the implication.\nThe converse of the implication \"If A, then B\" is \"If B, then A.\" In this case, the converse would be \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park.\" However, the converse is not logically equivalent to the original implication, and we cannot infer its truth from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nWe cannot infer that Joe went to the park based on the given statements. The fact that Lucy went to the zoo does not necessarily imply that Joe went to the park, according to the rules of logical inference."
