This is because there could be other reasons or conditions that lead to B being true, independent of A.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nWe cannot infer with certainty that Sue chose pizza based on the given information. The fact that Bob chose pasta does not necessarily imply that Sue chose pizza, as there could be other reasons why Bob chose pasta that are not stated in the given premises."
