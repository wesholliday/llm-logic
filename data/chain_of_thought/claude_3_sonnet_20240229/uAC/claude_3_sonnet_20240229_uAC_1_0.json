            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and apply the rules of logical inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n2. Sue was at the wedding.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the first statement.\nThe statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"Mary was at the wedding,\" and B is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\nThe statement \"Sue was at the wedding\" affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of logical inference.\nIn propositional logic, affirming the consequent of a conditional statement does not allow us to infer the antecedent. In other words, if we know that \"If A, then B\" is true, and we know that B is true, we cannot conclude that A is true.\n\nStep 4: Determine the answer.\nSince we cannot infer the antecedent (Mary was at the wedding) from the given statements, we cannot conclude that Mary was at the wedding based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no"
