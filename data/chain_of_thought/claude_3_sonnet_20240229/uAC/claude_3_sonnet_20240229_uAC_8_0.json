If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n2. The mummy was awake.\n\nWe can represent these statements using propositional logic:\nLet p = \"The vampire was awake\"\nLet q = \"The mummy was awake\"\n\nThe first statement can be written as: p \u2192 q (If p is true, then q is true)\nThe second statement is simply: q\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer p (the vampire was awake) from these statements.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement (p \u2192 q).\nThis is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (p) is true, then the consequent (q) must also be true. However, if the antecedent (p) is false, the conditional statement (p \u2192 q) is still true.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement (q).\nThis statement directly tells us that the consequent (q) is true.\n\nStep 3: Combine the two statements.\nSince we know that q is true (the mummy was awake), and the conditional statement (p \u2192 q) is true, we cannot definitively conclude that p is true (the vampire was awake).\n\nThe reason for this is that the conditional statement (p \u2192 q) does not provide any information about the truth value of p when q is true. It only guarantees that if p is true, then q must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: no"
