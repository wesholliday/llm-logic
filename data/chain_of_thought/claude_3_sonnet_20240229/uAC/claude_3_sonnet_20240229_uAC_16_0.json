It does not imply that if q is true, then p must be true. This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of logical inference.\nFrom the given statements, we cannot directly infer that p (the shirt was cotton) is true. The second statement (q) only tells us that the consequent (the pants were denim) is true, but it does not provide information about the antecedent (the shirt was cotton).\n\nAnswer: no\n\nWe cannot infer that the shirt was cotton based on the given statements. The fact that the pants were denim does not necessarily imply that the shirt was cotton, as the conditional statement only states that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim, but not the other way around."
