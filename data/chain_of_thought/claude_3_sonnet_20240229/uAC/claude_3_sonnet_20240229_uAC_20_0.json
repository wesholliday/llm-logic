When A is false (regardless of the truth value of B)\n2. When both A and B are true\n\nIf the conditional statement is true, and we know that B is true (the banana was yellow), we cannot definitively conclude that A is true (the apple was red). This is because the conditional statement does not provide enough information to infer the truth of the antecedent (A) from the truth of the consequent (B).\n\nAnswer: no\n\nWe cannot infer with certainty that the apple was red based on the given information. The statements only guarantee that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow, but they do not necessarily imply that the apple was red."
