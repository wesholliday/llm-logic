If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n2. The book is a mystery novel.\n\nWe can represent these statements using logical notation:\n1. P \u2192 Q (If P is true, then Q is true)\n2. Q\n\nWhere:\nP = \"The book was written by James\"\nQ = \"The book is a mystery novel\"\n\nNow, let's consider the converse of the first statement:\nQ \u2192 P (If the book is a mystery novel, then it was written by James)\n\nThis converse statement is not necessarily true because there could be other authors who write mystery novels.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that the book was written by James, we need to apply the rules of logical inference.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nThe given statements do not provide enough information to conclude that the book was written by James. The fact that the book is a mystery novel does not necessarily imply that it was written by James, as there could be other authors who write mystery novels. The first statement only establishes that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel, but it does not guarantee the reverse implication."
