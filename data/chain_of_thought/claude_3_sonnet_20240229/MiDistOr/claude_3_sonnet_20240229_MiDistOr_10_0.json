            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The document might be signed or notarized\" uses the word \"or\" to connect the two possibilities: \"signed\" and \"notarized\". In logic and natural language, the word \"or\" can be interpreted in two ways: the inclusive \"or\" and the exclusive \"or\".\n\nThe inclusive \"or\" means that one possibility is true, the other is true, or both are true. In this case, the statement \"The document might be signed or notarized\" would imply that the document could be signed, notarized, or both signed and notarized.\n\nThe exclusive \"or\" means that only one of the possibilities is true, but not both. In this case, the statement would mean that the document is either signed or notarized, but not both.\n\nWithout additional context, it is ambiguous whether the original statement intended the inclusive or exclusive interpretation of \"or\".\n\nHowever, the rephrased statement \"The document might be signed or it might be notarized\" clearly expresses the inclusive interpretation, where the two possibilities are presented separately, implying that either one or the other, or both, could be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
