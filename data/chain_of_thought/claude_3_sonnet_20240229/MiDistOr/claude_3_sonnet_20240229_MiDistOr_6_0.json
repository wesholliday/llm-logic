            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The concert might be sold out or postponed\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning it presents two possibilities: either the concert is sold out, or it is postponed. To infer the statement \"The concert might be sold out or it might be postponed,\" we need to break down the original disjunctive statement into two separate possibilities.\n\nThe original statement implies that at least one of the two possibilities (sold out or postponed) is true, but it does not specify which one. By breaking it down into \"The concert might be sold out\" and \"The concert might be postponed,\" we are separating the two possibilities and stating that either one or the other might be true.\n\nThis separation of the disjunctive statement into two separate possibilities is a valid logical inference because it does not change the meaning or truth value of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
