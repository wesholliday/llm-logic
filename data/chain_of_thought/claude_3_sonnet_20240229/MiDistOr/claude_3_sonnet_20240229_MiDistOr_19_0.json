            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The application might be completed online or in person\" presents two possibilities for completing the application: online or in person. To infer the rephrased statement \"The application might be completed online or it might be completed in person,\" we need to analyze if the meaning remains the same.\n\nThe rephrased statement separates the two possibilities into two distinct clauses: \"The application might be completed online\" and \"it might be completed in person.\" Both clauses convey the same meaning as the original statement, just presented in a slightly different way.\n\nThe use of \"or\" in both statements indicates that only one of the two possibilities can occur, not both simultaneously. Therefore, the rephrased statement accurately captures the meaning of the original statement by presenting the two possibilities separately but retaining the exclusivity implied by the word \"or.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
