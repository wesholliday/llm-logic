            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The exam might be difficult or easy' is a disjunctive statement, which means that it expresses two possibilities connected by the word 'or'. This statement can be logically equivalent to 'The exam might be difficult or it might be easy'.\n\nIn the original statement, the word 'or' is used to connect the two possibilities 'difficult' and 'easy'. By rephrasing it as 'The exam might be difficult or it might be easy', we are explicitly stating the two possibilities separately, but the overall meaning remains the same.\n\nBoth statements convey that there are two possible outcomes for the exam: it could be difficult, or it could be easy. The rephrased version simply makes the two possibilities more explicit by using the phrase 'it might be' before each option.\n\nAnswer: yes"
