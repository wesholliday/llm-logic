            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The keys might be in the drawer or on the table\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning it presents two possibilities connected by the word \"or\". This statement can be broken down into two separate possibilities:\n\n1. The keys might be in the drawer.\n2. The keys might be on the table.\n\nThe proposed inference \"The keys might be in the drawer or they might be on the table\" is essentially rephrasing the original statement by separating the two possibilities into two distinct clauses connected by \"or\".\n\nSince both statements convey the same meaning, just with a slightly different phrasing, the proposed inference is logically valid and follows from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
