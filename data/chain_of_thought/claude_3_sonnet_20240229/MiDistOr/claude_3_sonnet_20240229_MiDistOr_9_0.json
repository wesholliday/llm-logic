            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The flight might be delayed or on time' presents two possible scenarios: either the flight will be delayed, or it will be on time. These two scenarios are mutually exclusive and cover all possibilities, meaning that one of them must be true.\n\nWhen we rephrase the statement as 'The flight might be delayed or it might be on time', we are essentially expressing the same idea using slightly different wording. The word 'might' is used to indicate possibility, and the two options presented are still 'delayed' and 'on time'.\n\nSince both statements convey the same meaning, expressing the two possible and mutually exclusive scenarios for the flight's status, we can infer the rephrased statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
