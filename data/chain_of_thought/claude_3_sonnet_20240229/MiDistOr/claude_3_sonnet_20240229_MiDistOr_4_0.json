            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The meeting might start at 2 PM or be cancelled\" presents two possibilities: either the meeting starts at 2 PM, or it is cancelled. The proposed inference \"The meeting might start at 2 PM or it might be cancelled\" expresses the same two possibilities using slightly different wording.\n\nThe key difference is that the original statement uses the passive voice \"be cancelled,\" while the inference uses the active voice \"it might be cancelled.\" However, both statements convey the same meaning and present the same two options for the meeting.\n\nSince the inference accurately captures the two possibilities presented in the original statement, just with a minor rephrasing, we can logically infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
