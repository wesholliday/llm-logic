            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package might be delivered today or tomorrow\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning it presents two possibilities: either the package will be delivered today, or it will be delivered tomorrow. The proposed inference \"The package might be delivered today or it might be delivered tomorrow\" is essentially rephrasing the original statement by separating the two possibilities into two separate clauses connected by \"or\".\n\nBoth statements convey the same meaning: there are two possible outcomes, and one of them will occur (either the package will be delivered today, or it will be delivered tomorrow). The rephrased version simply expresses the same idea in a slightly more verbose way by explicitly stating each possibility as a separate clause.\n\nSince the proposed inference does not change the meaning or introduce any new information beyond what is already implied in the original statement, it is a valid logical inference.\n\nAnswer: yes"
