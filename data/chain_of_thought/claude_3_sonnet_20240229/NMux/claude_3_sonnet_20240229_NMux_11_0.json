The given statement negates \"The flug must have been blummed.\"\n2. The statement we want to infer is logically equivalent to the negation of \"The flug must have been blummed.\"\n3. Since the given statement and the statement we want to infer are logically equivalent, we can infer one from the other.\n\nAnswer: yes"
