It can be rephrased as \"It is possible that the zinger was not fraggled\".\n\nThe statement we want to infer, \"The zinger might not have been fraggled\", expresses the same possibility that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nSince both statements express the same possibility, we can indeed infer \"The zinger might not have been fraggled\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
