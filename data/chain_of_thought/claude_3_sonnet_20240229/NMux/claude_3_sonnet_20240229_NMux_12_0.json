If it's not the case that the smip must have been shripped, it means that the smip being shripped is not a necessity.\n2. If the smip being shripped is not a necessity, then it implies that there is a possibility that the smip was not shripped.\n3. Therefore, if it's not the case that the smip must have been shripped, then it follows that the smip might not have been shripped.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1) The given statement negates the necessity of the smip being shripped.\n2) If something is not necessary, then it implies that the opposite is possible.\n3) Therefore, if it's not the case that the smip must have been shripped, it implies that the smip might not have been shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes"
