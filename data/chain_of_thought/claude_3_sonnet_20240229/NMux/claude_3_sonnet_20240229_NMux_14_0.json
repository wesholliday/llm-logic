If it's not the case that the clug must have been fleeked, then it means that there is a possibility that the clug was not fleeked, which is the same as saying \"The clug might not have been fleeked.\"\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1) The given statement negates the necessity of the clug being fleeked.\n2) If something is not necessary, it means that there is a possibility of it not happening.\n3) Therefore, if it's not the case that the clug must have been fleeked, it implies that there is a possibility that the clug was not fleeked.\n4) This possibility is expressed by the inference \"The clug might not have been fleeked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
