In other words, if something is not necessary, then it is possible that it might not happen.\n\nTherefore, the negation of \"The fribble must have been snurgled\" implies \"The fribble might not have been snurgled.\"\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The given statement negates the necessity of the fribble being snurgled.\n2. The negation of a necessity statement implies a possibility statement.\n3. Therefore, the given statement implies the possibility that the fribble might not have been snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
