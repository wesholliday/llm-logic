The given statement negates \"The wug must have been sproinged.\"\n2. The statement we want to infer, \"The wug might not have been sproinged,\" is equivalent to the negation of \"The wug must have been sproinged.\"\n3. Since the given statement and the statement we want to infer both negate the same statement, we can infer the latter from the former.\n\nAnswer: yes"
