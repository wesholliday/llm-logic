This statement is a negation of \"The sneg must have been crampled\".\n\n3. The negation of a necessity statement (\"must\") results in a possibility statement (\"might\").\n\n4. So, \"It's not the case that the sneg must have been crampled\" can be rephrased as \"The sneg might not have been crampled\".\n\n5. Therefore, we can infer \"The sneg might not have been crampled\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
