    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fraglen, a darpil, and a votal are the top bispil teams this season. The fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by the darpil, while the votal trails far behind. These lead the league, so if the darpil doesn\u2019t have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn\u2019t, the votal will. Moreover, the fraglen likely will lead the league and hence the darpil likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fraglen doesn\u2019t lead the league, the votal will?",

            "content": "To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by the darpil, and the votal trails far behind.\n2. If the darpil doesn't have the top record, and the fraglen doesn't either, then the votal will lead the league.\n3. The fraglen is likely to lead the league.\n4. If the fraglen leads the league, then the darpil likely won't lead the league.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fraglen doesn't lead the league, the votal will?\"\n\nIf the fraglen doesn't lead the league, there are two possibilities:\na) The darpil leads the league.\nb) The votal leads the league.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that if the darpil doesn't lead the league and the fraglen doesn't either, then the votal will lead the league (point 2).\n\nHowever, we also know that if the fraglen leads the league, then the darpil likely won't lead the league (point 4). This means that if the fraglen doesn't lead the league, it's more likely that the darpil will lead the league instead of the votal.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that it's likely that the votal will lead the league if the fraglen doesn't. The darpil is still more likely to lead the league in that case.\n\nAnswer: no"
