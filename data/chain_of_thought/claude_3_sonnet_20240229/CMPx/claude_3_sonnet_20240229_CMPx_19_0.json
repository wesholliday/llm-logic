Experts think the garplex is most likely to win, followed closely by the beelhet, with the peedonk having a much lower chance. Since these are the only domer candidates, if the beelhet doesn\u2019t become domer, then if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will become domer. Moreover, it is likely the garplex will become domer and hence the beelhet likely won\u2019t become domer. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will?",

            "content": "To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. There are three candidates for domer of the year: garplex, beelhet, and peedonk.\n2. The experts think the garplex is most likely to win, followed by the beelhet, and then the peedonk with a much lower chance.\n3. If the beelhet doesn't become domer, and the garplex doesn't become domer, then the peedonk will become domer (since these are the only candidates).\n4. It is likely that the garplex will become domer, which implies that it is likely that the beelhet won't become domer.\n5. The question asks if it follows that it's likely that, if the garplex doesn't become domer, the peedonk will.\n\nTo determine this, we need to consider the probability of the garplex not becoming domer. Since it is likely that the garplex will become domer, the probability of it not becoming domer is low.\n\nIf the garplex doesn't become domer, then either the beelhet or the peedonk must become domer (since there are only three candidates). However, we know that if the beelhet doesn't become domer, and the garplex doesn't become domer, then the peedonk will become domer.\n\nSo, if the garplex doesn't become domer (which is unlikely), then it is likely that the peedonk will become domer, since the beelhet is more likely to win than the peedonk.\n\nAnswer: yes"
