    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trundle, a foopet, and a crangor are likely to be the top selling whippits. The trundle will likely be #1 in sales, followed closely by the foopet, with the crangor having significantly lower expected sales. These lead whippit sales, so if the foopet isn\u2019t the top seller, then if the trundle isn\u2019t, the crangor will be. Moreover, the trundle likely will lead sales and hence the foopet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trundle isn\u2019t the top selling whippit, the crangor will be?",

            "content": "To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given that the trundle, foopet, and crangor are likely to be the top selling whippits.\n2. The trundle will likely be #1 in sales, followed closely by the foopet, with the crangor having significantly lower expected sales.\n3. If the foopet isn't the top seller, then if the trundle isn't, the crangor will be.\n4. The trundle likely will lead sales, and hence the foopet likely won't.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Does it follow that it's likely that, if the trundle isn't the top selling whippit, the crangor will be?\"\n\nStep 1: If the trundle isn't the top selling whippit, then either the foopet or the crangor must be the top seller.\nStep 2: From the given information, we know that the foopet likely won't be the top seller.\nStep 3: Therefore, if the trundle isn't the top seller, and the foopet likely won't be the top seller, then the only remaining option is that the crangor will be the top seller.\n\nAnswer: Yes, it follows that it's likely that, if the trundle isn't the top selling whippit, the crangor will be."
