    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trendel, a laxum, and a doffen are candidates for Best Ploggel at the National Zorple Championship. Handlers consider the trendel the frontrunner for Best Ploggel, followed by the laxum, while the doffen is a long shot to win. Since these are the only contenders, if the laxum doesn\u2019t win Best Ploggel, then if the trendel doesn\u2019t win, the doffen will win. Moreover, the trendel likely will win Best Ploggel and hence the laxum likely won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trendel doesn\u2019t win Best Ploggel, the doffen will?",

            "content": "To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. There are three candidates for Best Ploggel: a trendel, a laxum, and a doffen.\n2. The trendel is considered the frontrunner, followed by the laxum, and the doffen is a long shot.\n3. If the laxum doesn't win, and the trendel doesn't win, then the doffen will win (since they are the only contenders).\n4. It is likely that the trendel will win, and hence it is likely that the laxum won't win.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Does it follow that it's likely that, if the trendel doesn't win Best Ploggel, the doffen will?\"\n\nTo determine this, we need to consider the likelihood of the trendel not winning. If the trendel doesn't win, then either the laxum or the doffen must win.\n\nHowever, we know that it is likely that the laxum won't win (because it is likely that the trendel will win).\n\nTherefore, if the trendel doesn't win, it is likely that the doffen will win, since the doffen is the only remaining candidate.\n\nAnswer: yes"
