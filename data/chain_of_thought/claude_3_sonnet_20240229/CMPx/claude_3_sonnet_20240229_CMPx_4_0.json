    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crinel, a nafiz, and a tomul are competing to be snarggle of next year's laggle team. The crinel is considered the frontrunner for snarggle, followed by the nafiz, while the tomul is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates, if the nafiz isn\u2019t named snarggle, then if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle. Moreover, the crinel likely will be named snarggle and hence the nafiz likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be?",

            "content": "To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. There are three candidates for the position of snarggle: a crinel, a nafiz, and a tomul.\n2. The crinel is considered the frontrunner, followed by the nafiz, while the tomul is a long shot.\n3. If the nafiz isn't named snarggle, and the crinel isn't named snarggle, then the tomul will be named snarggle.\n4. It is likely that the crinel will be named snarggle.\n5. If the crinel is named snarggle, then it is likely that the nafiz won't be named snarggle.\n\nNow, to answer the question: \"Does it follow that it is likely that, if the crinel isn't named snarggle, the tomul will be?\"\n\nGiven the information provided, we know that:\n- If the crinel isn't named snarggle, then either the nafiz or the tomul will be named snarggle.\n- It is likely that the crinel will be named snarggle.\n- If the crinel is named snarggle, then it is likely that the nafiz won't be named snarggle.\n\nHowever, the information does not explicitly state what happens if the crinel isn't named snarggle. It only states that if both the crinel and the nafiz aren't named snarggle, then the tomul will be named snarggle.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, it does not necessarily follow that it is likely that, if the crinel isn't named snarggle, the tomul will be.\n\nAnswer: no"
