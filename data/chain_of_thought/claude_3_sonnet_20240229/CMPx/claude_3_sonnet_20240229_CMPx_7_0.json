    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crastin, a nivet, and a jomial are the top bispets this breeding season. Breeders expect the crastin likely will birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, with the jomial birthing many fewer. These lead in birthing, so if the nivet doesn\u2019t birth the most offspring, then if the crastin doesn\u2019t, the jomial will. Moreover, the crastin likely will lead births and hence the nivet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the crastin doesn\u2019t lead births, the jomial will?",

If the nivet doesn't birth the most offspring, and the crastin doesn't either, then the jomial will.\n3. The crastin is likely to lead births, which means the nivet is unlikely to lead births.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where the crastin doesn't lead births.\n\n4. If the crastin doesn't lead births, it means either the nivet or the jomial led births.\n5. If the nivet led births, then it contradicts the premise that the crastin is likely to lead births.\n6. Therefore, if the crastin doesn't lead births, the only remaining possibility is that the jomial led births.\n\nAnswer: yes"
