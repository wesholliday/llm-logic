    "user_prompt": "Suppose a fantole, a dribban, and a snorpul have the best odds to win this season's Rizzle Cup. Oddsmakers believe it's most probable the fantole will capture the cup, followed by the dribban, while the snorpul is a heavy longshot. Since these are the only top contenders, if the dribban doesn\u2019t win the cup, then if the fantole doesn\u2019t win, the snorpul will win. Moreover, the fantole likely will win the cup and hence the dribban likely won't win. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantole doesn't win the Rizzle Cup, the snorpul will?",

            "content": "To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. There are three contenders for the Rizzle Cup: fantole, dribban, and snorpul.\n2. The fantole has the highest probability of winning, followed by the dribban, and the snorpul is a heavy longshot.\n3. If the dribban doesn't win, and the fantole doesn't win, then the snorpul will win (since they are the only contenders).\n4. It is likely that the fantole will win, and hence it is likely that the dribban won't win.\n5. The question asks if it follows that it's likely that, if the fantole doesn't win, the snorpul will win.\n\nTo determine this, we need to consider the probabilities involved.\n\nSince the fantole has the highest probability of winning, and it is likely that the fantole will win, the probability of the fantole not winning is relatively low.\n\nHowever, if the fantole doesn't win, then either the dribban or the snorpul must win. And since the dribban has a higher probability of winning than the snorpul, it is not necessarily likely that the snorpul will win if the fantole doesn't win.\n\nAnswer: no"
