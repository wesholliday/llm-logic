    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantole, a dribban, and a cruggit are the most downloaded fillip apps this month. Market watchers expect the fantole likely will retain the top spot in downloads, followed by the dribban, with the cruggit download rate significantly lower. These lead the downloads, so if the dribban isn\u2019t the most downloaded, then if the fantole isn\u2019t, the cruggit will be. Moreover, the fantole likely will lead downloads and hence the dribban likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fantole isn\u2019t the most downloaded, the cruggit will be?",

            "content": "To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. There are three fillip apps: fantole, dribban, and cruggit.\n2. Market watchers expect the fantole to be the most downloaded, followed by the dribban, with the cruggit having significantly lower downloads.\n3. It is stated that \"if the dribban isn't the most downloaded, then if the fantole isn't, the cruggit will be.\"\n4. It is also stated that \"the fantole likely will lead downloads and hence the dribban likely won't.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion: \"Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantole isn't the most downloaded, the cruggit will be?\"\n\nIf the fantole isn't the most downloaded, there are two possibilities:\na) The dribban is the most downloaded.\nb) The cruggit is the most downloaded.\n\nAccording to the given information, if the dribban isn't the most downloaded, and the fantole isn't the most downloaded, then the cruggit will be the most downloaded.\n\nHowever, the statement \"the fantole likely will lead downloads and hence the dribban likely won't\" suggests that it is more likely that the fantole will be the most downloaded, and the dribban will not be the most downloaded.\n\nTherefore, if the fantole isn't the most downloaded, it is more likely that the cruggit will be the most downloaded, as the dribban is expected to be the second most downloaded.\n\nAnswer: yes"
