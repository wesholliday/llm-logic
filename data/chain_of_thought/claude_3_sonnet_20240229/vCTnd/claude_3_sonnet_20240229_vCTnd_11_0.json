            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical form of the argument and check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nGiven:\nPremise: If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables.\nConclusion: If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the premise and conclusion.\nPremise: If P, then not Q.\nConclusion: If Q, then not P.\n\nStep 2: Check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\nThe premise states that if the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (not Q) must be true.\nThe conclusion states that if the consequent (Q) is true, then the antecedent (not P) must be true.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the logical relationship between the premise and conclusion.\nThe premise and conclusion are contrapositive statements. In propositional logic, if a conditional statement (If P, then Q) is true, then its contrapositive (If not Q, then not P) is also true.\n\nStep 4: Determine the validity of the argument.\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
