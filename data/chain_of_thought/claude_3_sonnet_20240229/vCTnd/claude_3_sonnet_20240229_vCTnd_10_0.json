The conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nTo illustrate this, consider a counterexample:\nLet A = \"It is raining\"\nLet B = \"The ground is wet\"\n\nPremise: A \u2192 \u00acB (If it is raining, then the ground is not wet)\nConclusion: B \u2192 \u00acA (If the ground is wet, then it is not raining)\n\nThe premise can be true (it's possible for it to rain without the ground getting wet, e.g., due to strong winds), but the conclusion is clearly false (the ground can be wet for reasons other than rain).\n\nAnswer: no"
