            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nGiven premise: If the room was tidied, then it was not tidied thoroughly.\nConclusion: If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied.\n\nStep 1: Represent the premise and conclusion using logical symbols.\nLet P = \"The room was tidied\"\nLet Q = \"The room was tidied thoroughly\"\n\nPremise: P \u2192 \u00acQ (If P is true, then Q is false)\nConclusion: Q \u2192 \u00acP (If Q is true, then P is false)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the form:\nPremise: P \u2192 \u00acQ\nConclusion: Q \u2192 \u00acP\n\nStep 3: Check if the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\nThe premise (P \u2192 \u00acQ) and the conclusion (Q \u2192 \u00acP) are not logically equivalent statements. In other words, the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nFor example, consider a scenario where the room was not tidied at all. In this case, both the premise (P \u2192 \u00acQ) and the conclusion (Q \u2192 \u00acP) would be true, but the conclusion does not follow logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no"
