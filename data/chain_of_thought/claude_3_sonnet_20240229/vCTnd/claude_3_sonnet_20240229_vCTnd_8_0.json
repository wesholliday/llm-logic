The premise states that if the issue was addressed, then it was not addressed effectively. However, the conclusion states the opposite: if the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed.\n\nThese two statements are not logically equivalent, and one cannot be derived from the other using the rules of logic.\n\nAnswer: no"
