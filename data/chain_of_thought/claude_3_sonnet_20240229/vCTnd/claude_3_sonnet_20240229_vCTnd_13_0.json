The premise and conclusion are not logically equivalent, and it is possible for the premise to be true while the conclusion is false.\n\nFor example, consider the following truth table:\n\np | q | p \u2192 \u00acq | q \u2192 \u00acp\n--+---+--------+--------\nT | T |   F    |   F\nT | F |   T    |   T\nF | T |   T    |   F\nF | F |   T    |   T\n\nAs you can see, when p is true and q is true (first row), the premise (p \u2192 \u00acq) is false, but the conclusion (q \u2192 \u00acp) is also false. This shows that the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no"
