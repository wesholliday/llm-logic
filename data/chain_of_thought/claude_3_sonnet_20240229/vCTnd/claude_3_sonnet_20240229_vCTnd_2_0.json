They express the same idea in different ways.\n\nIf we assume the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true, and vice versa. In other words, if \"Ann exercised\" implies \"she did not exercise strenuously,\" then it logically follows that \"if Ann exercised strenuously,\" then \"she did not exercise.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument form.\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premise, the given argument form is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
