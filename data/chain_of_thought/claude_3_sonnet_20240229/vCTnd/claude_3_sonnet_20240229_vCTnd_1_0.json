            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nGiven:\nPremise: If it's raining, then it's not raining hard.\nConclusion: If it's raining hard, then it's not raining.\n\nStep 1: Represent the premise and conclusion using logical symbols.\nLet 'R' represent \"it's raining,\" and 'H' represent \"it's raining hard.\"\nPremise: R \u2192 \u00acH (If it's raining, then it's not raining hard)\nConclusion: H \u2192 \u00acR (If it's raining hard, then it's not raining)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the logical form of the argument.\nThe premise and conclusion have the form of a conditional statement (if-then statement). The conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise.\n\nStep 3: Check if the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement.\nIn propositional logic, a conditional statement (p \u2192 q) is logically equivalent to its contrapositive (\u00acq \u2192 \u00acp).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion (H \u2192 \u00acR) is the contrapositive of the premise (R \u2192 \u00acH), and the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
