            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If A, then B (A \u2192 B)\nPremise 2: Not A (\u00acA)\nConclusion: Not B (\u00acB)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"Modus Tollens\" or \"Denying the Consequent.\"\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the validity of the argument form.\nThe form \"Modus Tollens\" is a valid argument form in classical logic. If the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the specific argument.\nThe first premise states: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\"\nThe second premise states: \"Alex did not finish the race.\"\nThe conclusion states: \"Chris did not finish the race.\"\n\nThis argument follows the valid form of \"Modus Tollens,\" where the first premise is a conditional statement, the second premise denies the consequent (Chris finished the race), and the conclusion denies the antecedent (Alex finished the race).\n\nAnswer: yes"
