            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nLet's represent the premises and conclusion using symbolic logic:\nP: \"The apple was red\"\nQ: \"The banana was yellow\"\n\nThe first premise is: \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q)\nThe second premise is: \"Not P\" (\u00acP)\nThe conclusion is: \"Not Q\" (\u00acQ)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the logical form using truth tables or rules of inference.\nWe can use a truth table to check if the argument form is valid:\n\nP | Q | P \u2192 Q | \u00acP | \u00acQ\n-----------------------\nT | T | T     | F  | F\nT | F | F     | F  | T\nF | T | T     | T  | F\nF | F | T     | T  | T\n\nThe truth table shows that when the premises (P \u2192 Q and \u00acP) are true, the conclusion (\u00acQ) is not necessarily true. This means the argument form is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the rules of inference for conditional statements:\n1. If P \u2192 Q is true, and P is true, then Q must be true (Modus Ponens).\n2. If P \u2192 Q is true, and Q is false, then P must be false (Modus Tollens).\n\nIn this argument, we have \u00acP (the second premise), which means P is false. However, we cannot infer anything about Q from the first premise (P \u2192 Q) when P is false. Therefore, the conclusion (\u00acQ) does not follow logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
