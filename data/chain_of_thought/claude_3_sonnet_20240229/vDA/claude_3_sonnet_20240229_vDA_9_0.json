            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the form:\nPremise 1: If A, then B (A \u2192 B)\nPremise 2: Not A (\u00acA)\nConclusion: Not B (\u00acB)\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid argument form in classical logic.\n\nStep 2: Check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\nIn Modus Tollens, if the first premise states that \"If A is true, then B is true\" (A \u2192 B), and the second premise states that \"B is false\" (\u00acB), then we can validly conclude that \"A is false\" (\u00acA).\n\nIn the given argument, the premises are:\nPremise 1: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt (A \u2192 B)\nPremise 2: Lisa did not buy the red shirt (\u00acA)\n\nFollowing the Modus Tollens form, if the first premise is true and the second premise is true, then the conclusion \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" (\u00acB) follows logically and necessarily.\n\nAnswer: yes"
