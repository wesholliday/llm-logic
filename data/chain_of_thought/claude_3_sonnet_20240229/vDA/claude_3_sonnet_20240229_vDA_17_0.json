            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, I need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This can be represented symbolically as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q is \"Kate ate salad.\"\n\nThe second premise is the negation of the antecedent (P) of the conditional statement: \"Ben did not eat pasta.\" This can be represented as \u00acP.\n\nThe conclusion is the negation of the consequent (Q) of the conditional statement: \"Kate did not eat salad.\" This can be represented as \u00acQ.\n\nThe logical form of the argument is:\nPremise 1: P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\nPremise 2: \u00acP (Not P)\nConclusion: \u00acQ (Not Q)\n\nThis form of argument is logically valid. It follows the logical rule known as \"Modus Tollens,\" which states that if the antecedent of a conditional statement is false (\u00acP), and the conditional statement itself is true (P \u2192 Q), then the consequent must be false (\u00acQ).\n\nIn other words, if the first premise is true (If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad), and the second premise is true (Ben did not eat pasta), then the conclusion (Kate did not eat salad) must necessarily follow.\n\nAnswer: yes"
