            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the form:\nPremise 1: If A, then B (If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball)\nPremise 2: Not A (Tom did not watch football)\nConclusion: Not B (Jen did not watch basketball)\n\nThis logical form is known as \"Modus Tollens\" or \"Denying the Consequent.\"\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the validity of the argument form.\nThe Modus Tollens argument form is logically valid. If the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nStep 3: Check if the premises are true or false.\nIn this case, we are not given any information about whether the premises are true or false. We are only asked to evaluate the logical validity of the argument form.\n\nSince the Modus Tollens argument form is logically valid, the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
