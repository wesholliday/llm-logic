            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nLet's represent the premises and conclusion using symbolic logic:\nP: \"The car was red\"\nQ: \"The truck was blue\"\n\nThe first premise is: \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q)\nThe second premise is: \"Not P\" (\u00acP)\nThe conclusion is: \"Not Q\" (\u00acQ)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the logical form using truth tables or rules of inference.\nWe can use a truth table to check if the argument form is valid:\n\nP | Q | P \u2192 Q | \u00acP | \u00acQ\n-----------------------\nT | T | T     | F  | F\nT | F | F     | F  | T\nF | T | T     | T  | F\nF | F | T     | T  | T\n\nIn the third row, when P is false (\u00acP is true) and Q is true, the conclusion \u00acQ is false. This means that the argument form is invalid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the rules of inference for conditional statements:\n1. If P \u2192 Q is true, and P is true, then Q must be true (Modus Ponens).\n2. If P \u2192 Q is true, and Q is false, then P must be false (Modus Tollens).\n\nIn this argument, we have \u00acP (the car was not red), and we want to conclude \u00acQ (the truck was not blue). However, the premises do not provide enough information to make this inference. The second premise (\u00acP) alone does not allow us to conclude \u00acQ based on the given conditional statement (P \u2192 Q).\n\nAnswer: no"
