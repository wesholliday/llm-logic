            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If A, then B (A \u2192 B)\nPremise 2: Not A (\u00acA)\nConclusion: Not B (\u00acB)\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid argument form in classical logic.\n\nStep 2: Check if the conclusion follows from the premises.\nIn Modus Tollens, if the first premise states that \"If A is true, then B is true\" (A \u2192 B), and the second premise states that \"B is false\" (\u00acB), then we can validly conclude that \"A is false\" (\u00acA).\n\nHowever, in the given argument, the premises are:\nPremise 1: If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter (A \u2192 B)\nPremise 2: The alien did not visit Mars (\u00acA)\nConclusion: The robot did not visit Jupiter (\u00acB)\n\nThis matches the valid form of Modus Tollens, where:\nA = \"The alien visited Mars\"\nB = \"The robot visited Jupiter\"\n\nSince the premises and conclusion follow the valid form of Modus Tollens, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
