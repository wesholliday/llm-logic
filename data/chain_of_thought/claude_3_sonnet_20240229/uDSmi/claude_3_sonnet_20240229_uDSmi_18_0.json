The first premise states: \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n   This is an OR statement, meaning one of the two options must be true.\n\n2. The second premise states: \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n   This negates one of the options from the first premise.\n\n3. If the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand, then according to the first premise, the only remaining option is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\n4. Since the second premise allows for the possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand, and the first premise states that in such a case, the notebook must be in the drawer, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
