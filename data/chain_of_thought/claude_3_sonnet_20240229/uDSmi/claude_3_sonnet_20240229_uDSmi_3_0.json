The first statement is: \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n   This is a disjunctive statement, meaning that at least one of the two options must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Also, the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n   This statement negates one of the options from the first statement.\n\n3. If the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, then according to the first statement, the only remaining option is that the keys are in the drawer.\n\n4. Since the second statement allows for the possibility that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, and the first statement says that in such a case, the keys must be in the drawer, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
