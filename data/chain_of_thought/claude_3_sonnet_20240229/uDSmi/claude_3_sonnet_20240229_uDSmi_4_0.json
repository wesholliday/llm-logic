Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom.\n2. The cat might not be playing in the bedroom.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\n\"Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom.\"\nThis is a disjunctive statement, which means that at least one of the two options must be true.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\n\"The cat might not be playing in the bedroom.\"\nThis statement introduces the possibility that the second option in the first statement is false.\n\nStep 3: Apply logical reasoning.\nIf the second option in the first statement (the cat playing in the bedroom) is false, then according to the disjunctive statement, the first option (the cat napping on the couch) must be true.\n\nTherefore, by combining the two statements, we can infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes"
