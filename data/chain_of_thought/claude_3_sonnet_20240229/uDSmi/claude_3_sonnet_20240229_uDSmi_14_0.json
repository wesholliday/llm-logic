Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\n2. The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\n\"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\"\nThis statement implies that the milk can only be in one of two locations: either on the counter or in the fridge.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\n\"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\"\nThis statement introduces the possibility that the milk is not in the fridge.\n\nStep 3: Combine the two statements using logical reasoning.\nIf the milk is not in the fridge (as stated in the second statement), and the first statement says that the milk must be either on the counter or in the fridge, then the only remaining possibility is that the milk is on the counter.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and logical reasoning, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes"
