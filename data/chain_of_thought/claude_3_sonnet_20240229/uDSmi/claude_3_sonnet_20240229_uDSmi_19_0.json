Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\n2. The watch might not be on his wrist.\n\nStep 1: Understand the first statement.\nThe first statement is a disjunctive statement, which means that at least one of the two options must be true: either the watch is charging on the dresser, or it must be on his wrist.\n\nStep 2: Understand the second statement.\nThe second statement suggests that the watch might not be on his wrist, which means that the second option in the first statement might not be true.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the implications.\nIf the watch is not on his wrist, then according to the first statement, the only remaining option is that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nStep 4: Draw the conclusion.\nSince the second statement implies that the watch might not be on his wrist, and the first statement states that either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes"
