The first statement is: \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n   This is a disjunctive statement, meaning that at least one of the two options must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Also, the cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\"\n   This statement introduces the possibility that the second option in the disjunctive statement might be false.\n\n3. If the second option (\"the cookies are hidden in the pantry\") is false, then according to the disjunctive statement, the first option (\"the cookies are in the jar\") must be true.\n\n4. Since the second statement allows for the possibility that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, and the disjunctive statement requires that at least one option must be true, we can infer that the cookies must be in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes"
