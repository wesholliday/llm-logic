Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\n2. The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\nThe first statement is a disjunctive statement, which means that at least one of the two options must be true: either the remote control is on the coffee table, or it is hiding under the couch.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\nThe second statement introduces the possibility that the remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\n\nStep 3: Combine the two statements.\nIf we combine the two statements, we can see that the second statement contradicts one of the options in the first statement (the remote control hiding under the couch).\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion.\nSince the second statement contradicts one of the options in the first statement, and the first statement is a disjunctive statement (at least one option must be true), the only remaining option is that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes"
