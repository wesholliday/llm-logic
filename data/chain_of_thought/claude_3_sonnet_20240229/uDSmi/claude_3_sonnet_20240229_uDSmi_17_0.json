The first statement is: \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack.\"\n   This is a disjunctive statement, meaning that at least one of the two options must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Also, the scarf might not be draped on the coat rack.\"\n   This statement introduces the possibility that the second option in the first statement is false.\n\n3. If the second option in the first statement is false (i.e., the scarf is not draped on the coat rack), then by the disjunctive nature of the first statement, the first option must be true (i.e., the scarf is stuffed in the backpack).\n\n4. Therefore, given the two statements, we can infer that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes"
