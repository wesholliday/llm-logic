Fido might not be in the garden.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\n\"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" means that one of the two options must be true: either Fido is inside, or Fido is in the garden.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\n\"Fido might not be in the garden\" means that it is possible for Fido to not be in the garden.\n\nStep 3: Combine the two statements.\nIf we combine the two statements, we can infer that if Fido is not in the garden (as stated in the second statement), then the only other option left from the first statement is that Fido must be inside.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can logically conclude that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes"
