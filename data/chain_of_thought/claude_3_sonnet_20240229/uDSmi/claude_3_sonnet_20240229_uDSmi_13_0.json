The first statement says: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the shelf.\"\n   This is a disjunctive statement, meaning one of the two options must be true.\n\n2. The second statement says: \"The toy might not be sitting on the shelf.\"\n   This negates one of the options from the first statement.\n\n3. If the toy is not sitting on the shelf, then according to the first statement, the only remaining option is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\n4. Since the second statement allows for the possibility that the toy is not on the shelf, and the first statement covers all possibilities, we can infer that if the toy is not on the shelf, it must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
