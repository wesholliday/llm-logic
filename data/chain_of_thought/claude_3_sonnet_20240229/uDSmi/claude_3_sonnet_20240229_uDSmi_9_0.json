Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor.\n2. The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\n\"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor.\"\nThis statement is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two options must be true.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\n\"The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor.\"\nThis statement suggests that the second option in the disjunction (the missing puzzle piece blending in on the floor) might be false.\n\nStep 3: Apply logical reasoning.\nIf the second option in the disjunction is false (the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor), then the first option must be true (the missing puzzle piece is in the box).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and logical reasoning, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
