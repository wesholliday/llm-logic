We have two statements:\n   a. \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk.\"\n   b. \"The pen might not be on my desk.\"\n\n2. The first statement is a disjunctive statement, meaning that at least one of the two options must be true (the pen is in the bag OR the pen is on the desk).\n\n3. The second statement suggests that the pen might not be on the desk, which means it's possible that the pen is not on the desk.\n\n4. If we combine these two statements, we can infer the following:\n   - If the pen is not on the desk (as suggested by the second statement), then according to the first statement, the only other option is that the pen must be in the bag.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we can logically conclude that if the pen is not on the desk, it must be in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
