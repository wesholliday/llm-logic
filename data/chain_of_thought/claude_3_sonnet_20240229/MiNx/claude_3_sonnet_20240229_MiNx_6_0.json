This implies that it's not the case that the grommet must have been sploffed.\n\nIn other words, if the negation of \"Grommet was sploffed\" is true, then the negation of \"Grommet must have been sploffed\" must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer \"It's not the case that the grommet must have been sploffed\" from the given statement \"The grommet might not have been sploffed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
