If it is possible that the zinger was not fraggled, then it cannot be necessary that the zinger was fraggled. In other words, if the first statement is true, the second statement must also be true.\n\n2. Conversely, if it is not the case that the zinger must have been fraggled, it does not necessarily imply that the zinger might not have been fraggled. The second statement being true does not guarantee the truth of the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the statement \"The zinger might not have been fraggled\" logically implies \"It's not the case that the zinger must have been fraggled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
