If the whiffle might not have been shanked (it is possible that it was not shanked), then it means that the whiffle is not necessarily shanked.\n2. In other words, if it is possible that the whiffle was not shanked, then it cannot be the case that the whiffle must have been shanked.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked\" from the given statement \"The whiffle might not have been shanked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
