The negation of this statement would be: \"The flob must have been skizzled.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer: \"It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled.\"\n\nThis statement is the negation of \"The flob must have been skizzled.\"\n\nSince the given statement (\"The flob might not have been skizzled\") implies the possibility that the flob was not skizzled, it also implies that it is not the case that the flob must have been skizzled.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer \"It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled\" from the given statement \"The flob might not have been skizzled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
