So, \u00acP means that \"the twonk was plinked\" is false.\n\nOn the other hand, \u00ac\u25a1P means that it is not necessary that \"the twonk was plinked\" is true.\n\nIn other words, if \u00acP is true (the twonk was not plinked), then \u00ac\u25a1P (it's not the case that the twonk must have been plinked) is also true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \u00ac\u25a1P from \u00acP.\n\nAnswer: yes"
