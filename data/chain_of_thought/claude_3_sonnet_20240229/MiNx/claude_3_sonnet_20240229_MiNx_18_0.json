            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical relationship between the given statement and the inference.\n\nThe given statement is: \"The shank might not have been plooked.\"\n\nThis statement can be broken down into two parts:\n1. \"The shank might not have been plooked\" = It is possible that the shank was not plooked.\n2. The negation of this statement would be: \"The shank must have been plooked.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the inference: \"It's not the case that the shank must have been plooked.\"\n\nThis inference is the negation of the second part mentioned above.\n\nIf the given statement is true, then its negation (\"The shank must have been plooked\") must be false.\n\nSince the inference is the negation of the negation of the given statement, it follows that the inference must be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statement \"The shank might not have been plooked,\" we can logically infer \"It's not the case that the shank must have been plooked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
