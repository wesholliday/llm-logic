This statement is equivalent to saying \"It is possible that the sneg was not crampled\".\n3. To infer \"It's not the case that the sneg must have been crampled\", we need to negate the statement \"The sneg must have been crampled\".\n4. The negation of \"The sneg must have been crampled\" is \"It is not the case that the sneg must have been crampled\".\n5. This negated statement is logically equivalent to \"It is possible that the sneg was not crampled\".\n6. Since the original statement \"The sneg might not have been crampled\" is equivalent to \"It is possible that the sneg was not crampled\", we can infer \"It's not the case that the sneg must have been crampled\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
