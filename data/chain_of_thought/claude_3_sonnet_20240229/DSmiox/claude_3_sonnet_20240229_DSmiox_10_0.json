'The wug might not be garpled' can be expressed as: ~(Garpled(wug))\n2. 'Either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled' can be expressed as: Sproinged(wug) \u2228 Garpled(wug)\n\nUsing the rules of logical inference, we can derive the following:\n\nPremise 1: ~(Garpled(wug))\nPremise 2: Sproinged(wug) \u2228 Garpled(wug)\n\nIf we assume ~(Garpled(wug)) is true (from Premise 1), then the only way for the disjunction in Premise 2 to be true is if Sproinged(wug) is true.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can logically infer:\n\nAnswer: yes"
