This means that the second possibility in Premise 2 (\"the fleeg must be surned\") is false.\n\nSince one of the possibilities in Premise 2 is false, the only remaining possibility is that \"the fleeg is bluttered\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can logically infer:\n\nAnswer: yes"
