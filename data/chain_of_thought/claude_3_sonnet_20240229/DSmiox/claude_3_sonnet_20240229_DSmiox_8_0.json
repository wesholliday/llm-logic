This means that it is possible for the sprocket to not be daggled.\n\n2) The second premise is \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled\". This is a disjunctive statement, meaning that at least one of the two options (cranked or daggled) must be true.\n\n3) Combining the two premises, we can reason as follows: If the sprocket is not daggled (as allowed by the first premise), then according to the second premise, it must be cranked.\n\n4) Therefore, from the given premises, we can logically infer that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
