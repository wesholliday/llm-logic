There are no other possibilities.\n\nNow, Premise 1 tells us that the glip might not be tragged. This means that the possibility of the glip being tragged is eliminated.\n\nSince the glip cannot be tragged (from Premise 1), and Premise 2 states that it must be either slogged or tragged, the only remaining possibility is that the glip is slogged.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can logically infer:\n\nAnswer: yes"
