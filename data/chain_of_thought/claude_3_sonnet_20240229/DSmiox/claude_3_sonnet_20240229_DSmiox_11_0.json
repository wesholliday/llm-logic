This means that it is possible for the flug to not be zimmed.\n\n2) The second premise is \"Either the flug is blummed or it must be zimmed\". This is a disjunctive statement, meaning that at least one of the two options (\"the flug is blummed\" or \"the flug must be zimmed\") must be true.\n\n3) Combining the two premises, we can see that if \"the flug must be zimmed\" is false (from the first premise), then the only remaining option from the second premise is \"the flug is blummed\".\n\n4) Therefore, from the given premises, we can logically infer that \"The flug is blummed\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
