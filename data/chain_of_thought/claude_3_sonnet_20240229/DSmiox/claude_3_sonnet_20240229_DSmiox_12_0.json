This means that it is possible for the smip to not be lupped.\n\n2) The second premise is \"Either the smip is shripped or it must be lupped\". This is a disjunctive statement, meaning that at least one of the two options (the smip is shripped or the smip must be lupped) must be true.\n\n3) Combining the two premises, we can infer that since the first premise allows for the possibility that the smip is not lupped, and the second premise states that if the smip is not lupped then it must be shripped, we can conclude that the smip is indeed shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes"
