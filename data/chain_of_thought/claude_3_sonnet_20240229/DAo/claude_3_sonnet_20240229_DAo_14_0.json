Therefore, according to the conditional statement \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den,\" we can infer that \"The wolf was not in the den\" (the negation of B).\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The given statement \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\"\n2. We know that \"The bear was not in the cave\" (the negation of A).\n3. According to the rule of denying the consequent, if we have \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is false, then we can infer that B is also false.\n4. Therefore, from \"The bear was not in the cave\" and \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den,\" we can infer \"The wolf was not in the den\" (the negation of B).\n\nAnswer: yes"
