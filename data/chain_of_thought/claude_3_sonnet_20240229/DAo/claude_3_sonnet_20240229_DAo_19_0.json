            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to use the rules of logic and conditional statements.\n\nGiven:\n- Premise 1: \"Tom did not watch football.\"\n- Premise 2: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"Jen did not watch basketball\" from these premises.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the second premise, which is a conditional statement.\nThe conditional statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" has two parts:\n- Antecedent (hypothesis): \"Tom watched football\"\n- Consequent (conclusion): \"Jen watched basketball\"\n\nStep 2: Apply the law of contrapositive.\nIf the antecedent (hypothesis) is false, we cannot make any conclusion about the consequent (conclusion). However, we can use the contrapositive of the conditional statement, which is logically equivalent.\n\nThe contrapositive of \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is:\n\"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nStep 3: Use the given premises and the contrapositive.\nFrom the first premise, \"Tom did not watch football,\" and the contrapositive, \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football,\" we cannot infer anything about whether Jen watched basketball or not.\n\nThe reason is that the first premise only tells us that the antecedent (Tom did not watch football) is true, but it does not provide any information about the consequent (Jen did not watch basketball).\n\nAnswer: no"
