A \u2192 B (If A is true, then B is true.)\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The robot did not visit Jupiter\" (\u00acB) from the given premises, we need to use the rules of logical inference.\n\nOne of the rules is the Modus Tollens rule, which states:\nIf (A \u2192 B) and (\u00acB), then (\u00acA).\n\nIn our case, we have:\n1. A \u2192 B (Premise 2)\n2. \u00acA (Premise 1)\n\nTherefore, using Modus Tollens, we can infer \u00acB, which means \"The robot did not visit Jupiter.\"\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. We are given that \"The alien did not visit Mars\" (\u00acA).\n2. We are also given that \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" (A \u2192 B).\n3. Using the Modus Tollens rule, if (A \u2192 B) and (\u00acA), then we can infer (\u00acB).\n4. Since we have (A \u2192 B) from premise 2 and (\u00acA) from premise 1, we can apply Modus Tollens.\n5. Therefore, we can infer (\u00acB), which means \"The robot did not visit Jupiter.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
