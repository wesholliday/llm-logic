If the contrapositive is false, then the second statement is not a valid inference.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the contrapositive.\n\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\"Erin did not take a train\" \u2192 \"Sam did not take a plane\"\n\nThis statement is logically equivalent to the second statement we want to evaluate: \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\"\n\nTherefore, the second statement is a valid inference from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
