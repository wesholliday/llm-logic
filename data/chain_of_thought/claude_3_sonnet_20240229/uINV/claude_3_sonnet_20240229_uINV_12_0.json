If the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nStep 4: Compare the contrapositive with the question.\nThe question asks: \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo?\"\n\nThis statement is the converse of the original statement, not the contrapositive.\n\nThe converse of a conditional statement is formed by interchanging the hypothesis and the conclusion, without negating either.\n\nConverse: If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park.\n\nStep 5: Determine if the converse is logically equivalent to the original statement.\nIn general, the converse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. It may or may not be true, depending on the specific context.\n\nAnswer: no"
