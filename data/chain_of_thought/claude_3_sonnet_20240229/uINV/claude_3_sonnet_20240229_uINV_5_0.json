This means that if Jeff did not play basketball (\u00acP), we cannot infer anything about whether Amy played tennis or not (Q or \u00acQ).\n\nStep 3: Determine the answer based on the analysis.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nWe cannot infer that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis. The negation of the antecedent does not necessarily imply the negation of the consequent in a conditional statement."
