            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical relationship between the given statement and the statement we want to infer.\n\nGiven statement: If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nThis statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"Alex finished the race,\" and B is \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the antecedent (the \"if\" part) and the consequent (the \"then\" part). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nStep 1: Negate the antecedent (A) and the consequent (B).\nNegation of A: \"Alex did not finish the race.\"\nNegation of B: \"Chris did not finish the race.\"\n\nStep 2: Swap the negated antecedent and consequent to form the contrapositive.\nContrapositive: If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\n\nStep 3: Compare the contrapositive with the statement we want to infer.\nStatement we want to infer: If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race.\n\nThe statement we want to infer is the same as the contrapositive of the given statement.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes"
