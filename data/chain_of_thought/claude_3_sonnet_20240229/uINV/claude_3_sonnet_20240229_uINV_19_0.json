            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical relationship between the given statements and determine if the contrapositive is valid.\n\nGiven statement: If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n\nStep 1: Represent the given statement symbolically.\nLet P = \"Tom watched football\"\nLet Q = \"Jen watched basketball\"\nThe given statement can be written as: P \u2192 Q (If P is true, then Q is true)\n\nStep 2: Find the contrapositive of the given statement.\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) is (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP), which means \"If Q is false, then P is false.\"\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be: If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the given statement.\nIn classical logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, if the given statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is true, then its contrapositive \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
