            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical relationship between the given statements and determine if the contrapositive is valid.\n\nGiven statement: If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\n\nStep 1: Identify the components of the given statement.\n- Premise (P): Ben ate pasta\n- Conclusion (Q): Kate ate salad\n\nStep 2: Negate the premise and the conclusion to form the contrapositive.\n- Contrapositive: If Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the validity of the contrapositive.\nThe contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement in a conditional statement (if P, then Q). If the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nStep 4: Determine if the contrapositive is valid in this case.\nIf we assume that the given statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" is true, then the contrapositive \"If Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta\" must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad.\n\nAnswer: yes"
