            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical relationship between the given statements and determine if the contrapositive is valid.\n\nGiven statement: If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n\nStep 1: Represent the given statement symbolically.\nLet A = \"The shirt was cotton\"\nLet B = \"The pants were denim\"\nThe given statement can be written as: If A, then B (A \u2192 B)\n\nStep 2: Find the contrapositive of the given statement.\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement (A \u2192 B) is (\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA), which means \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be: If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the contrapositive is logically valid.\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nTherefore, if the given statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is true, then its contrapositive \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
