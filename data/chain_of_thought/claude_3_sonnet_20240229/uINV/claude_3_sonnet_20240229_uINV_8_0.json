However, the statement we want to infer is the converse, which is \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\nThe converse of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\nIn our case, the converse would be: \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\"\n\nThe converse is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement. It may or may not be true, depending on the specific context.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nWe cannot infer that \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake\" from the given statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" The converse is not a valid logical inference from the original statement."
