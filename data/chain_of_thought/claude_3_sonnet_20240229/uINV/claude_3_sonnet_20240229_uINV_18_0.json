In other words, if the doll was not plastic, we cannot definitively conclude that the truck was not metal.\n\nStep 4: Consider the truth table for the conditional statement (P \u2192 Q).\n\nP | Q | P \u2192 Q\n-----------\nT | T | T\nT | F | F\nF | T | T\nF | F | T\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that when P is false (the doll was not plastic), the conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) is true regardless of the truth value of Q (the truck was metal or not).\n\nTherefore, the negation of the premise (\u00acP) does not provide enough information to determine the truth value of the conclusion (Q or \u00acQ).\n\nAnswer: no\n\nWe cannot infer that if the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal, based solely on the given conditional statement."
