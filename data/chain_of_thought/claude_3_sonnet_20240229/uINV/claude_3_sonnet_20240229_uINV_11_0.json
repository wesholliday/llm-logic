            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical relationship between the two statements: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" and \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\"\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the given statement.\nThe statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is an implication in the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the cake was chocolate,\" and B is \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nStep 2: Understand the logical relationship between the given statement and its contrapositive.\nThe contrapositive of an implication \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the contrapositive would be \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine if the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the given statement.\nIn classical logic, an implication and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if one is true, the other must also be true, and if one is false, the other must also be false.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the relationship between the given statement and the statement in question.\nThe statement in question, \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry,\" is the inverse of the given statement, not the contrapositive.\n\nStep 5: Determine if the inverse is logically equivalent to the given statement.\nIn classical logic, the inverse of an implication is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The truth or falsity of the inverse cannot be determined from the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nWe cannot infer that \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry\" from the given statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" The inverse of an implication is not logically equivalent to the original statement in classical logic."
