This does not necessarily imply that both conditions will occur simultaneously.\n\nTo infer \"The train might be late and crowded\", the statement should explicitly state or strongly suggest that both conditions (being late and being crowded) could happen together. The original statement does not provide enough information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
