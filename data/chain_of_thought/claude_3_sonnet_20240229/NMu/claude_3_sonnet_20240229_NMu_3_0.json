This statement is a negation of the statement \"The book must have been written by James.\"\n\n3. The negation of \"must\" is \"might not.\" So, the original statement can be rephrased as \"The book might not have been written by James.\"\n\n4. Therefore, we can infer \"The book might not have been written by James\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
