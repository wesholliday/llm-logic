This statement is a negation of \"The pen must be in my bag.\"\n3. The negation of a necessity statement implies possibility.\n4. So, \"It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag\" implies that \"The pen might not be in my bag\" is true.\n\nTherefore, the reasoning is valid, and we can infer \"The pen might not be in my bag\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
