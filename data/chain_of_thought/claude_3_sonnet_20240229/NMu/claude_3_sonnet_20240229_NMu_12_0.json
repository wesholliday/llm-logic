If the given statement is true, it means that the jacket being draped over the chair is not a necessity.\n2. This implies that there is a possibility that the jacket is not draped over the chair.\n3. Therefore, if the given statement is true, the proposed inference (\"The jacket might not be draped over the chair\") is also true.\n\nIn other words, the given statement logically implies the proposed inference.\n\nAnswer: yes"
