This statement is a negation of \"The shoes must be in the closet.\"\n3. The negation of a necessity statement implies possibility. In other words, if something is not necessary, then it is possible that it is not the case.\n4. Therefore, \"It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet\" implies that \"The shoes might not be in the closet\" is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes"
