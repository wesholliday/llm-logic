If it's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt, then it means that it is possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, which is the same as saying \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt.\"\n\nTherefore, the inference is valid and follows logically from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
