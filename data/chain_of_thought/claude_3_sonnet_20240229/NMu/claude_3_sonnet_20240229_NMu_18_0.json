This statement is a negation of the statement \"The notebook must be in the drawer.\"\n\n3. When we negate a statement with \"must,\" it implies that the opposite is possible. In this case, it means that the notebook does not necessarily have to be in the drawer.\n\n4. Therefore, the statement \"It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer\" implies that the notebook might not be in the drawer.\n\n5. The inference \"The notebook might not be in the drawer\" is a valid conclusion from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
