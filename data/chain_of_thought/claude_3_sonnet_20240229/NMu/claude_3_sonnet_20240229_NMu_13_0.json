            "content": "To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box.\"\n2. This statement is a negation of \"The toy must be in the toy box.\"\n3. The negation of a necessity statement implies possibility. In other words, if something is not necessarily true, then it is possible for it to be false.\n4. Therefore, \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\" implies that it is possible for the toy not to be in the toy box.\n5. The statement \"The toy might not be in the toy box\" expresses the same possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes"
