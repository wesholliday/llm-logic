In this case, the negation means that it is possible that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nThe inference we want to make is: \"Jeff might not have played basketball.\"\n\nThis inference is logically equivalent to the negation of the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"Jeff might not have played basketball\" from the given statement \"It's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
