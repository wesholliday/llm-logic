            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of logical deduction.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n2. \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\nThe statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\" This statement does not tell us whether A (Lisa bought the red shirt) or B (Mark bought the blue shirt) is true or false. It only states that if A is true, then B must also be true.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\nThe statement \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of logical deduction.\nIn propositional logic, affirming the consequent of a conditional statement does not allow us to deduce the truth of the antecedent. In other words, if we know \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is true, we cannot logically conclude that A is true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot logically deduce that \"Lisa bought the red shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
