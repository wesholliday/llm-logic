            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of deductive reasoning.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n2. \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the first statement.\nThe statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"Mary was at the wedding,\" and B is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the truth values of the given statements.\nThe second statement, \"Sue was at the wedding,\" affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of deductive reasoning.\nIn propositional logic, affirming the consequent of a conditional statement does not allow us to deduce the truth of the antecedent. In other words, from \"If A, then B\" and \"B is true,\" we cannot logically conclude that \"A is true.\"\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the conclusion.\nSince we cannot deduce the truth of the antecedent (\"Mary was at the wedding\") from the given statements, we cannot logically conclude that \"Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
