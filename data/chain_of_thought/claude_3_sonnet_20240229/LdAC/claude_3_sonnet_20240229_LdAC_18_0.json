In other words, if Q is true, it does not necessarily mean that P is also true.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the conclusion.\nFrom the given statements, we cannot logically deduce that \"The doll was plastic.\" The truth of the consequent (\"The truck was metal\") does not guarantee the truth of the antecedent (\"The doll was plastic\").\n\nAnswer: no"
