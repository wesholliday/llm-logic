This is because there could be other reasons or conditions that led to B being true, independent of A.\n\nIn other words, the truth of the consequent (B) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (A) in an if-then statement.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot logically deduce that \"The alien visited Mars\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
