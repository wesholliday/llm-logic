            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of logical deduction.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n2. \"The mummy was awake.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. It has the form:\nIf A (the vampire was awake), then B (the mummy was awake).\n\nThe second statement affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn classical logic, affirming the consequent of a conditional statement does not allow us to deduce the antecedent (A). In other words, from the given statements, we cannot logically conclude that \"The vampire was awake.\"\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The first statement establishes a sufficient condition for the mummy to be awake: if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n2. The second statement confirms that the mummy was awake.\n3. However, the mummy being awake could have other reasons besides the vampire being awake. The conditional statement does not rule out other possible causes for the mummy to be awake.\n4. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce that the vampire was awake based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
