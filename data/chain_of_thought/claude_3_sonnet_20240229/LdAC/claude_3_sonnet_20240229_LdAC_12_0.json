It has the form:\n\nIf A (antecedent), then B (consequent).\n\nIn this case, A is \"Joe went to the park,\" and B is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nThe second statement affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\nIf the antecedent (A) is true, and the conditional statement (If A, then B) is true, then the consequent (B) must be true. This is known as the \"modus ponens\" rule of inference.\n\nHowever, if we only know that the consequent (B) is true, we cannot logically deduce that the antecedent (A) is true. This is known as the \"fallacy of affirming the consequent,\" which is an invalid logical argument.\n\nIn our case, we know that \"Lucy went to the zoo\" (consequent B is true), but we cannot logically deduce that \"Joe went to the park\" (antecedent A is true) based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
