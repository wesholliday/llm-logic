In other words, from \"If A, then B\" and \"B is true,\" we cannot logically conclude that \"A is true.\"\n\nThis is because there could be other reasons or conditions that lead to B being true, independent of A being true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot logically deduce that \"The car was red.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
