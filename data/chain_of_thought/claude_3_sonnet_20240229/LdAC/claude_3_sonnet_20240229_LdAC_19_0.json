It states that if the condition \"Tom watched football\" is true, then the consequence \"Jen watched basketball\" must also be true.\n\nThe second statement directly affirms the consequence \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nIn propositional logic, the rule of modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, then we can logically deduce that Q is also true.\n\nIn this case, we have the conditional statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" and the premise \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nHowever, the premise \"Jen watched basketball\" alone is not sufficient to deduce that \"Tom watched football.\" The conditional statement only guarantees that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball, but it does not imply the converse (that if Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically deduce that \"Tom watched football.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
