There could be other reasons or conditions that lead to the consequent being true, besides the antecedent.\n\nIn other words, from the given premises, we cannot logically deduce that \"The book was written by James.\" The premises do not provide enough information to draw that conclusion with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no"
