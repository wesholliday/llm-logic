It states that if the antecedent (A) is true, then the consequent (C) must also be true. However, it does not provide any information about the truth value of A when C is true.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of logical deduction.\nIn propositional logic, there is no valid rule that allows us to deduce the truth of the antecedent (A) from the truth of the consequent (C) and the implication (A \u2192 C). This is known as the \"fallacy of affirming the consequent.\"\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot logically deduce that \"Alex finished the race\" (A) is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
