This means we assume q (Mary was at the wedding) is true.\nStep 2: From the second premise (q \u2192 p), if q is true, then p must also be true (Sue must have been at the wedding).\nStep 3: However, this contradicts the first premise (\u00acp), which states that it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\n\nSince we have arrived at a contradiction by assuming the premises are true and the conclusion is false, we can conclude that the argument is valid, and the conclusion (\u00acq) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
