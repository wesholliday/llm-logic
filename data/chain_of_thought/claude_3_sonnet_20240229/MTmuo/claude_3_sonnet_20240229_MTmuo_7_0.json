This means we assume A (Alex finished the race) is true.\nStep 2: From the second premise (A \u2192 C), if A is true, then C must be true.\nStep 3: However, the first premise (\u00acC) states that C is false.\nStep 4: We have reached a contradiction, as C cannot be both true and false at the same time.\nStep 5: Since we assumed the conclusion (\u00acA) is false and arrived at a contradiction, we can conclude that the assumption was incorrect.\nStep 6: Therefore, the only way to avoid the contradiction is if the conclusion (\u00acA) is true, which means \"Alex did not finish the race.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
