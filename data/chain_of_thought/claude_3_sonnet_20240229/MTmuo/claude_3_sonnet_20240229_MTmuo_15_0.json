If the antecedent (Sam took a plane) is true, then the consequent (Erin must have taken a train) must also be true.\n\nStep 3: Combine the contrapositive of the first premise with the second premise using the law of contrapositive.\nIf the consequent of the second premise is false (Erin did not take a train), then the antecedent (Sam took a plane) must also be false.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that \"Sam did not take a plane.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
