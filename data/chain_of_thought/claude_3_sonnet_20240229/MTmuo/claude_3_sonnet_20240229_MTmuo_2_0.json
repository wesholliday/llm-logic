(Premise 2)\nThe unicorn must have been in the forest. (Contrapositive of Premise 1)\nTherefore, the griffin was in the forest.\n\nStep 3: Negate the conclusion of the hypothetical syllogism to get the desired conclusion.\nNegation of \"The griffin was in the forest\" is \"The griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that \"The griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
