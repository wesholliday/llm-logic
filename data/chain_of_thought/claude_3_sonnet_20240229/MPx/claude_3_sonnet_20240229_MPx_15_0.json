It states that if the condition \"the dreb was vroombed\" is true, then the consequence \"the dreb was spened\" must also be true.\n\nThe second statement affirms the condition of the first statement, which is \"the dreb was vroombed.\"\n\nIn propositional logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, then we can infer that Q must also be true. This is known as the rule of modus ponens.\n\nIn our case, we have:\nP: \"The dreb was vroombed\" (which is true according to the second statement)\nQ: \"The dreb was spened\"\n\nSince we know that P is true and we have the conditional statement \"If P, then Q,\" we can apply modus ponens and conclude that Q must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
