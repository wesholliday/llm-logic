            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\"\n2. \"The sprocket was cranked.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. It has the form:\n\nIf A (antecedent), then B (consequent).\n\nIn this case, A is \"the sprocket was cranked,\" and B is \"the sprocket was daggled.\"\n\nThe second statement affirms the antecedent (A) of the conditional statement.\n\nAccording to the rules of inference, if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, then we can validly infer that B is also true. This is known as the \"modus ponens\" rule of inference.\n\nStep 1: Identify the conditional statement: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\"\nStep 2: Identify the affirmed antecedent: \"The sprocket was cranked.\"\nStep 3: Apply the modus ponens rule of inference.\n\nSince the antecedent \"the sprocket was cranked\" is true, and the conditional statement states that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent \"the sprocket was daggled\" must also be true, we can validly infer that the sprocket was daggled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
