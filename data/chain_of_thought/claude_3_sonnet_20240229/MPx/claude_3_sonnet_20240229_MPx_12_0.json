It states that if the condition \"the smip was shripped\" is true, then the consequence \"the smip lupped the zoint\" must also be true.\n\nThe second statement affirms that the condition \"the smip was shripped\" is true.\n\nIn propositional logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, then we can infer that Q must also be true. This is known as the rule of modus ponens.\n\nIn our case, we have:\nP: \"The smip was shripped\" (which is true)\nQ: \"The smip lupped the zoint\"\n\nSince P is true and we have the conditional statement \"If P, then Q,\" we can apply modus ponens and conclude that Q must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
