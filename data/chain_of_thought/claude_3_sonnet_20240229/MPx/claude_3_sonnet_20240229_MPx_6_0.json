It states that if the condition \"the grommet was sploffed\" is true, then the consequence \"the grommet plopped the frink\" must also be true.\n\nThe second statement affirms that the condition \"the grommet was sploffed\" is true.\n\nIn propositional logic, if the premise of a conditional statement is true, and the conditional statement itself is true, then we can infer that the consequence must also be true. This is known as the rule of modus ponens.\n\nIn this case, we have:\nPremise 1: \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\" (Conditional statement)\nPremise 2: \"The grommet was sploffed.\" (Affirming the condition)\n\nTherefore, by applying modus ponens, we can infer:\nConclusion: \"The grommet plopped the frink.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
