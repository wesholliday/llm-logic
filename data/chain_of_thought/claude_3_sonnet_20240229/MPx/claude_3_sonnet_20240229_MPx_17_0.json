It means that if the antecedent (A) is true, then the consequent (B) must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the antecedent is \"the flob was skizzled,\" and the consequent is \"the flob movated.\"\n\nGiven that Premise 2 states that the antecedent \"the flob was skizzled\" is true, and Premise 1 states the implication \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated,\" we can logically infer that the consequent \"the flob movated\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
