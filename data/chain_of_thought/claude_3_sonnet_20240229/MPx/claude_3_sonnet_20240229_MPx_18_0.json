The first statement establishes a conditional relationship: \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\"\n2. The second statement affirms the antecedent (A) of the conditional statement: \"The shank was plooked.\"\n3. Since the antecedent (A) is true, and the conditional statement (\"If A, then B\") is given as true, we can infer that the consequent (B) must also be true.\n4. Therefore, from the given statements, we can logically infer that \"The shank was nugged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
