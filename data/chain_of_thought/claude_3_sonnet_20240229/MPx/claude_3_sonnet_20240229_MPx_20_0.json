It states that if the condition \"the fleeg was bluttered\" is true, then the consequence \"it surned\" must also be true.\n\nThe second statement affirms that the condition \"the fleeg was bluttered\" is true.\n\nIn propositional logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, we can validly infer that Q is also true. This is known as the rule of modus ponens.\n\nStep 1: Identify the conditional statement: \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\"\nStep 2: Identify the affirmed condition: \"The fleeg was bluttered.\"\nStep 3: Apply the rule of modus ponens to infer the consequence.\n\nSince the condition \"the fleeg was bluttered\" is true, and the conditional statement states that if this condition is true, then \"it surned\" must also be true, we can validly infer that \"the fleeg surned\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
