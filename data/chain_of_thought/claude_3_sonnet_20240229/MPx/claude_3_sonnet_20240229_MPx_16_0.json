It states that if the condition \"the sneg was crampled\" is true, then the consequence \"the sneg sproted the frink\" must also be true.\n\nThe second statement affirms that the condition \"the sneg was crampled\" is true.\n\nIn propositional logic, if the premise of a conditional statement is true, and the conditional statement itself is true, then we can infer that the consequence must also be true. This is known as the rule of modus ponens.\n\nStep 1: Identify the premise and the conclusion of the conditional statement.\nPremise: \"The sneg was crampled.\"\nConclusion: \"The sneg sproted the frink.\"\n\nStep 2: Check if the premise is true.\nThe second statement affirms that \"The sneg was crampled\" is true.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rule of modus ponens.\nIf the premise is true, and the conditional statement is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The sneg sproted the frink\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
