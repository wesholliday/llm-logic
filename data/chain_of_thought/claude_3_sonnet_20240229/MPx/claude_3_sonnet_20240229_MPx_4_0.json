It has the form:\nIf A (the fribble was snurgled), then B (the fribble crinked).\n\nThe second statement affirms the antecedent (A) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn propositional logic, if the antecedent (A) of a conditional statement (If A, then B) is true, and the conditional statement itself is true, then we can infer that the consequent (B) must also be true.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n1. The antecedent (A): \"The fribble was snurgled\" is true (given).\n2. The conditional statement: \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\" is true (given).\n\nTherefore, we can apply the rule of inference known as \"Modus Ponens\" (or the \"Law of Detachment\") to conclude that the consequent (B) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
