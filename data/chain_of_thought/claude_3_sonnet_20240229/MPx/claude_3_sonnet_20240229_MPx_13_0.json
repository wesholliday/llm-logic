It has the form:\nIf A (the glip was slogged), then B (the glip was tragged).\n\nThe second statement affirms the antecedent (A) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn propositional logic, if the antecedent (A) of a conditional statement (If A, then B) is true, and the conditional statement itself is true, then we can infer that the consequent (B) must also be true.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n1. \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\" (Conditional statement)\n2. \"The glip was slogged.\" (Antecedent is true)\n\nTherefore, we can apply the rule of inference known as \"Modus Ponens\" or \"Affirming the Antecedent\" to conclude that the consequent must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
