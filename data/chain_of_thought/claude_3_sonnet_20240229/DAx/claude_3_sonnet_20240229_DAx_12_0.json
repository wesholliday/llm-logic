In other words, denying the antecedent does not allow us to infer the negation of the consequent.\n\nStep 4: Draw the conclusion.\nSince the second statement denies the antecedent (\"The smip was not shripped\"), we cannot infer the negation of the consequent (\"The smip did not lup the zoint\") based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
