The conclusion \"The splat did not quank\" does not necessarily follow.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If A, then B.\"\n2. The second statement negates the antecedent (A): \"Not A.\"\n3. When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the conditional statement as a whole is vacuously true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent (B).\n4. Therefore, from the given statements, we cannot determine the truth value of the consequent (B), which is \"the splat quanked.\"\n5. The conclusion \"The splat did not quank\" is not a valid inference from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
