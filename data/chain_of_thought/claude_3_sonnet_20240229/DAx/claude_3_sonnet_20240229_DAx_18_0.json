The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If A, then B.\"\n2. The second statement negates the antecedent (A): \"Not A.\"\n3. When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the conditional statement as a whole is true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent.\n4. Therefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer the truth or falsity of the consequent (B).\n\nAnswer: no"
