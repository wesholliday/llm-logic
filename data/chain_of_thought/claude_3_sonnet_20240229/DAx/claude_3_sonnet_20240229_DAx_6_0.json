The consequent (B) could be either true or false.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If A, then B.\"\n2. The second statement negates the antecedent (A): \"Not A.\"\n3. When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the conditional statement as a whole is vacuously true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent (B).\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the truth value of the consequent (B) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
