The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated.\"\n2. The second statement negates the antecedent: \"The flob was not skizzled.\"\n3. When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the conditional statement is vacuously true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the truth value of the consequent, \"The flob was not movated,\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
