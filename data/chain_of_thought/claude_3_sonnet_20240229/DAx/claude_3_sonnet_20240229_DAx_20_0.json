The truth value of the consequent (B) remains unknown.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\"\n2. The second statement negates the antecedent: \"The fleeg was not bluttered.\"\n3. When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the conditional statement as a whole is true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the truth value of the consequent (\"The fleeg did not surn\") from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
