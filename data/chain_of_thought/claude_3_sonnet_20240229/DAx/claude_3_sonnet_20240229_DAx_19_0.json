This is known as the law of material implication or the principle of truth functionality.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer anything about whether \"the smonk was not plagged\" or \"the smonk plagged.\" The truth value of the consequent remains unknown.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If A, then B.\"\n2. The second statement negates the antecedent (A): \"Not A.\"\n3. When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the conditional statement as a whole is true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent (B or not B).\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the truth value of the consequent (B or not B) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
