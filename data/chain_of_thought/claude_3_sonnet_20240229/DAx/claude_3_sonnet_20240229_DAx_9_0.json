The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\"\n2. The second statement negates the antecedent: \"The twonk was not plinked.\"\n3. When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the conditional statement as a whole is true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the truth value of the consequent (\"it was varnished\") or its negation (\"it was not varnished\").\n\nAnswer: no"
