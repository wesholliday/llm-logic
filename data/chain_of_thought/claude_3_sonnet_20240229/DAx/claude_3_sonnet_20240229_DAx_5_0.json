This is because the truth of the conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) is vacuously true when the antecedent (P) is false, regardless of the truth value of the consequent (Q).\n\nIn other words, if the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the conditional statement itself is true, regardless of whether the consequent is true or false.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nWe cannot infer \"The zinger was not smoogled\" from the given statements."
