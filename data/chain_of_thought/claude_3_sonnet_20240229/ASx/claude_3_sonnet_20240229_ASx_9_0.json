The second statement adds an additional condition (zooned) to the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the conditional.\n\nTo infer the second statement from the first, we would need an additional premise that establishes a logical connection between \"blorped\" and \"zooned\" for the ploofle.\n\nWithout any additional information or premises, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
