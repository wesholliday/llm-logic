            "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have two premises:\n   a. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\n   b. It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\n\n2. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If A, then B\", where A is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and B is \"Sue must have been at the wedding\".\n\n3. The second premise negates B: \"It's not the case that B\".\n\n4. In logic, if we have \"If A, then B\" and \"Not B\", we can infer \"Not A\".\n\n5. Applying this to our problem:\n   a. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\"\n   b. \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\"\n   c. Therefore, we can infer that \"Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
