It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\n\"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\"\nThis is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Sue chose pizza) is true, then the consequent (Bob must have chosen pasta) must also be true.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\n\"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.\"\nThis statement negates the consequent of the first statement.\n\nStep 3: Use logical reasoning.\nIf the consequent (Bob must have chosen pasta) is false, then according to the first statement, the antecedent (Sue chose pizza) must also be false.\n\nIn other words, if Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue could not have chosen pizza.\n\nStep 4: Draw the conclusion.\nSince the second statement negates the consequent of the first statement, we can infer that the antecedent (Sue chose pizza) is false.\n\nAnswer: yes"
