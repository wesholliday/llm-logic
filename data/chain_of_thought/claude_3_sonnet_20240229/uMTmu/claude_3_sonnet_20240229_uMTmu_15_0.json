It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\nIf Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\nThis is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Sam took a plane) is true, then the consequent (Erin must have taken a train) must also be true.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\nIt's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\nThis statement negates the consequent of the first statement.\n\nStep 3: Use logical reasoning to draw a conclusion.\nIf the consequent (Erin must have taken a train) is false, then according to the first statement, the antecedent (Sam took a plane) must also be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes"
