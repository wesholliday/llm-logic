If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n2. It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nStep 1: Represent the statements using propositional logic.\nLet p = \"Lisa bought the red shirt\"\nLet q = \"Mark bought the blue shirt\"\n\nThe first statement can be represented as: p \u2192 q (If p is true, then q must be true)\nThe second statement can be represented as: \u00acq (q is false)\n\nStep 2: Use the rules of logical inference to derive the conclusion.\nWe know that \u00acq (Mark did not buy the blue shirt) is true.\nFrom the first statement, p \u2192 q, we can infer that if q is false (\u00acq), then p must be false (\u00acp).\n\nThis is based on the logical principle of contrapositive: If p \u2192 q is true, then \u00acq \u2192 \u00acp is also true.\n\nTherefore, if Mark did not buy the blue shirt (\u00acq), then Lisa did not buy the red shirt (\u00acp).\n\nAnswer: yes"
