If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n2. It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nStep 1: Represent the statements using propositional logic.\nLet P = \"Joe went to the park\"\nLet Q = \"Lucy went to the zoo\"\n\nThe first statement can be represented as: P \u2192 Q (If P is true, then Q must be true)\nThe second statement can be represented as: \u00acQ (Q is false)\n\nStep 2: Use the rules of logical inference to derive the conclusion.\nFrom the second statement, \u00acQ (Q is false), we can infer that the antecedent (P) of the first statement (P \u2192 Q) must be false.\n\nThis is because if P were true, then Q would have to be true according to the first statement (P \u2192 Q). However, we know that Q is false (\u00acQ), which contradicts the first statement.\n\nTherefore, to avoid a contradiction, P must be false, which means \"Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
