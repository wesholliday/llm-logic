If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\n2. It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\n\nStep 1: Represent the statements using propositional logic.\nLet p = \"The doll was plastic\"\nLet q = \"The truck must have been metal\"\n\nThe first statement can be represented as: p \u2192 q (If p is true, then q must be true)\nThe second statement can be represented as: \u00acq (q is false)\n\nStep 2: Use the rules of logical inference to derive a conclusion.\nFrom the second statement (\u00acq), we know that q is false.\nIf we assume p is true (the doll was plastic), then according to the first statement (p \u2192 q), q must be true (the truck must have been metal).\nHowever, this contradicts the second statement (\u00acq), which states that q is false.\n\nTherefore, the only way to avoid this contradiction is if p is false, meaning the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes"
