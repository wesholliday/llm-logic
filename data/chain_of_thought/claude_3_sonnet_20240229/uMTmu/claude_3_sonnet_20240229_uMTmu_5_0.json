If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\n2. It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\n\nStep 1: Represent the statements using propositional logic.\nLet p = \"Jeff played basketball\"\nLet q = \"Amy must have played tennis\"\n\nThe first statement can be represented as: p \u2192 q (If p is true, then q must be true)\nThe second statement can be represented as: \u00acq (q is false)\n\nStep 2: Use the rules of logical inference to derive the conclusion.\nWe know that \u00acq (Amy must not have played tennis) is true.\nFrom the first statement, p \u2192 q (If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis), we can infer that if q is false (\u00acq), then p must be false (\u00acp).\n\nThis is based on the logical principle of contrapositive: If p \u2192 q is true, then \u00acq \u2192 \u00acp is also true.\n\nStep 3: Conclude the answer.\nSince we have derived that \u00acp (Jeff did not play basketball) is true, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes"
