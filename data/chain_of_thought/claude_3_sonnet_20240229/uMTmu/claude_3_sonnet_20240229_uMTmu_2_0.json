            "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have two premises:\n   a. If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\n   b. It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\n\n2. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If A, then B\", where A is \"the griffin was in the forest\" and B is \"the unicorn must have been in the forest\".\n\n3. The second premise negates B: \"It's not the case that B\".\n\n4. In logic, if we have \"If A, then B\" and \"Not B\", we can conclude \"Not A\" using the rule of Modus Tollens.\n\n5. Therefore, from the given premises, we can infer that \"Not A\", which means \"the griffin was not in the forest\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
