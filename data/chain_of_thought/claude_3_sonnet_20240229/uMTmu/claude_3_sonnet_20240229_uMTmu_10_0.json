If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\n2. It's not the case that the cat must have been outside.\n\nStep 1: Understand the first statement.\n\"If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\"\nThis is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the dog was inside) is true, then the consequent (the cat must have been outside) must also be true.\n\nStep 2: Understand the second statement.\n\"It's not the case that the cat must have been outside.\"\nThis statement negates the consequent of the first statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply logical reasoning.\nIf the first statement is true, and the second statement negates the consequent of the first statement, then the antecedent of the first statement must be false.\n\nIn other words, if \"the cat must have been outside\" is false, then \"the dog was inside\" must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes\n\nWe can infer that the dog was not inside because the second statement contradicts the consequent of the first statement, which means the antecedent (the dog was inside) must be false."
