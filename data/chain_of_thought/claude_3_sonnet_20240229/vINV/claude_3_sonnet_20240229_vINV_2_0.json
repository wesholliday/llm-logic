            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nStep 1: Identify the premise and conclusion.\nPremise: If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\nConclusion: If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nStep 2: Represent the premise and conclusion using logical symbols.\nLet p = \"The griffin was in the forest\"\nLet q = \"The unicorn was in the forest\"\n\nPremise: p \u2192 q (If p, then q)\nConclusion: \u00acp \u2192 \u00acq (If not p, then not q)\n\nStep 3: Analyze the logical form of the argument.\nThe premise is a conditional statement (p \u2192 q), and the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise (\u00acq \u2192 \u00acp).\n\nIn propositional logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if the premise is true, then the contrapositive conclusion must also be true.\n\nStep 4: Determine the validity of the argument.\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
