            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical form of the argument and check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nGiven:\nPremise: If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\nConclusion: If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\n\nStep 1: Represent the premise and conclusion using logical symbols.\nLet P = \"The car was red\"\nLet Q = \"The truck was blue\"\n\nPremise: P \u2192 Q (If P is true, then Q is true)\nConclusion: \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ (If not P is true, then not Q is true)\n\nStep 2: Check if the argument form is logically valid by considering all possible truth value combinations of P and Q.\n\nThere are four possible truth value combinations:\n\n1. P is true, Q is true: In this case, the premise (P \u2192 Q) is true, and the conclusion (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ) is also true.\n2. P is true, Q is false: In this case, the premise (P \u2192 Q) is false, and the conclusion (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ) is true.\n3. P is false, Q is true: In this case, the premise (P \u2192 Q) is true, and the conclusion (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ) is true.\n4. P is false, Q is false: In this case, the premise (P \u2192 Q) is true, and the conclusion (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ) is true.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the results.\nIn all four cases, whenever the premise is true, the conclusion is also true. This means that the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise, and the argument form is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
