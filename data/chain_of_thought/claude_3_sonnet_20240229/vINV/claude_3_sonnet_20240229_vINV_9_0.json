            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nGiven premise: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\nConclusion: If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nStep 1: Represent the premise and conclusion using symbolic logic.\nLet P = \"Lisa bought the red shirt\"\nLet Q = \"Mark bought the blue shirt\"\n\nPremise: P \u2192 Q (If P is true, then Q is true)\nConclusion: \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ (If not P is true, then not Q is true)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the logical form of the argument.\nThe premise is a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q), and the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP).\n\nStep 3: Check if the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement.\nIn propositional logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if the premise is true, then the contrapositive conclusion must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
