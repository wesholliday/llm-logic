            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nGiven premise: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\nSymbolically: M \u2192 S\n\nThe conclusion is: If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\nSymbolically: ~M \u2192 ~S\n\nThis argument form is an example of contrapositive, which is a logically valid form of argument.\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If ~Q, then ~P\".\n\nIn this case, the premise \"If M, then S\" is equivalent to \"If ~S, then ~M\" by the contrapositive rule.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"If ~M, then ~S\" follows logically from the premise.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1) The premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n2) The contrapositive of this premise is: If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\n3) The conclusion states: If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\n4) The conclusion is the same as the contrapositive of the premise.\n5) Since the contrapositive is a logically valid form of argument, the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes"
