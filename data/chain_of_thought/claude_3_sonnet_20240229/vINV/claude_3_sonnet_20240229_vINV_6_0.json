            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nGiven premise: If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\nConclusion: If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nStep 1: Represent the premise and conclusion using symbolic logic.\nLet P = \"Sue chose pizza\"\nLet Q = \"Bob chose pasta\"\n\nPremise: P \u2192 Q (If P is true, then Q is true)\nConclusion: \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ (If not P is true, then not Q is true)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the logical form of the argument.\nThe premise and conclusion are related by the contrapositive rule in logic, which states that if P \u2192 Q is true, then \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP is also true.\n\nStep 3: Check if the contrapositive of the premise implies the conclusion.\nThe contrapositive of the premise (P \u2192 Q) is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP.\nIf we assume the contrapositive (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP) is true, then the conclusion (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows from the premise by the contrapositive rule.\n\nAnswer: yes"
