            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the premise and conclusion.\nPremise: If P, then Q (If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad)\nConclusion: If not P, then not Q (If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad)\n\nStep 2: Check if the logical form of the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise.\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nIn this case, the conclusion \"If not P, then not Q\" is indeed the contrapositive of the premise \"If P, then Q.\"\n\nStep 3: In propositional logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
