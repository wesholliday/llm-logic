This form is known as the \"Contrapositive\" rule, which states that if the conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) is true, then its contrapositive (~Q \u2192 ~P) is also true.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise according to the rules of propositional logic.\n\nAnswer: yes"
