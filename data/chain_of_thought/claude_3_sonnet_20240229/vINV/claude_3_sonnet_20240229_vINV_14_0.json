            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nGiven premise: If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\nConclusion: If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.\n\nStep 1: Represent the premise and conclusion using logical symbols.\nLet A = \"The bear was in the cave\"\nLet B = \"The wolf was in the den\"\n\nPremise: A \u2192 B (If A is true, then B is true)\nConclusion: \u00acA \u2192 \u00acB (If not A is true, then not B is true)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the logical form of the argument.\nThe premise is a conditional statement (A \u2192 B), and the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise (\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA).\n\nStep 3: Check if the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement.\nIn propositional logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true, making the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
