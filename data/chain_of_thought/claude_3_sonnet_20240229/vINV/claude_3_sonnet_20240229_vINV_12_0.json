            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nGiven premise: If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\nConclusion: If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nStep 1: Represent the premise and conclusion using logical symbols.\nLet P = \"Joe went to the park\"\nLet Q = \"Lucy went to the zoo\"\n\nPremise: P \u2192 Q (If P is true, then Q is true)\nConclusion: \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ (If not P is true, then not Q is true)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the logical form of the argument.\nThe premise is a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q), and the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP).\n\nStep 3: Check if the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement.\nIn propositional logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the premise is true, then the conclusion (which is the contrapositive) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
