            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nGiven premise: If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\nConclusion: If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nStep 1: Represent the premise and conclusion using symbolic logic.\nLet p = \"Tom watched football\"\nLet q = \"Jen watched basketball\"\n\nPremise: p \u2192 q (If p is true, then q is true)\nConclusion: \u00acp \u2192 \u00acq (If not p is true, then not q is true)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the logical form of the argument.\nThe premise is a conditional statement (p \u2192 q), and the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise (\u00acq \u2192 \u00acp).\n\nStep 3: Check if the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement.\nIn propositional logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
