            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nThe premise is: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\"\nThis is a conditional statement of the form: \"If A, then B.\"\n\nThe conclusion is: \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\"\nThis is the contrapositive of the premise, which has the form: \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nIn propositional logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if the premise is true, then the contrapositive conclusion must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
