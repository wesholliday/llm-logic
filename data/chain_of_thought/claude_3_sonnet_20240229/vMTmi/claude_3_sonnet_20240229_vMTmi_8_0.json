            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nGiven premises:\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\n2. The mummy might not have been awake.\n\nConclusion:\nThe vampire was not awake.\n\nStep 1: Represent the premises and conclusion using symbolic logic.\nLet V = \"The vampire was awake\"\nLet M = \"The mummy was awake\"\n\nPremise 1: V \u2192 M (If V is true, then M must be true)\nPremise 2: \u00acM (M is false, or the mummy might not have been awake)\n\nConclusion: \u00acV (V is false, or the vampire was not awake)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the form:\nPremise 1: V \u2192 M\nPremise 2: \u00acM\nConclusion: \u00acV\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"Modus Tollens,\" which is a valid argument form in classical logic.\n\nStep 3: Verify the validity of the argument using truth tables or logical rules.\nUsing truth tables, we can verify that the conclusion (\u00acV) follows necessarily from the premises (V \u2192 M and \u00acM).\n\nV | M | V \u2192 M | \u00acM | \u00acV\n-----------------------\nT | T | T     | F  | F\nT | F | F     | T  | F\nF | T | T     | F  | T\nF | F | T     | T  | T\n\nAs shown in the truth table, whenever the premises (V \u2192 M and \u00acM) are true, the conclusion (\u00acV) is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
