In other words, denying the consequent does not allow us to infer the negation of the antecedent.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the conclusion.\nThe conclusion we want to evaluate is \"The bear was not in the cave.\"\nThis conclusion is the negation of the antecedent (A) in the conditional statement from step 1.\n\nSince we cannot infer the negation of the antecedent from denying the consequent, we cannot conclude that \"The bear was not in the cave\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
