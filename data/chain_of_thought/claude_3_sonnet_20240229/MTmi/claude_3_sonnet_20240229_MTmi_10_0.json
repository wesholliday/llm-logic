However, if the consequent (q) is false, we cannot make any definite conclusion about the antecedent (p).\n\nThe second statement (\u00acq) directly contradicts the consequent (q) of the first statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of logical inference.\nIf we assume that the second statement (\u00acq) is true, then the consequent (q) of the first statement (p \u2192 q) must be false.\n\nHowever, the falsity of the consequent (q) does not necessarily imply the falsity of the antecedent (p) in a conditional statement (p \u2192 q). In other words, if q is false, we cannot definitively conclude whether p is true or false.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The dog was not inside.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
