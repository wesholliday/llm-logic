However, if the consequent (q) is false, we cannot make any definite conclusion about the antecedent (p).\n\nThe second statement (\u00acq) directly contradicts the consequent (q) of the first statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of logical inference.\nIf we assume that the second statement (\u00acq) is true, then it contradicts the consequent (q) of the first statement (p \u2192 q). This means that the antecedent (p) of the first statement must be false.\n\nTherefore, if \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt\" (\u00acq) is true, then we can infer that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" (\u00acp) is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
