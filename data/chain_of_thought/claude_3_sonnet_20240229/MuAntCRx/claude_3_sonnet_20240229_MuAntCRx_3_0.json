            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the second statement can be inferred from the first, I need to analyze the logical structure and meaning of the statements. The first statement \"The wobble must frozz fizzle\" establishes that some subject (\"The wobble\") is required to perform two actions (\"frozz\" and \"fizzle\"). The second statement adds two additional actions (\"fribble quorple\") that the subject must perform, in addition to the original two actions.\n\nSince the second statement includes all the requirements of the first statement, plus additional requirements, it cannot be strictly inferred from the first statement alone. The first statement does not provide enough information to conclude that the subject must also \"fribble quorple\" in addition to \"frozz fizzle\".\n\nAnswer: no"
