This statement does not mention anything about the plonk wump.\n\nThe second statement introduces an additional condition, which is that the glorp must be in the plonk wump, in addition to being in the flibbit blimp.\n\nSince the original statement does not provide any information about the plonk wump, we cannot logically infer that the glorp must also be in the plonk wump. The second statement adds a new condition that is not supported by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
