The original statement only mentions that the zibble must perform the action of 'glorping' on a 'flonk'. It does not mention anything about 'groobling' a 'quazzle'. To infer the second statement from the first, we would need additional information or context indicating that the zibble must perform both actions of 'groobling' a 'quazzle' and 'glorping' a 'flonk'.\n\nAnswer: no"
