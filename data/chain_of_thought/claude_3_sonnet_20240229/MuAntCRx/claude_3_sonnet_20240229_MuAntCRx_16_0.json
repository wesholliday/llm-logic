            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The grooble must frazzle quibble wibble' does not provide enough information to logically infer the longer statement 'The grooble must snork wozzle grooble and frazzle quibble wibble'. The longer statement introduces new terms ('snork', 'wozzle') and an additional clause ('and frazzle quibble wibble') that are not present or implied in the original statement. Without additional context or information, we cannot make the logical leap to the longer, more complex statement based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
