            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nGiven premises:\n1. If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\n2. It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad.\n\nConclusion:\nBen did not eat pasta.\n\nStep 1: Represent the premises symbolically.\nLet P = \"Ben ate pasta\"\nLet Q = \"Kate must have eaten salad\"\n\nPremise 1: P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\nPremise 2: \u00acQ (Not Q)\n\nStep 2: Apply the rules of logic to the premises.\nFrom premise 1 (P \u2192 Q) and premise 2 (\u00acQ), we can use the modus tollens rule, which states:\nIf (P \u2192 Q) and (\u00acQ), then (\u00acP).\n\nStep 3: Derive the conclusion from the premises.\nUsing modus tollens:\nIf (P \u2192 Q) and (\u00acQ), then (\u00acP)\nSubstituting the symbolic representations:\nIf (P \u2192 Q) and (\u00acQ), then (\u00acP)\nIf (\"Ben ate pasta\" \u2192 \"Kate must have eaten salad\") and (It's not the case that \"Kate must have eaten salad\"), then (Ben did not eat pasta)\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Ben did not eat pasta\" follows logically from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
