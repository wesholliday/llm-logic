            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nGiven premises:\n1. If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n2. It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\n\nConclusion:\nSam did not take a plane.\n\nStep 1: Represent the premises and conclusion using symbolic logic.\nLet P = \"Sam took a plane\"\nLet Q = \"Erin must have taken a train\"\n\nPremise 1: P \u2192 Q (If P is true, then Q must be true)\nPremise 2: \u00acQ (Q is false)\n\nConclusion: \u00acP (P is false)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the form:\nP \u2192 Q\n\u00acQ\n\u2234 \u00acP\n\nThis form is known as \"Modus Tollens,\" which is a valid argument form in classical logic.\n\nStep 3: Check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\nIf the first premise (P \u2192 Q) is true, and the second premise (\u00acQ) is true, then the conclusion (\u00acP) must be true.\n\nIn other words, if \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train\" is true, and \"It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train\" is true, then it logically follows that \"Sam did not take a plane\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
