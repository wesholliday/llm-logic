            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nGiven premises:\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\n2. It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\n\nConclusion:\nThe vampire was not awake.\n\nStep 1: Represent the premises and conclusion using symbolic logic.\nLet p = \"The vampire was awake\"\nLet q = \"The mummy must have been awake\"\n\nPremise 1: p \u2192 q (If p, then q)\nPremise 2: \u00acq (Not q)\nConclusion: \u00acp (Not p)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the form:\nPremise 1: p \u2192 q\nPremise 2: \u00acq\nConclusion: \u00acp\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"Modus Tollens,\" which is a valid argument form in classical logic.\n\nStep 3: Verify the validity using a truth table or logical reasoning.\nUsing a truth table, we can verify that the conclusion (\u00acp) must be true whenever the premises (p \u2192 q and \u00acq) are true.\n\nStep 4: Determine the validity of the argument.\nSince the argument follows the valid form of Modus Tollens, and the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
