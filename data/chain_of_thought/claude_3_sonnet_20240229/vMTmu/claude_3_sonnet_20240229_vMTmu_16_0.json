            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nGiven premises:\n1. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\n2. It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\n\nConclusion:\nThe shirt was not cotton.\n\nStep 1: Represent the premises symbolically.\nLet p = \"The shirt was cotton\"\nLet q = \"The pants must have been denim\"\n\nPremise 1: p \u2192 q (If p, then q)\nPremise 2: \u00acq (Not q)\n\nStep 2: Apply the rules of logic to the premises.\nUsing the law of contrapositive:\nIf (p \u2192 q) is true, then (\u00acq \u2192 \u00acp) is also true.\n\nSubstituting the premises:\n(\u00acq \u2192 \u00acp) is true\n\nStep 3: Check if the conclusion follows from the premises.\nThe conclusion is \"The shirt was not cotton,\" which is represented as \u00acp.\nFrom the premises, we have derived (\u00acq \u2192 \u00acp), which means \"If not q, then not p.\"\nSince premise 2 states \u00acq (It's not the case that the pants must have been denim), we can conclude \u00acp (The shirt was not cotton).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
