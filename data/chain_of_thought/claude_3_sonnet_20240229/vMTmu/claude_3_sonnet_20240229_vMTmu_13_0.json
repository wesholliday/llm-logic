If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\n2. It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\n\nConclusion:\nThe car was not red.\n\nStep 1: Represent the premises and conclusion using symbolic logic.\nLet p = \"The car was red\"\nLet q = \"The truck must have been blue\"\n\nPremise 1: p \u2192 q (If p is true, then q must be true)\nPremise 2: \u00acq (q is false)\n\nConclusion: \u00acp (p is false)\n\nStep 2: Construct a truth table to evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\np | q | p \u2192 q | \u00acq | \u00acp\n--+---+-------+----+----\nT | T |   T   | F  | F\nT | F |   F   | T  | F\nF | T |   T   | F  | T\nF | F |   T   | T  | T\n\nStep 3: Analyze the truth table.\nIn the truth table, when the premises (p \u2192 q and \u00acq) are true, the conclusion (\u00acp) is also true. This means that the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
