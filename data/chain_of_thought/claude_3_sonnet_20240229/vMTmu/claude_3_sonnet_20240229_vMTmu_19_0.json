            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nGiven premises:\n1. If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n2. It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nConclusion:\nTom did not watch football.\n\nStep 1: Represent the premises symbolically.\nLet p = \"Tom watched football\"\nLet q = \"Jen must have watched basketball\"\n\nPremise 1: p \u2192 q (If p, then q)\nPremise 2: \u00acq (Not q)\n\nStep 2: Apply the rules of logic to the premises.\nFrom premise 1 (p \u2192 q) and premise 2 (\u00acq), we can use the Modus Tollens rule, which states:\nIf (p \u2192 q) and (\u00acq), then (\u00acp).\n\nStep 3: Derive the conclusion from the premises.\nUsing Modus Tollens, we can conclude:\n\u00acp (Not p)\nSubstituting the original statements:\n\u00acp = \"Tom did not watch football\"\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Tom did not watch football\" follows logically from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
