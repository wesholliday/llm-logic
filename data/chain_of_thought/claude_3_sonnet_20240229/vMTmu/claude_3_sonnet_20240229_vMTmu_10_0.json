If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\n2. It's not the case that the cat must have been outside.\n\nConclusion:\nThe dog was not inside.\n\nStep 1: Represent the premises symbolically.\nLet p = \"The dog was inside\"\nLet q = \"The cat must have been outside\"\n\nPremise 1: p \u2192 q (If p, then q)\nPremise 2: \u00acq (Not q)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the form:\nPremise 1: p \u2192 q\nPremise 2: \u00acq\nConclusion: \u00acp\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid argument form in classical logic.\n\nStep 3: Check the validity of the argument form.\nIn Modus Tollens, if the first premise states that if p is true, then q must be true, and the second premise states that q is false, then we can validly conclude that p must be false.\n\nIn this case, the premises state:\n1. If the dog was inside (p), then the cat must have been outside (q).\n2. It's not the case that the cat must have been outside (\u00acq).\n\nTherefore, we can validly conclude:\nThe dog was not inside (\u00acp).\n\nAnswer: yes"
