            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nGiven premises:\n1. If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\n2. It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\n\nConclusion:\nThe doll was not plastic.\n\nStep 1: Represent the premises symbolically.\nLet p = \"The doll was plastic\"\nLet q = \"The truck must have been metal\"\n\nPremise 1: p \u2192 q (If p, then q)\nPremise 2: \u00acq (Not q)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the form:\nPremise 1: p \u2192 q\nPremise 2: \u00acq\nConclusion: \u00acp\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid argument form in classical logic.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the argument.\nIn Modus Tollens, if the first premise states that if p is true, then q must be true, and the second premise states that q is false, then we can validly conclude that p must be false.\n\nIn this case, the first premise states that if the doll was plastic (p), then the truck must have been metal (q). The second premise states that it's not the case that the truck must have been metal (\u00acq). Therefore, we can validly conclude that the doll was not plastic (\u00acp).\n\nAnswer: yes"
