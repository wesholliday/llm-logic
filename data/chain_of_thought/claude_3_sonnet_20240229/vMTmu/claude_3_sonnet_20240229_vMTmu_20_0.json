            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nGiven premises:\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\n2. It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\n\nConclusion:\nThe apple was not red.\n\nStep 1: Represent the premises symbolically.\nLet A = \"The apple was red\"\nLet B = \"The banana must have been yellow\"\n\nPremise 1: A \u2192 B (If A is true, then B is true)\nPremise 2: \u00acB (B is false)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the form:\nPremise 1: A \u2192 B\nPremise 2: \u00acB\nConclusion: \u00acA\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid argument form in classical logic.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the argument.\nIn Modus Tollens, if the first premise states that \"If A is true, then B is true\" (A \u2192 B), and the second premise states that \"B is false\" (\u00acB), then the conclusion that \"A is false\" (\u00acA) follows logically and necessarily.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
