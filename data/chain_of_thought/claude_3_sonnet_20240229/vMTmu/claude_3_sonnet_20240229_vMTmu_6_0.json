If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\n2. It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\nConclusion:\nSue did not choose pizza.\n\nStep 1: Represent the premises symbolically.\nLet P = \"Sue chose pizza\"\nLet Q = \"Bob must have chosen pasta\"\n\nPremise 1: P \u2192 Q (If P is true, then Q is true)\nPremise 2: \u00acQ (Q is false)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the form:\nPremise 1: P \u2192 Q\nPremise 2: \u00acQ\nConclusion: \u00acP\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid argument form in classical logic.\n\nStep 3: Verify the validity of the argument using a truth table.\n\nP | Q | P \u2192 Q | \u00acQ | \u00acP\n--+---+-------+----+----\nT | T |   T   | F  | F\nT | F |   F   | T  | F\nF | T |   T   | F  | T\nF | F |   T   | T  | T\n\nThe truth table shows that whenever the premises (P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ) are true, the conclusion (\u00acP) is also true, confirming the validity of the argument.\n\nAnswer: yes"
