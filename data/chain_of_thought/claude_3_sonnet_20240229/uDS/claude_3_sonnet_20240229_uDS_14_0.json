(Disjunction)\n- The milk is not chilling in the fridge. (Negation of one disjunct)\n\nStep 1: Represent the given information symbolically.\nLet A = \"The milk is on the counter\"\nLet B = \"The milk is chilling in the fridge\"\n\nThe given information can be represented as:\nA \u2228 B (Disjunction: Either A or B is true)\n\u00acB (Negation: B is not true)\n\nStep 2: Apply the logical rules.\nIf we have a disjunction (A \u2228 B) and we know that one of the disjuncts (B) is false (\u00acB), then the other disjunct (A) must be true.\n\nThis is based on the logical rule: If (A \u2228 B) and \u00acB, then A must be true.\n\nStep 3: Substitute the symbolic representations with the original statements.\nSince B (\"The milk is chilling in the fridge\") is false (\u00acB), and we have the disjunction (A \u2228 B), then A (\"The milk is on the counter\") must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
