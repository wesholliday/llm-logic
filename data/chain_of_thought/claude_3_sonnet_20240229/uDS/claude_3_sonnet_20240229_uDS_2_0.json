Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table (disjunctive statement).\n2. The book is not resting on the table (negation of one of the disjuncts).\n\nStep 1: Analyze the disjunctive statement.\nIf one part of a disjunction is false, then the other part must be true.\n\nStep 2: Apply the given information to the disjunctive statement.\nSince the second part of the disjunction (\"the book is resting on the table\") is false, according to the given information, the first part (\"the book is on the shelf\") must be true.\n\nStep 3: Draw the conclusion.\nIf the book is not resting on the table, and the only other possibility given is that it is on the shelf, then we can logically infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes"
