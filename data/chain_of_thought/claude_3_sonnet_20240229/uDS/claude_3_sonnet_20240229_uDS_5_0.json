We have two statements:\n   a. \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry.\"\n   b. \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry.\"\n\n2. The first statement is a disjunctive statement, which means that at least one of the two options must be true.\n\n3. The second statement eliminates one of the options from the first statement, which is \"the cookies are hidden in the pantry.\"\n\n4. Since the second statement eliminates one of the options from the first statement, and the first statement states that at least one option must be true, the only remaining option is \"the cookies are in the jar.\"\n\n5. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can logically infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes"
