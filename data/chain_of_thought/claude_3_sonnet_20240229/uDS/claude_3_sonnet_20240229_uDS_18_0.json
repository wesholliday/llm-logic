We are given that the notebook is not on the nightstand.\n3. Since there are only two possible locations, and the notebook is not on the nightstand, the only remaining possibility is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the process of elimination, we can logically infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
