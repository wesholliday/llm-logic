            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical relationship between the given statement and the statement we want to infer.\n\nGiven statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n\nThis is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the apple was red,\" and B is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\nThe statement we want to infer is: \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\"\n\nThis is the contrapositive of the given statement, which has the form \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nIn propositional logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, we can validly infer the contrapositive statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
