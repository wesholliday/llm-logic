            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical relationship between the given statement and the statement we want to infer.\n\nGiven statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThis statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Mary was at the wedding,\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe statement we want to infer is: \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\"\n\nThis statement is the contrapositive of the given statement, which has the form \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nIn propositional logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the contrapositive statement from the given statement.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The given statement is a conditional statement: \"If P, then Q.\"\n2. The statement we want to infer is the contrapositive: \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n3. In propositional logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n4. Since the given statement is true, its contrapositive is also true.\n5. Therefore, we can infer the contrapositive statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
