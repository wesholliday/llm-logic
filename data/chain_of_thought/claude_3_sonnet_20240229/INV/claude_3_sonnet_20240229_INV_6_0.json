            "content": "To determine if the given statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" allows us to infer \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta,\" we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nStep 1: Understand the original statement.\nThe statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\" It means that whenever the condition A (Sue chose pizza) is true, the consequence B (Bob chose pasta) must also be true.\n\nStep 2: Consider the contrapositive.\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nStep 3: Construct the contrapositive.\nIn our case, the contrapositive of \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n\nStep 4: Compare the given statement with the contrapositive.\nThe statement we want to infer is \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\" This statement is not the same as the contrapositive we constructed in Step 3.\n\nStep 5: Determine if the inference is valid.\nThe given statement \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta\" is not logically equivalent to the original statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" Therefore, we cannot infer the former from the latter.\n\nAnswer: no"
