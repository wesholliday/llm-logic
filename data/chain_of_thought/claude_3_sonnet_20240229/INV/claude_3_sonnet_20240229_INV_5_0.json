            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical relationship between the given statement and the statement we want to infer.\n\nThe given statement is: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\"\n\nThis is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"Jeff played basketball,\" and B is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nTo infer the statement \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis,\" we need to take the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nIn our case, the contrapositive would be: \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical equivalence between the original statement and its contrapositive.\n\nIn propositional logic, a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is logically equivalent to its contrapositive \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer the statement \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis\" from the given statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
