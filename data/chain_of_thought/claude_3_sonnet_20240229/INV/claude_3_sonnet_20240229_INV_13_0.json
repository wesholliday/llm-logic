            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical relationship between the given statement and the statement we want to infer.\n\nGiven statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\"\n\nThis is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the car was red,\" and B is \"the truck was blue.\"\n\nThe statement we want to infer is: \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\"\n\nThis is the contrapositive of the given statement, which has the form \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nIn propositional logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, we can validly infer the contrapositive from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
