            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical relationship between the given statement and the statement we want to infer.\n\nGiven statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\"\n\nThis is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the shirt was cotton,\" and B is \"the pants were denim.\"\n\nTo infer the contrapositive statement, \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim,\" we need to negate both the antecedent (A) and the consequent (B) of the original conditional statement.\n\nStep 1: Negate the antecedent (A) by stating its opposite.\nNegation of \"the shirt was cotton\" is \"the shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nStep 2: Negate the consequent (B) by stating its opposite.\nNegation of \"the pants were denim\" is \"the pants were not denim.\"\n\nStep 3: Combine the negated antecedent and consequent with the conditional \"If... then...\" to form the contrapositive statement.\n\"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\"\n\nIn propositional logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, the contrapositive statement must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
