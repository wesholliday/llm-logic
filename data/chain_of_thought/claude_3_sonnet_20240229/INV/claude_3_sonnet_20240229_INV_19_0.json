            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical relationship between the given statement and the statement we want to infer.\n\nGiven statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nThis statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"Tom watched football,\" and B is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nThe statement we want to infer is: \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\"\n\nThis statement is the contrapositive of the given statement, which has the form \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nIn propositional logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the contrapositive statement from the given statement.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The given statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\"\n2. The statement we want to infer is the contrapositive of the given statement: \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\"\n3. In propositional logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n4. Since the given statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n5. Therefore, we can infer the contrapositive statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
