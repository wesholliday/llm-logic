            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical relationship between the given statement and the statement we want to infer.\n\nGiven statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\"\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the given statement.\nThe given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the bear was in the cave,\" and B is \"the wolf was in the den.\"\n\nStep 2: Understand the logical implications of the given statement.\nThe given statement only tells us what happens when A (the bear was in the cave) is true. It does not provide any information about what happens when A is false (the bear was not in the cave).\n\nStep 3: Consider the statement we want to infer.\nThe statement we want to infer is \"If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.\"\n\nStep 4: Analyze the logical relationship between the given statement and the statement we want to infer.\nThe statement we want to infer is the contrapositive of the given statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be: \"If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nHowever, the statement we want to infer is not the contrapositive but rather the inverse of the given statement, which is \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\nStep 5: Determine if the inverse can be logically inferred from the given statement.\nIn general, the inverse of a conditional statement cannot be logically inferred from the given statement. The inverse is a separate statement that may or may not be true, depending on the specific context.\n\nAnswer: no"
