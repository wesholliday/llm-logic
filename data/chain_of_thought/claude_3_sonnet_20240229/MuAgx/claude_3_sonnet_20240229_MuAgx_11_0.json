            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the statement \"The glorp must be wobble and zooble\" can be inferred from \"The glorp must be wobble and it must be zooble\", we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe original statement is a conjunction of two clauses: \"The glorp must be wobble\" and \"it must be zooble\". The pronoun \"it\" in the second clause refers to \"The glorp\" in the first clause.\n\nThe proposed inference replaces the pronoun \"it\" with the noun phrase \"The glorp\", making the conjunction more explicit: \"The glorp must be wobble and The glorp must be zooble\".\n\nSince the two statements have the same logical meaning, the proposed inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
