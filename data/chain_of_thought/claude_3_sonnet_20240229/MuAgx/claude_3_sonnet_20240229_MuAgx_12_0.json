            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'The glorp must be plimp by frazzle and it must be zizz grazzle' contains two separate clauses joined by the conjunction 'and'. The first clause is 'The glorp must be plimp by frazzle', and the second clause is 'it must be zizz grazzle'. The pronoun 'it' in the second clause refers to 'The glorp' from the first clause.\n\nTo infer 'The glorp must be plimp by frazzle and zizz grazzle', we need to combine the two clauses into a single clause by removing the pronoun 'it' and joining the two predicates 'must be plimp by frazzle' and 'must be zizz grazzle' with the conjunction 'and'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
