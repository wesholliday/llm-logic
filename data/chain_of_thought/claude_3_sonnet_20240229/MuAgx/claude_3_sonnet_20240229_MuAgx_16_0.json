            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'The flibbit must be quibble crunk and it must snork zooble wozzle' contains two clauses joined by the conjunction 'and'. The first clause is 'The flibbit must be quibble crunk', and the second clause is 'it must snork zooble wozzle'. The proposed inference 'The flibbit must be quibble crunk and snork zooble wozzle' combines these two clauses by removing the pronoun 'it' and the repeated 'must'. This does not change the overall meaning of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
