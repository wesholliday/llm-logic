It does not contain any copyrighted material or complex instructions that would require reproducing or modifying copyrighted content. To determine if the second sentence can be inferred from the first, I need to compare the two sentences and see if the second sentence is a logical consequence of the first, based on the made-up words used.\n\nThe first sentence states: \"The wobble must be wumble fizzle and it must frazzle at wozzle zump.\"\nThe second sentence states: \"The wobble must be wumble fizzle and frazzle at wozzle zump.\"\n\nThe only difference between the two sentences is the removal of the phrase \"it must\" before \"frazzle at wozzle zump\" in the second sentence.\n\nAnswer: yes"
