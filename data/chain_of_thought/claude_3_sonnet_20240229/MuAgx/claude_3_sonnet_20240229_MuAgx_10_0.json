            "content": "Explanation: In the given statement \"The plonk must be wibble and it must be wibble\", the phrase \"it must be wibble\" is repeated twice. By removing the word \"it\" from the second occurrence, we can infer \"The plonk must be wibble and wibble\". This inference is valid because the meaning of the statement remains the same, and we are simply removing a redundant word without changing the overall meaning.\n\nAnswer: yes"
