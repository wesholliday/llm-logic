Without knowing the meanings of these words, it is impossible to determine the truth value of the statement or make any logical inferences from it.\n\nHowever, the second statement 'The grazzle must be snork on zibble or wump wump wozzle' is a disjunction (a logical 'or' statement) that includes the first statement as one of its disjuncts. In propositional logic, a disjunction is true if at least one of its disjuncts is true.\n\nSince we do not know the truth value of the first statement, we cannot definitively conclude whether the second statement is true or false based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: yes"
