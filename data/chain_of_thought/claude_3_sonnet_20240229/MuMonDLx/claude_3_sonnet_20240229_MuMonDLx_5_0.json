The original statement asserts that the plonk must be quork frozz, but it does not mention anything about the possibility of it being fizzle or the disjunctive 'or' condition. Without additional context or premises, we cannot logically conclude the truth of the second statement from the first one alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
