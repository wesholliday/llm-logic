The original statement only specifies one condition ('by glorp'), while the second statement introduces an additional alternative condition ('or wozzle flimble'). Without further context or information, we cannot determine whether the additional condition is valid or not. The second statement is a broader claim that includes the original statement as a possibility, but it also allows for another possibility ('wozzle flimble') that is not mentioned in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
