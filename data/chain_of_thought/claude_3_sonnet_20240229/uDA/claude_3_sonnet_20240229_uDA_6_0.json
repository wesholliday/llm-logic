Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\n\"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\"\nThis statement means that if the condition \"Sue chose pizza\" (A) is true, then the consequence \"Bob chose pasta\" (B) must also be true.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\n\"Sue did not choose pizza\" is the negation of the condition \"Sue chose pizza\" (A).\n\nStep 3: Apply the logical reasoning.\nIf the condition \"Sue chose pizza\" (A) is false, then the conditional statement \"If A, then B\" does not provide any information about the truth value of the consequence \"Bob chose pasta\" (B).\n\nIn other words, if the condition is false, the consequence can be either true or false, and we cannot make any definite conclusion about it.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nWe cannot infer that Bob did not choose pasta based on the given information. The negation of the condition \"Sue chose pizza\" does not necessarily imply the negation of the consequence \"Bob chose pasta.\" The consequence remains unknown or undetermined."
