If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n2. The shirt was not cotton.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\n\"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\"\nThis is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\"\nIt means that if the antecedent (A: the shirt was cotton) is true, then the consequent (B: the pants were denim) must also be true.\nHowever, if the antecedent is false, the consequent can be either true or false.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\n\"The shirt was not cotton.\"\nThis statement negates the antecedent (A: the shirt was cotton) of the conditional statement in step 1.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of logical inference.\nWhen the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the consequent can be either true or false, and we cannot make any definite conclusion about the consequent.\n\nIn this case, since the shirt was not cotton (the antecedent is false), we cannot infer anything about whether the pants were denim or not.\n\nAnswer: no"
