If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. (Conditional statement)\n2. The vampire was not awake. (Negation of the antecedent)\n\nTo determine if we can infer that the mummy was not awake, we need to consider the logical form of the conditional statement and the negation of the antecedent.\n\nThe conditional statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" can be represented symbolically as:\np \u2192 q\n\nWhere:\np = \"The vampire was awake\"\nq = \"The mummy was awake\"\n\nThe negation of the antecedent is given as \"The vampire was not awake,\" which can be represented as:\n\u00acp\n\nIn propositional logic, the negation of the antecedent (\u00acp) does not allow us to infer the negation of the consequent (\u00acq). In other words, if the antecedent (p) is false, the truth value of the consequent (q) remains unknown.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot logically infer that the mummy was not awake.\n\nAnswer: no"
