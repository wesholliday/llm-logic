            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and apply the rules of logical inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\"\n2. \"The bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the first statement.\nThe first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the bear was in the cave,\" and B is \"the wolf was in the den.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\nThe second statement negates the antecedent (A) of the conditional statement, which is \"the bear was in the cave.\"\n\nStep 3: Apply the logical rule for denying the antecedent.\nIn propositional logic, denying the antecedent of a conditional statement does not allow us to infer anything about the consequent (B). In other words, if A is false, we cannot conclude whether B is true or false.\n\nStep 4: Determine the conclusion.\nSince we cannot infer anything about the consequent (the wolf was in the den) when the antecedent (the bear was in the cave) is false, we cannot conclude that the wolf was not in the den.\n\nAnswer: no"
