If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n2. The griffin was not in the forest.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the first statement.\nThe first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\"\nIn this case, A = \"The griffin was in the forest,\" and B = \"The unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\nThe second statement directly contradicts the antecedent (A) of the conditional statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply the logical reasoning.\nWhen the antecedent (A) of a conditional statement is false, the conditional statement itself becomes a vacuously true statement. This means that the truth value of the consequent (B) does not matter, and the entire conditional statement is considered true.\n\nIn this case, since \"The griffin was not in the forest\" contradicts the antecedent (A), the conditional statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" becomes vacuously true.\n\nStep 4: Determine the conclusion.\nSince the conditional statement is vacuously true, we cannot infer anything about the consequent (B), which is \"The unicorn was in the forest.\" The truth value of the consequent remains unknown based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
