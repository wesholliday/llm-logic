If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n2. Sam did not take a plane.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the first statement.\nThe first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"Sam took a plane,\" and B is \"Erin took a train.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\nThe second statement is the negation of the antecedent (A) in the conditional statement. It states that \"Sam did not take a plane,\" which is the opposite of \"Sam took a plane.\"\n\nStep 3: Apply the logical inference rule.\nIn propositional logic, if the antecedent (A) of a conditional statement (\"If A, then B\") is false, then the conditional statement itself is vacuously true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent (B).\n\nIn this case, since \"Sam did not take a plane\" (the negation of A) is true, the conditional statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is vacuously true, regardless of whether Erin took a train or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer anything about whether Erin took a train or not based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
