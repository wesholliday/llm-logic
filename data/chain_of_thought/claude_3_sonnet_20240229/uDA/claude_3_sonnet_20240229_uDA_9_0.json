If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n2. Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the first statement.\nThe statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and B is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the truth value of the conditional statement.\nSince the antecedent (A) is false (Lisa did not buy the red shirt), the conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is true regardless of the truth value of the consequent (B).\n\nStep 3: Determine if we can infer the truth value of the consequent.\nIn a conditional statement, if the antecedent is false, we cannot infer the truth value of the consequent. The consequent could be either true or false.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nWe cannot infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt based on the given information. The fact that Lisa did not buy the red shirt does not provide enough information to determine whether Mark bought the blue shirt or not."
