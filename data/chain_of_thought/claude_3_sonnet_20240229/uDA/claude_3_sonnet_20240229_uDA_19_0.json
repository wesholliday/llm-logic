            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and apply the rules of logical inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n2. Tom did not watch football.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the first statement.\nThe statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"Tom watched football,\" and B is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the truth value of the conditional statement.\nSince the antecedent (A) is false (Tom did not watch football), the conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is true regardless of the truth value of the consequent (B).\n\nStep 3: Determine if we can infer the truth value of the consequent.\nIn classical logic, if the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, we cannot infer anything about the truth value of the consequent. The consequent could be either true or false.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude whether Jen watched basketball or not.\n\nAnswer: no"
