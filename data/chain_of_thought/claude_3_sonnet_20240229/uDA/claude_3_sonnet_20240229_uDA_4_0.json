If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n2. The alien did not visit Mars.\n\nTo infer whether the robot did not visit Jupiter, we need to consider the logical structure of the first statement, which is a conditional statement (if-then statement).\n\nIn a conditional statement, if the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is false, then the consequent (the \"then\" part) can be either true or false, and we cannot make any definite conclusion about it.\n\nIn this case, the antecedent \"the alien visited Mars\" is false (because the second statement says the alien did not visit Mars).\n\nTherefore, we cannot make any definite conclusion about whether the consequent \"the robot visited Jupiter\" is true or false based on the given information.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\"\n2. The second statement negates the antecedent: \"The alien did not visit Mars.\"\n3. When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the consequent can be either true or false, and we cannot make a definite conclusion about it.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer whether the robot visited Jupiter or not based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
