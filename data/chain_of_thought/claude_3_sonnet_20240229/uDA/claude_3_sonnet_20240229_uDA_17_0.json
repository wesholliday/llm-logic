Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the first statement.\nThe statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" is an implication or conditional statement. It can be represented as:\nP \u2192 Q\nWhere P is \"Ben ate pasta,\" and Q is \"Kate ate salad.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\nThe statement \"Ben did not eat pasta\" is the negation of P, which can be represented as \u00acP.\n\nStep 3: Apply the logical rules of inference.\nIn propositional logic, if the premise (P) of an implication (P \u2192 Q) is false (\u00acP), then the conclusion (Q) cannot be determined. This is because the implication \"If P, then Q\" does not provide any information about Q when P is false.\n\nIn this case, we have \u00acP (Ben did not eat pasta), and we cannot infer anything about Q (whether Kate ate salad or not) from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
