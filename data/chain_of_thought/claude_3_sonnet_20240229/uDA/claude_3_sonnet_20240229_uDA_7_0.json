If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n2. Alex did not finish the race.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the first statement.\nThe statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Alex finished the race,\" and Q is \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\nStep 2: Consider the negation of the antecedent (P).\nThe second statement, \"Alex did not finish the race,\" is the negation of the antecedent (P) in the conditional statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply the logical rule for the negation of the antecedent.\nIn propositional logic, the negation of the antecedent in a conditional statement does not allow us to infer anything about the consequent (Q). In other words, if P is false, the truth value of Q remains unknown.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the conclusion.\nThe question asks if we can infer that Chris did not finish the race, which is the negation of the consequent (Q).\n\nAnswer: No\n\nWe cannot infer that Chris did not finish the race based on the given information. The negation of the antecedent (Alex did not finish the race) does not provide enough information to determine the truth value of the consequent (Chris finished the race). The consequent could be either true or false, and we cannot make a definitive conclusion about it."
