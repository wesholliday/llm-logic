If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n2. Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the first statement.\nThe statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Jeff played basketball,\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\nThe statement \"Jeff did not play basketball\" is the negation of P, which is denoted as ~P.\n\nStep 3: Apply the logical rule of denying the antecedent.\nIn a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" if the antecedent (P) is false (~P), we cannot infer anything about the consequent (Q) or its negation (~Q). This is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent.\n\nIn our case, since we know that ~P (Jeff did not play basketball) is true, we cannot conclude anything about Q (Amy played tennis) or ~Q (Amy did not play tennis) based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nWe cannot infer that Amy did not play tennis based on the given statements. The fact that Jeff did not play basketball does not provide enough information to determine whether Amy played tennis or not."
