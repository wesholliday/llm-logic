In other words, the truth value of the consequent is unknown.\n\nIn this case, since \"the doll was not plastic\" (negation of P), we cannot infer anything about the truth value of \"the truck was metal\" (Q).\n\nAnswer: no\n\nWe cannot infer that the truck was not metal based on the given information. The truth value of \"the truck was metal\" remains unknown."
