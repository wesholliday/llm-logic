If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n2. Joe did not go to the park.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the first statement.\nThe statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"Joe went to the park,\" and B is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\nThe statement \"Joe did not go to the park\" is the negation of the antecedent (A) in the conditional statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply the logical rule for conditional statements with a negated antecedent.\nAccording to the rules of logic, if the antecedent (A) of a conditional statement is false, the conditional statement itself (If A, then B) does not provide any information about the truth value of the consequent (B).\n\nIn other words, if the condition \"Joe went to the park\" is false, we cannot make any definite conclusion about whether \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is true or false based solely on the given conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
