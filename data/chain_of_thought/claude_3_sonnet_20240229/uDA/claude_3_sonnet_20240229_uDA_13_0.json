            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and apply the rules of logic.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\"\n2. \"The car was not red.\"\n\nStep 1: Understand the logical structure of the first statement.\n\"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is an implication or conditional statement. It can be represented as:\nP \u2192 Q\nWhere P is \"the car was red,\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\n\"The car was not red\" is the negation of P, which can be represented as \u00acP.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of logic.\nIn propositional logic, the negation of an implication (P \u2192 Q) is not equivalent to the implication of the negations (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ). In other words, if the antecedent (P) is false, the consequent (Q) can be either true or false, and we cannot infer anything about the truth value of Q.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nWe cannot infer that the truck was not blue from the given statements. The second statement, \"The car was not red,\" only negates the antecedent (P) of the implication, but it does not provide any information about the consequent (Q), which is \"the truck was blue.\" Therefore, we cannot conclude whether the truck was blue or not blue based on the given information."
