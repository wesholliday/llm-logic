If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n2. The book was not written by James.\n\nStep 1: Represent the statements using propositional logic.\nLet p = \"The book was written by James\"\nLet q = \"The book is a mystery novel\"\n\nThe first statement can be represented as: p \u2192 q (If p is true, then q is true)\nThe second statement can be represented as: \u00acp (Not p)\n\nStep 2: Apply the rules of logical inference.\nThe first statement (p \u2192 q) is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (p) is true, then the consequent (q) must also be true. However, if the antecedent (p) is false, then the conditional statement (p \u2192 q) is vacuously true, and we cannot make any conclusion about the consequent (q).\n\nIn this case, the second statement (\u00acp) tells us that the antecedent (p) is false, which means that the conditional statement (p \u2192 q) is vacuously true, and we cannot infer anything about the consequent (q).\n\nStep 3: Determine the answer.\nSince we cannot infer anything about whether the book is a mystery novel or not based on the given statements, we cannot conclude that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: no"
