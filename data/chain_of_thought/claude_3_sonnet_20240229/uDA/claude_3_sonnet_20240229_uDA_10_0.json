The dog was not inside.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\n\"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\"\nThis is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\"\nIt means that if the condition A (the dog was inside) is true, then the consequence B (the cat was outside) must also be true.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\n\"The dog was not inside.\"\nThis statement negates the condition A (the dog was inside) from the first statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of logic.\nWhen the condition (A) of a conditional statement (\"If A, then B\") is false, the truth value of the consequence (B) cannot be determined.\n\nIn this case, since the condition \"the dog was inside\" is false (because the dog was not inside), we cannot infer anything about the truth value of the consequence \"the cat was outside.\"\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that the cat was not outside based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
