If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n2. Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the first statement.\nThe statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P represents \"Mary was at the wedding,\" and Q represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\nThe statement \"Mary was not at the wedding\" is the negation of P, which is represented as \"not P.\"\n\nStep 3: Apply the logical rule of denying the antecedent.\nIn a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" if the antecedent (P) is false (not P), then we cannot make any definite conclusion about the consequent (Q). In other words, if P is false, Q can be either true or false.\n\nIn this case, since we know that \"not P\" (Mary was not at the wedding) is true, we cannot definitively conclude whether \"Q\" (Sue was at the wedding) is true or false.\n\nAnswer: no"
