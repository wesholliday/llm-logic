It can be represented as:\np \u2192 q\nwhere p is \"the apple was red,\" and q is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\n\"The apple was not red\" is the negation of the antecedent (p) in the conditional statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply the law of logic for conditional statements.\nAccording to the law of logic, if the antecedent (p) of a conditional statement (p \u2192 q) is false, the conditional statement itself is vacuously true, and we cannot infer anything about the consequent (q).\n\nIn this case, since \"the apple was not red\" (\u00acp) is true, the conditional statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" (p \u2192 q) is vacuously true, regardless of whether the banana was yellow or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer anything about the banana being yellow or not yellow based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
