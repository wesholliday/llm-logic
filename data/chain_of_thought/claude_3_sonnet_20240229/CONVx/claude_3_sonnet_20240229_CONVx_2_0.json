The contrapositive of p \u2192 q is \u00acq \u2192 \u00acp (If not q, then not p).\n\nHowever, the converse of a conditional statement (q \u2192 p) is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement (p \u2192 q). The converse can only be inferred if additional information or assumptions are provided.\n\nIn this case, no additional information is given, so we cannot infer the converse (q \u2192 p) from the original statement (p \u2192 q).\n\nAnswer: no"
