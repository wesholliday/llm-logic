This is because the truth values of the two statements can be different.\n\nFor example, if p is false and q is true, then p \u2192 q (false \u2192 true) is true, but q \u2192 p (true \u2192 false) is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the flug was zimmed, then the flug was blummed\" from the given statement \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\"\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Represent the given statement symbolically: p \u2192 q\n2. The statement we want to infer is: q \u2192 p\n3. In propositional logic, p \u2192 q does not imply q \u2192 p\n4. There are truth value assignments where p \u2192 q is true, but q \u2192 p is false\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer q \u2192 p from p \u2192 q\n\nAnswer: no"
