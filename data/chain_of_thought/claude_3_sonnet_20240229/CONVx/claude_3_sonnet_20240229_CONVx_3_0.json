            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical relationship between the given statement and the statement we want to infer.\n\nGiven statement: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\"\nLet's represent this statement symbolically:\nP \u2192 Q\nWhere P = \"the splat was morphed,\" and Q = \"the splat quanked.\"\n\nThe statement we want to infer is: \"If the splat quanked, then the splat was morphed.\"\nSymbolically, this would be:\nQ \u2192 P\n\nNow, we need to check if the inference is logically valid or not.\n\nIn propositional logic, the inference \"Q \u2192 P\" cannot be logically deduced from the statement \"P \u2192 Q\" alone. This is because the conditional statement \"P \u2192 Q\" does not provide enough information to conclude the converse statement \"Q \u2192 P.\"\n\nTo illustrate this, consider the following example:\n\"If it rains, then the ground is wet.\"\nThis statement does not necessarily imply that \"If the ground is wet, then it rained.\" The ground could be wet due to other reasons, such as a sprinkler system or a spill.\n\nTherefore, the inference \"If the splat quanked, then the splat was morphed\" cannot be logically deduced from the given statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
