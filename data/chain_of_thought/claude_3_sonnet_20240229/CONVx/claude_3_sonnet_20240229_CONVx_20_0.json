In other words, we cannot infer the converse from the given statement without additional information or assumptions.\n\nTherefore, step-by-step reasoning:\n1) The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\"\n2) To infer \"If B, then A,\" we need to consider the converse of the given statement.\n3) The converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement.\n4) Without additional information or assumptions, we cannot infer the converse from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
