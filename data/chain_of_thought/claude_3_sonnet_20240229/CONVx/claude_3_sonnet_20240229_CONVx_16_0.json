The contrapositive of p \u2192 q is \u00acq \u2192 \u00acp (If not q, then not p).\n\nHowever, the converse of a conditional statement (q \u2192 p) is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement (p \u2192 q).\n\nStep 1: Write the contrapositive of the given statement.\nContrapositive: \u00acq \u2192 \u00acp (If the sneg did not sprote the frink, then the sneg was not crampled)\n\nStep 2: Compare the contrapositive with the statement we want to infer.\nStatement to infer: q \u2192 p (If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was crampled)\n\nThe contrapositive (\u00acq \u2192 \u00acp) and the statement we want to infer (q \u2192 p) are not logically equivalent.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was crampled\" from the given statement \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
