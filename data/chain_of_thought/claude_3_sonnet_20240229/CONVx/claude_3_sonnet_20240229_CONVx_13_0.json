This is because the truth of the conditional statement p \u2192 q does not imply the truth of the converse statement q \u2192 p.\n\nFor example, consider the statement: \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" This statement does not necessarily imply that \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining,\" as there could be other reasons for the ground to be wet, such as a sprinkler system or a spill.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If the glip was tragged, then the glip was slogged\" from the given statement \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
