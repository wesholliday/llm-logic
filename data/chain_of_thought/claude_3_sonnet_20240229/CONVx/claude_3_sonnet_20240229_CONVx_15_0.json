The converse can only be inferred if we have additional information or if the original statement is a biconditional (p \u2194 q).\n\nSince we don't have any additional information and the given statement is not a biconditional, we cannot infer the converse statement \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
