This fallacy is known as the \"converse error\" or \"affirming the consequent.\"\n\nThe converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true, even if the original statement is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was blimmed\" from the given statement \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
