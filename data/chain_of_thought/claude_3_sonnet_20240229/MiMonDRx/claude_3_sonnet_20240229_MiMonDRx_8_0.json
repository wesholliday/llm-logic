However, it does not provide any information about whether 'quank' could also be 'wozzle'.\n\nFor the second statement 'The quank might be wozzle or quorple' to be inferred from the original statement, the original statement should either explicitly state or logically imply that 'quank' could be 'wozzle' or 'quorple'.\n\nSince the original statement only mentions the possibility of 'quank' being 'quorple' and does not provide any information about 'wozzle', we cannot infer the second statement from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
