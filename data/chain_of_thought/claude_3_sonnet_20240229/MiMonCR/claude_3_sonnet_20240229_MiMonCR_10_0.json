            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The athlete might be injured and unable to compete\" is a compound statement consisting of two parts joined by the conjunction \"and\". The first part is \"The athlete might be injured\", and the second part is \"unable to compete\". If the first part is true (the athlete is injured), then the second part (unable to compete) must also be true, since an injury would likely prevent an athlete from competing. Therefore, the statement \"The athlete might be unable to compete\" is a logical consequence of the original statement, as it is implied by one of the parts of the compound statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
