            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The concert might be sold out and feature a famous band\" is a compound statement made up of two parts joined by the conjunction \"and\". The first part is \"The concert might be sold out\", and the second part is \"feature a famous band\". To determine if we can infer \"The concert might feature a famous band\" from the original statement, we need to check if the second part is stated independently in the original statement.\n\nIn this case, the second part \"feature a famous band\" is indeed stated independently within the compound statement. Therefore, we can infer or extract this part as a separate statement from the original compound statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
