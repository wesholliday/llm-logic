This is known as the \"modus tollens\" rule of inference.\n\nIn this case, if we assume that the conditional statement \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\" is true, and we know that \"The fribble did not crink\" (the consequent is false), then we can logically infer that \"The fribble was not snurgled\" (the antecedent must be false).\n\nAnswer: yes"
