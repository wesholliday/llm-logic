This is known as the \"modus tollens\" rule of inference.\n\nStep 1: Represent the given statements symbolically.\nLet P = \"The sprocket was cranked.\"\nLet Q = \"The sprocket was daggled.\"\n\nThe first statement can be written as: P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\nThe second statement can be written as: \u00acQ (Not Q)\n\nStep 2: Apply the modus tollens rule of inference.\nPremise 1: P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\nPremise 2: \u00acQ (Not Q)\nConclusion: \u00acP (Not P)\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that \"The sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
