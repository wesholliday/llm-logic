This is known as the \"modus tollens\" rule of inference.\n\nStep 1: Represent the statements symbolically.\nLet A = \"The flugel was blimmed.\"\nLet B = \"The flugel was zargled.\"\n\nThe given statements can be represented as:\n1. A \u2192 B (If A, then B)\n2. \u00acB (Not B)\n\nStep 2: Apply the modus tollens rule of inference.\nIf we have:\nA \u2192 B (If A, then B)\n\u00acB (Not B)\nThen we can infer:\n\u00acA (Not A)\n\nStep 3: Translate the conclusion back to English.\n\u00acA = \"The flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
