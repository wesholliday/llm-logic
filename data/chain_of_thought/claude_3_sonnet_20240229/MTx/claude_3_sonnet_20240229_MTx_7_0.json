This is known as the fallacy of denying the consequent.\n\nHowever, if we negate the antecedent (A), we can infer the negation of the consequent (B) based on the given conditional statement.\n\nStep 1: Negate the antecedent (A) of the conditional statement.\n\"The whiffle was not shanked.\"\n\nStep 2: Apply the conditional statement to the negated antecedent.\n\"If the whiffle was not shanked, then the whiffle did not tink.\"\n\nStep 3: Compare the conclusion from Step 2 with the given statement \"The whiffle did not tink.\"\nThey are the same, so we can infer \"The whiffle was not shanked\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
