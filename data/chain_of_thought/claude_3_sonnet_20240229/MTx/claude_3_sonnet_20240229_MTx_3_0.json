This is known as the \"modus tollens\" rule of inference.\n\nStep 1: Represent the given statements symbolically.\nLet p = \"The splat was morphed.\"\nLet q = \"The splat quanked.\"\n\nThe first statement can be written as: p \u2192 q (If p, then q)\nThe second statement can be written as: \u00acq (Not q)\n\nStep 2: Apply the modus tollens rule of inference.\nPremise 1: p \u2192 q (If p, then q)\nPremise 2: \u00acq (Not q)\nConclusion: \u00acp (Not p)\n\nStep 3: Translate the conclusion back into English.\n\u00acp means \"The splat was not morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
