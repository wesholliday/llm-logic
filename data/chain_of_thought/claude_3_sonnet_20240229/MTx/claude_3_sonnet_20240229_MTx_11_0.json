In other words, if \"B\" is false, it does not necessarily mean that \"A\" is false.\n\nHowever, if we negate the entire conditional statement (\"If A, then B\"), then we can infer the negation of the antecedent (A) when the consequent (B) is false.\n\nIn this case, we have the negation of the consequent (\"The flug was not zimmed\"), but we do not have the negation of the entire conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot logically infer \"The flug was not blummed.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
