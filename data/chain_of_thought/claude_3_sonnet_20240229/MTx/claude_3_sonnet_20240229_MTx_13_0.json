This is known as the fallacy of denying the consequent.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot logically infer that \"The glip was not slogged.\"\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The first statement establishes a conditional relationship: If A (the glip was slogged), then B (the glip was tragged).\n2. The second statement negates the consequent B: The glip was not tragged.\n3. Negating the consequent of a conditional statement does not allow us to infer the negation of the antecedent.\n4. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"The glip was not slogged\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
