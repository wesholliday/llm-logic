It has the form:\n\nIf P (antecedent), then Q (consequent).\n\nIn this case, P is \"Ben ate pasta,\" and Q is \"Kate ate salad.\"\n\nThe second statement directly affirms the consequent Q, \"Kate ate salad.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\nIf the antecedent (P) is true, and the conditional statement (If P, then Q) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true. This is known as the rule of affirming the antecedent (modus ponens).\n\nHowever, if we only know that the consequent (Q) is true, we cannot logically infer that the antecedent (P) is true. This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nIn our case, we know that \"Kate ate salad\" (Q) is true, but we cannot logically infer that \"Ben ate pasta\" (P) is true based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
