This is known as the \"fallacy of affirming the consequent.\"\n\nThe correct inference from \"p \u2192 q\" and \"q\" is not \"p,\" but rather \"\u00acp \u2192 \u00acq\" (if not p, then not q).\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot logically infer \"The book was written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
