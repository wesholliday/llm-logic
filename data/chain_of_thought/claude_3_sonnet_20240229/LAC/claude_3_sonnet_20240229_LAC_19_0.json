            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and apply the rules of logical inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\"\n2. \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"Tom watched football,\" and B is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nThe second statement affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn propositional logic, affirming the consequent of a conditional statement does not allow us to infer the antecedent (A). In other words, from \"If A, then B\" and \"B,\" we cannot logically conclude \"A.\"\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The first statement establishes a sufficient condition for Jen watching basketball, which is Tom watching football.\n2. The second statement confirms that Jen watched basketball.\n3. However, there could be other reasons or conditions that led to Jen watching basketball, besides Tom watching football.\n4. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that Tom watched football based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
