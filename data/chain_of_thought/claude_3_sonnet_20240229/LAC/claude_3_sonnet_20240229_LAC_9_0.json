            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n2. \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. It has the form:\nIf A (antecedent), then B (consequent).\n\nThe second statement affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn propositional logic, if the antecedent (A) of a conditional statement is true, and the conditional statement itself is true, then the consequent (B) must also be true. This is known as the \"modus ponens\" rule of inference.\n\nHowever, in this case, we are given the consequent (B) as true, and we want to infer the antecedent (A). This type of reasoning is known as the \"fallacy of affirming the consequent,\" and it is an invalid form of argument.\n\nIn other words, if the conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is true, and we know that B is true, we cannot logically infer that A is true. There could be other reasons or conditions that led to B being true, independent of A.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The given conditional statement is: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n2. The second statement affirms the consequent: \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n3. To infer \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" from these statements would be an invalid form of argument (affirming the consequent fallacy).\n4. The truth of the consequent (\"Mark bought the blue shirt\") does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (\"Lisa bought the red shirt\").\n\nAnswer: no"
