In other words, from \"If A, then B\" and \"B,\" we cannot logically conclude \"A.\"\n\nThis is because there could be other reasons or conditions that lead to the consequent (B) being true, even if the antecedent (A) is false.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot logically infer that \"Jeff played basketball.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
