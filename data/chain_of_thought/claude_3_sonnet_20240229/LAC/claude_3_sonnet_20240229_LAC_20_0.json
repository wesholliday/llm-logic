            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n2. \"The banana was yellow.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the apple was red,\" and B is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\nThe second statement affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn propositional logic, affirming the consequent of a conditional statement does not allow us to infer the antecedent (A). In other words, from \"If A, then B\" and \"B\" being true, we cannot logically conclude that \"A\" is true.\n\nThis is because there could be other reasons or conditions that lead to \"B\" being true, independent of \"A\" being true.\n\nAnswer: no"
