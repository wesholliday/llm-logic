In other words, from \"If A, then B\" and \"B,\" we cannot logically conclude \"A.\"\n\nTo illustrate this, consider the following example:\n\"If it rains, then the ground will be wet.\"\n\"The ground is wet.\"\nFrom these statements, we cannot logically infer that \"It rained,\" because there could be other reasons for the ground to be wet, such as a sprinkler system or a spill.\n\nSimilarly, in the given problem, from \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and \"Sue was at the wedding,\" we cannot logically infer \"Mary was at the wedding.\" There could be other reasons for Sue to be at the wedding, even if Mary was not there.\n\nAnswer: no"
