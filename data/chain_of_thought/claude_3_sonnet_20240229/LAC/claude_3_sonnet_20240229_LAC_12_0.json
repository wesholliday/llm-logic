It has the form:\nIf A (antecedent), then B (consequent).\n\nThe second statement affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn propositional logic, affirming the consequent of a conditional statement does not allow us to infer the antecedent. In other words, from the statements \"If A, then B\" and \"B,\" we cannot logically conclude \"A.\"\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The first statement establishes a conditional relationship: \"If Joe went to the park (A), then Lucy went to the zoo (B).\"\n2. The second statement affirms the consequent: \"Lucy went to the zoo (B).\"\n3. However, affirming the consequent does not necessarily imply that the antecedent is true.\n4. There could be other reasons or conditions that led to Lucy going to the zoo, independent of Joe going to the park.\n5. Therefore, we cannot logically infer \"Joe went to the park\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
