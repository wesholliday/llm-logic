In other words, from \"If A, then B\" and \"B\" being true, we cannot logically conclude that \"A\" is true.\n\nThis is because there could be other reasons or conditions that lead to \"B\" being true, independent of \"A\" being true.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nWe cannot logically infer \"The car was red\" from the given statements. The affirmation of the consequent (\"The truck was blue\") does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (\"The car was red\") in a conditional statement."
