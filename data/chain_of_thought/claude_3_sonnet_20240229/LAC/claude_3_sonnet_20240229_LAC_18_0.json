            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\n2. \"The truck was metal.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the doll was plastic,\" and B is \"the truck was metal.\"\n\nThe second statement affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn propositional logic, affirming the consequent of a conditional statement does not allow us to infer the antecedent (A). In other words, from \"If A, then B\" and \"B is true,\" we cannot logically conclude that \"A is true.\"\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The first statement establishes a conditional relationship: If the doll was plastic (A), then the truck was metal (B).\n2. The second statement affirms the consequent (B): The truck was metal.\n3. However, affirming the consequent does not logically imply the truth of the antecedent (A).\n4. There could be other reasons or conditions that led to the truck being metal, even if the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: no"
