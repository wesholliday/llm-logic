It has the form:\n\nIf A (antecedent), then B (consequent).\n\nIn this case, A is \"Alex finished the race,\" and B is \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\nThe second statement directly affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\nIf the antecedent (A) of a conditional statement is true, and the conditional statement itself is true, then the consequent (B) must also be true. This is known as the rule of \"modus ponens\" or \"affirming the antecedent.\"\n\nHowever, if we are given the consequent (B) as true, we cannot logically infer the truth of the antecedent (A). This is known as the \"fallacy of affirming the consequent,\" and it is an invalid logical inference.\n\nIn our case, we are given that \"Chris finished the race\" (the consequent B) is true, but we cannot logically infer that \"Alex finished the race\" (the antecedent A) is true based solely on this information.\n\nAnswer: no"
