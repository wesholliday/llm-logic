If \"The dog must have been inside\" is true, then \"The dog might not have been inside\" must be false.\n2. However, if \"The dog might not have been inside\" is true, it does not necessarily mean that \"The dog must have been inside\" is false.\n\nIn other words, the statement \"The dog might not have been inside\" is compatible with both the possibility that the dog was inside and the possibility that the dog was not inside.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the dog must have been inside\" from \"The dog might not have been inside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
