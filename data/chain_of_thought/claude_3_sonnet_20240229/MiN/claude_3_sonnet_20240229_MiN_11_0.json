If it is possible that the newspaper is not in the driveway, then it cannot be the case that the newspaper must be in the driveway.\n2. If the newspaper must be in the driveway, then it would be impossible for it not to be in the driveway.\n\nTherefore, by stating that the newspaper might not be in the driveway, we are implying that it is not the case that the newspaper must be in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes"
