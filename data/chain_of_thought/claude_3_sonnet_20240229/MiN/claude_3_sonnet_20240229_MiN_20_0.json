If the sunglasses might not be in her bag (it is possible that they are not in her bag), then it cannot be the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag (it is not necessary that they are in her bag).\n\n2. In other words, if the possibility of the sunglasses not being in her bag is true, then the necessity of the sunglasses being in her bag must be false.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag\" from the given statement \"The sunglasses might not be in her bag.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
