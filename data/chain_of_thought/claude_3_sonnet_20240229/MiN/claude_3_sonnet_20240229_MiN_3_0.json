It leaves open the possibility that James did not write the book, but it does not definitively assert that he did not write it.\n\nThe proposed inference: \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James.\"\n\nThis inference is logically equivalent to saying that it is possible that the book was not written by James.\n\nStep 1: Negate the given statement.\n\"The book must have been written by James.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the negated statement and the proposed inference.\nThe negated statement asserts that James definitely wrote the book, while the proposed inference denies this certainty by stating that it is possible that James did not write the book.\n\nTherefore, the proposed inference logically follows from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
