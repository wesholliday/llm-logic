The first statement \"The plimp might be blurble quank\" is a simple declarative statement asserting a possibility. The second statement \"The plimp might be blurble quank and zibble at zibber zibber\" adds additional information to the first statement. However, the second statement does not contradict or negate the first statement. It simply provides more details about the possibility mentioned in the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
