However, it does not preclude other possibilities or provide any information about additional conditions like 'snizzle flibbit gribble'.\n\nThe inferred statement 'The grooble might be wumble and snizzle flibbit gribble' adds extra conditions ('snizzle flibbit gribble') to the original possibility.
