However, it does not provide any information about the blimp being blurble by froodle.\n\nThe inferred statement 'The blimp might be zooble and be blurble by froodle' introduces an additional condition 'be blurble by froodle' that is not present in the original statement. To logically infer this compound statement, the original statement would need to explicitly state or imply that the blimp being blurble by froodle is also a possibility.\n\nSince the original statement does not provide any information about the blimp being blurble by froodle, we cannot logically infer the compound statement from it.\n\nAnswer: no"
