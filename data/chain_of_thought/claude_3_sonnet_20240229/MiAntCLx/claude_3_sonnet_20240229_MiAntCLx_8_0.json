It does not provide any meaningful information or context. To infer the additional statement 'The floob might be zooble on flibbit and snork flimble wibble' would be purely speculative, as there is no logical connection between the two statements. Without any context or established meaning for these made-up words, it is impossible to make a valid inference or draw a logical conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
