However, this statement does not necessarily imply that \"The wibble must be blimple\" alone. The wibble could be \"flibbit wozzle\" and still satisfy the original statement. To infer \"The wibble must be blimple\" from the given statement, we would need additional information or premises that rule out the possibility of the wibble being \"flibbit wozzle\".\n\nAnswer: no"
