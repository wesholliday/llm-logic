            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If A, then B (If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball)\nPremise 2: B (Jen watched basketball)\nConclusion: A (Tom watched football)\n\nThis form is known as the affirming the consequent fallacy, which is an invalid form of argument.\n\nStep 2: Explain the reasoning.\nThe argument tries to affirm the antecedent (A) based on the consequent (B) being true. However, this does not necessarily follow logically. Even if the consequent (Jen watched basketball) is true, it does not guarantee that the antecedent (Tom watched football) is also true.\n\nThere could be other reasons or conditions that led to Jen watching basketball, independent of whether Tom watched football or not.\n\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument.\nSince the argument commits the affirming the consequent fallacy, which is an invalid form of reasoning, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
