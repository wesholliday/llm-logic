            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If P, then Q (If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt)\nPremise 2: Q (Mark bought the blue shirt)\nConclusion: P (Lisa bought the red shirt)\n\nThis form is known as the \"modus ponens\" argument form, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic.\n\nStep 2: Check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\nIn the modus ponens form, if the first premise states that \"If P, then Q\" is true, and the second premise states that \"Q\" is true, then it logically follows that \"P\" must also be true.\n\nIn this case, if the first premise \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true, and the second premise \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true, then it logically follows that the conclusion \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
