There could be other reasons why the book is a mystery novel, even if it was not written by James.\n\nFor the argument to be valid, the premises would need to take the form:\nPremise 1: If A, then B\nPremise 2: A\nConclusion: B\n\nThis form is known as \"Modus Ponens\" and is a valid argument form.\n\nAnswer: no"
