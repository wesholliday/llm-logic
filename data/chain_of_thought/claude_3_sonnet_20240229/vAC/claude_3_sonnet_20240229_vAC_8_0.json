            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nLet's represent the premises and conclusion using symbolic notation:\nP: The vampire was awake\nQ: The mummy was awake\n\nThe first premise is: If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q)\nThe second premise is: Q\nThe conclusion is: P\n\nStep 2: Analyze the logical form.\nThe argument has the form:\nPremise 1: P \u2192 Q\nPremise 2: Q\nConclusion: P\n\nThis form of argument is known as the \"Modus Ponens\" rule of inference, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity.\nIf the premises (P \u2192 Q and Q) are true, then the conclusion (P) must also be true. In other words, if it is true that \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" and it is true that \"The mummy was awake,\" then it logically follows that \"The vampire was awake.\"\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
