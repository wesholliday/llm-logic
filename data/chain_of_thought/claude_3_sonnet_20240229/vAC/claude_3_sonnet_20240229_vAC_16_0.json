            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If A, then B (If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim)\nPremise 2: B (The pants were denim)\nConclusion: A (The shirt was cotton)\n\nThis form is known as the affirming the consequent fallacy, which is an invalid form of argument.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the validity of the argument form.\nThe affirming the consequent fallacy is invalid because the truth of the consequent (B) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (A). In other words, even if the pants were denim, it does not necessarily mean that the shirt was cotton.\n\nThere could be other possible reasons for the pants being denim that are not related to the shirt being cotton. The argument form fails to establish a necessary connection between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument.\nSince the argument has an invalid logical form, it is not logically valid. The conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
