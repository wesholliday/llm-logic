            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its logical form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the argument.\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If A, then B (If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding)\nPremise 2: B (Sue was at the wedding)\nConclusion: A (Mary was at the wedding)\n\nThis form of argument is known as the \"Affirmation of the Consequent\" fallacy, which is an invalid form of argument.\n\nStep 2: Explain why the argument is invalid.\nThe \"Affirmation of the Consequent\" fallacy occurs when the argument assumes that if the consequent (B) is true, then the antecedent (A) must also be true. However, this is not a valid inference because the consequent (B) can be true for reasons other than the antecedent (A) being true.\n\nIn this case, the argument assumes that if Sue was at the wedding (consequent), then Mary must have been at the wedding (antecedent). However, this does not necessarily follow because there could be other reasons why Sue was at the wedding, even if Mary was not there.\n\nStep 3: Provide a counterexample to demonstrate the invalidity.\nA counterexample can help illustrate why the argument is invalid. For instance, consider the following scenario:\n\nPremise 1: If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\nPremise 2: The ground is wet.\nConclusion: It's raining.\n\nIn this case, the ground being wet (consequent) does not necessarily mean that it's raining (antecedent). The ground could be wet due to other reasons, such as a sprinkler system or a spilled liquid.\n\nAnswer: no"
