This means that the second part of the disjunction in Premise 2 is false.\n\nAccording to the rules of propositional logic, if one part of a disjunction is false, then the other part must be true for the entire disjunction to be true.\n\nTherefore, since \"The dreb is not spened\" is true, and the disjunction in Premise 2 must be true, we can infer that \"The dreb is vroombed\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
