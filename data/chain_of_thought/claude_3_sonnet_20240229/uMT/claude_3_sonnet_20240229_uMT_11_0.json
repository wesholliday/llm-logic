(Conditional statement)\n- The muffins were not blueberry. (Negation of the consequent)\n\nStep 1: Understand the conditional statement.\nIf A (the cake was chocolate), then B (the muffins were blueberry).\nThis is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\nStep 2: Consider the negation of the consequent.\nThe muffins were not blueberry.\nThis negates the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply the logical reasoning.\nIn a conditional statement, if the consequent (B) is false, we cannot make any definite conclusion about the antecedent (A).\n\nIn other words, if \"If A, then B\" is true, and we know that B is false, we cannot infer anything about A being true or false.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nWe cannot infer that the cake was not chocolate based on the given information. The negation of the consequent does not allow us to conclude anything about the antecedent in a conditional statement."
