(Conditional statement)\n- The wolf was not in the den. (Negation of the consequent)\n\nStep 1: Represent the conditional statement symbolically.\nLet A = \"The bear was in the cave\"\nLet B = \"The wolf was in the den\"\nThe conditional statement can be written as: A \u2192 B (If A is true, then B is true)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the negation of the consequent.\nThe negation of the consequent (B) is given as \"The wolf was not in the den,\" which is represented as \u00acB.\n\nStep 3: Use the logical reasoning principle.\nIn classical logic, the negation of the consequent (\u00acB) does not allow us to infer the negation of the antecedent (\u00acA). In other words, if the consequent is false, we cannot conclude whether the antecedent is true or false.\n\nStep 4: Determine the answer.\nSince we cannot infer the negation of the antecedent (\u00acA) from the negation of the consequent (\u00acB), we cannot conclude that \"the bear was not in the cave\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
