            "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two premises:\n   Premise 1: If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n   Premise 2: The cat was not outside.\n\n2. We want to determine if we can infer that the dog was not inside.\n\n3. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If A, then B\" (If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside).\n\n4. The second premise negates the consequent (B) of the conditional statement: \"Not B\" (The cat was not outside).\n\n5. In propositional logic, if the conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is true, and the consequent (B) is false, then we can infer that the antecedent (A) is also false.\n\n6. Therefore, if the first premise is true (If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside), and the second premise is true (The cat was not outside), then we can infer that the antecedent (The dog was inside) is false.\n\nAnswer: yes"
