(Conditional statement)\n- Lucy did not go to the zoo. (Negation of the consequent)\n\nStep 1: Represent the conditional statement symbolically.\nLet P = \"Joe went to the park\"\nLet Q = \"Lucy went to the zoo\"\nThe conditional statement can be written as: P \u2192 Q (If P is true, then Q is true)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the negation of the consequent.\nThe negation of the consequent (Q) is given as \"Lucy did not go to the zoo,\" which is represented as \u00acQ.\n\nStep 3: Use the logical reasoning principle.\nIn classical logic, the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ) does not allow us to infer the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP). In other words, if the consequent is false, we cannot conclude that the antecedent is also false.\n\nStep 4: Draw the conclusion.\nSince the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ) does not logically imply the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP), we cannot infer that \"Joe did not go to the park\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
