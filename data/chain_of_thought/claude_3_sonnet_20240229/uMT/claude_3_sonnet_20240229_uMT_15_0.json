Erin did not take a train.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\nThe first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\"\nIn this case, A is \"Sam took a plane,\" and B is \"Erin took a train.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\nThe second statement directly contradicts the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply logical reasoning.\nIf the consequent (B) of a conditional statement is false, then the antecedent (A) must also be false.\nIn other words, if \"Erin took a train\" is false, then \"Sam took a plane\" must also be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes"
