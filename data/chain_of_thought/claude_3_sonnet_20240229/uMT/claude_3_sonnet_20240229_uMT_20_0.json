(Conditional statement)\n- The banana was not yellow. (Negation of the consequent)\n\nStep 1: Represent the conditional statement symbolically.\nLet A = \"The apple was red\"\nLet B = \"The banana was yellow\"\nThe conditional statement can be written as: A \u2192 B (If A, then B)\n\nStep 2: Consider the negation of the consequent (B is false).\nWe are given that the banana was not yellow, which means B is false.\n\nStep 3: Apply the law of contrapositive.\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement (A \u2192 B) is (\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA).\nIf the consequent (B) is false, then the antecedent (A) must also be false.\n\nStep 4: Draw the conclusion.\nSince the banana was not yellow (\u00acB), and the contrapositive of the conditional statement holds, we can infer that the apple was not red (\u00acA).\n\nAnswer: yes"
