(Conditional statement)\n- The truck was not blue. (Negation of the consequent)\n\nStep 1: Represent the conditional statement symbolically.\nLet P = \"The car was red\"\nLet Q = \"The truck was blue\"\nThe conditional statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" can be represented as P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the negation of the consequent.\nThe statement \"The truck was not blue\" is the negation of the consequent Q, which is represented as \u00acQ.\n\nStep 3: Apply the law of contrapositive.\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) is (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP).\nIf the conditional statement is true, and we know that the consequent (Q) is false (\u00acQ), then we can infer that the antecedent (P) is also false (\u00acP).\n\nStep 4: Draw the conclusion.\nSince we know that \"The truck was not blue\" (\u00acQ), and the conditional statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" (P \u2192 Q) is true, we can apply the law of contrapositive and conclude that \"The car was not red\" (\u00acP).\n\nAnswer: yes"
