            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and use logical reasoning.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n2. Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt based on these statements.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\n\"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\nThis is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. It means that if the condition \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true, then the consequence \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" must also be true.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\n\"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\nThis statement directly contradicts the consequence of the first statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply logical reasoning.\nIf the consequence of the first statement (\"Mark bought the blue shirt\") is false, then the condition (\"Lisa bought the red shirt\") must also be false. This is based on the principle of contrapositive in logic.\n\nThe contrapositive of the first statement is: \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\nSince we know that \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" is true, we can infer that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
