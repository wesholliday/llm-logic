If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. (Conditional statement)\n2. The mummy was not awake. (Negation of the consequent)\n\nWe can represent the statements symbolically as follows:\nLet V = \"The vampire was awake\"\nLet M = \"The mummy was awake\"\n\nThe first statement can be written as: V \u2192 M (If V is true, then M is true)\nThe second statement can be written as: \u00acM (M is false)\n\nNow, we need to consider the logical form of the argument and apply the rules of inference.\n\nThe argument has the form:\nV \u2192 M (Premise 1)\n\u00acM (Premise 2)\n\u2234 \u00acV (Conclusion)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"Modus Tollens\" or \"Denying the Consequent,\" which is a valid form of argument in classical logic.\n\nThe reasoning goes like this:\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. (Premise 1)\n2. The mummy was not awake. (Premise 2)\n3. If the consequent (the mummy was awake) is false, then the antecedent (the vampire was awake) must also be false.\n\nTherefore, we can validly infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes"
