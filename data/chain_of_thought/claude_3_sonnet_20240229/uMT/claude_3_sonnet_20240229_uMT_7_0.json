(Conditional statement)\n- Chris did not finish the race.\n\nStep 1: Represent the conditional statement symbolically.\nLet A = \"Alex finished the race\"\nLet C = \"Chris finished the race\"\nThe conditional statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" can be represented as A \u2192 C (If A is true, then C is true).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the contrapositive of the conditional statement.\nThe contrapositive of A \u2192 C is \u00acC \u2192 \u00acA (If C is false, then A is false).\n\nStep 3: Use the given information and the contrapositive.\nWe know that Chris did not finish the race, which means C is false (\u00acC is true).\nFrom the contrapositive \u00acC \u2192 \u00acA, if \u00acC is true, then \u00acA must be true.\nTherefore, if Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes"
