(Conditional statement)\n- The robot did not visit Jupiter. (Negation of the consequent)\n\nStep 1: Represent the conditional statement symbolically.\nLet A = \"The alien visited Mars\"\nLet B = \"The robot visited Jupiter\"\nThe conditional statement can be written as: A \u2192 B (If A is true, then B is true)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the negation of the consequent.\nThe negation of the consequent is: \u00acB (The robot did not visit Jupiter)\n\nStep 3: Use the logical reasoning principle.\nIn logic, if the conditional statement (A \u2192 B) is true, and the consequent (B) is false (\u00acB), then we can infer that the antecedent (A) must also be false (\u00acA).\n\nStep 4: Apply the reasoning to the given information.\nSince the conditional statement (A \u2192 B) is given, and we know that the consequent (B) is false (\u00acB), we can infer that the antecedent (A) must also be false (\u00acA).\n\nTherefore, if the robot did not visit Jupiter, and the conditional statement \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" is true, we can logically conclude that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes"
