            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to use the rules of logic and conditional statements.\n\nGiven information:\n- If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. (Conditional statement)\n- The pants were not denim. (Negation of the consequent)\n\nStep 1: Represent the conditional statement symbolically.\nLet P be \"the shirt was cotton,\" and Q be \"the pants were denim.\"\nThe conditional statement can be written as: P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the negation of the consequent.\nThe negation of the consequent (Q) is given as \"The pants were not denim,\" which is represented as \u00acQ.\n\nStep 3: Use the logical reasoning process.\nIn classical logic, the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ) does not allow us to infer the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP). This is known as the \"Fallacy of Denying the Antecedent.\"\n\nIn other words, if the conditional statement P \u2192 Q is true, and we know that Q is false (\u00acQ), we cannot conclude that P is false (\u00acP).\n\nStep 4: Determine the answer.\nSince we cannot infer the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP) from the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ), we cannot conclude that \"the shirt was not cotton\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
