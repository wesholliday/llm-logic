Kate did not eat salad.\n\nStep 1: Represent the statements using propositional logic.\nLet P = \"Ben ate pasta\"\nLet Q = \"Kate ate salad\"\n\nThe first statement can be represented as: P \u2192 Q (If P is true, then Q is true)\nThe second statement can be represented as: \u00acQ (Q is false, or not Q)\n\nStep 2: Use the law of contrapositive in propositional logic.\nThe contrapositive of the conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) is (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP).\n\nStep 3: Combine the given statements using logical inference.\nFrom the second statement, we have \u00acQ (Kate did not eat salad).\nUsing the contrapositive of the first statement, we can infer \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP (If Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta).\n\nStep 4: Draw the conclusion.\nSince we have \u00acQ (Kate did not eat salad) and the implication \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP (If Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta), we can conclude that \u00acP (Ben did not eat pasta) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
