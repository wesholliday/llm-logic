If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n2. The book is not a mystery novel.\n\nStep 1: Represent the statements using propositional logic.\nLet p = \"The book was written by James\"\nLet q = \"The book is a mystery novel\"\n\nThe first statement can be represented as: p \u2192 q (If p is true, then q is true)\nThe second statement can be represented as: \u00acq (q is false)\n\nStep 2: Use the rules of logical inference to derive the conclusion.\nWe know that if the premise (p \u2192 q) is true and the consequent (q) is false, then the antecedent (p) must be false.\n\nThis can be represented using the Modus Tollens rule:\n(p \u2192 q) \u2227 (\u00acq) \u21d2 (\u00acp)\n\nSubstituting the statements:\n(p \u2192 q) \u2227 (\u00acq) \u21d2 (\u00acp)\n[(p \u2192 q) \u2227 \u00acq] \u21d2 \u00acp\n\nSince we have (p \u2192 q) from the first statement and \u00acq from the second statement, we can conclude that \u00acp is true, which means \"The book was not written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
