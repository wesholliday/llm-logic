If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n2. The truck was not metal.\n\nStep 1: Represent the statements using propositional logic.\nLet p = \"The doll was plastic\"\nLet q = \"The truck was metal\"\n\nThe first statement can be written as: p \u2192 q (If p is true, then q is true)\nThe second statement can be written as: \u00acq (q is false, or not q)\n\nStep 2: Use the rules of logical inference to derive the conclusion.\nWe have:\np \u2192 q (If p, then q)\n\u00acq (Not q)\n\nUsing the modus tollens rule (If p \u2192 q is true, and q is false, then p must be false), we can conclude:\n\u00acp (Not p)\n\nStep 3: Interpret the conclusion in terms of the original statements.\n\u00acp means \"The doll was not plastic.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
