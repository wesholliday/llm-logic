If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n2. Amy did not play tennis.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\n\"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\"\nThis is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\"\nIn this case, A is \"Jeff played basketball,\" and B is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\n\"Amy did not play tennis.\"\nThis statement directly contradicts the consequent (B) of the conditional statement in the first statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply the logical rule of denying the consequent.\nIf the consequent (B) of a conditional statement is false, we cannot make any definite conclusion about the antecedent (A).\n\nIn this case, since \"Amy did not play tennis\" (the consequent is false), we cannot definitively conclude whether \"Jeff played basketball\" (the antecedent) is true or false.\n\nStep 4: Determine the answer.\nSince we cannot make a definite conclusion about the antecedent based on the given information, we cannot infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: no"
