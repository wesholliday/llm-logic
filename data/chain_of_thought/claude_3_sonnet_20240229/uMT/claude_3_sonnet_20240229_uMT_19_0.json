            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to use the rules of logic and conditional statements.\n\nGiven information:\n- If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. (Conditional statement)\n- Jen did not watch basketball. (Negation of the consequent)\n\nStep 1: Represent the conditional statement symbolically.\nLet p = \"Tom watched football\"\nLet q = \"Jen watched basketball\"\nThe conditional statement can be written as: p \u2192 q (If p is true, then q is true)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the negation of the consequent.\nThe negation of the consequent is: \u00acq (Jen did not watch basketball)\n\nStep 3: Use the logical reasoning process.\nIn propositional logic, the negation of the consequent (\u00acq) does not allow us to infer the negation of the antecedent (\u00acp) in a conditional statement (p \u2192 q).\n\nIn other words, if the conditional statement \"If p, then q\" is true, and we know that q is false (\u00acq), we cannot conclude that p is false (\u00acp). This is known as the \"fallacy of denying the consequent.\"\n\nStep 4: Determine the answer based on the logical reasoning.\nSince we cannot infer the negation of the antecedent (\u00acp) from the negation of the consequent (\u00acq) in a conditional statement, we cannot conclude that Tom did not watch football based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
