(Conditional statement)\n- The unicorn was not in the forest. (Negation of the consequent)\n\nStep 1: Represent the conditional statement symbolically.\nLet P = \"The griffin was in the forest\"\nLet Q = \"The unicorn was in the forest\"\nThe conditional statement can be written as: P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the negation of the consequent.\nThe negation of the consequent (Q) is given as true: \u00acQ (The unicorn was not in the forest)\n\nStep 3: Use the logical reasoning principle.\nIn classical logic, the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ) does not allow us to infer the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP) from a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q).\n\nIn other words, if we have \"If P, then Q\" and we know that \"not Q\" is true, we cannot conclude that \"not P\" is true. This is known as the \"fallacy of denying the antecedent.\"\n\nAnswer: no\n\nWe cannot infer that the griffin was not in the forest based on the given information. The negation of the consequent (the unicorn was not in the forest) does not logically imply the negation of the antecedent (the griffin was not in the forest)."
