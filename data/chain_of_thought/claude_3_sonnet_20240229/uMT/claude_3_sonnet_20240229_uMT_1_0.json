            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to use the rules of logic and conditional statements.\n\nGiven information:\n- If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. (Conditional statement)\n- Sue was not at the wedding. (Negation of the consequent)\n\nStep 1: Represent the conditional statement symbolically.\nLet P = \"Mary was at the wedding\"\nLet Q = \"Sue was at the wedding\"\nThe conditional statement can be written as: P \u2192 Q (If P is true, then Q is true)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the negation of the consequent.\nWe know that Sue was not at the wedding, which means Q is false.\n\nStep 3: Apply the logical reasoning.\nIn classical logic, the negation of the consequent (Q is false) does not allow us to infer anything about the truth value of the antecedent (P). In other words, if the consequent is false, the antecedent can be either true or false.\n\nStep 4: Draw the conclusion.\nSince we cannot determine the truth value of P (whether Mary was at the wedding or not) based on the given information, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no"
