In other words, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nStep 1: Identify the components of the given statement.\nA = \"The fribble was snurgled.\"\nB = \"The fribble crinked.\"\n\nStep 2: Negate both components to form the contrapositive.\nNot B = \"The fribble did not crink.\"\nNot A = \"The fribble was not snurgled.\"\n\nStep 3: Construct the contrapositive statement.\n\"If not B, then not A.\"\n\"If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
