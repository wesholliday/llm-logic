            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and apply the rules of logical inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\"\n2. \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. It states that if the condition \"Jeff played basketball\" is true, then the consequence \"Amy played tennis\" must also be true.\n\nThe second statement directly affirms the consequence \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\nIf the conditional statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is true, and we know that \"Amy played tennis\" is true, we cannot conclusively infer that \"Jeff played basketball\" is true.\n\nThe reason for this is that the conditional statement only guarantees the truth of the consequence (\"Amy played tennis\") if the condition (\"Jeff played basketball\") is true. However, it does not provide any information about the condition itself.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement alone does not allow us to conclude the truth of the condition based solely on the truth of the consequence.\n\nAnswer: no"
