This is known as the \"modus ponens\" rule of inference.\n\nIn our case, we have the conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" and the premise \"Bob chose pasta\" (Q is true).\n\nStep 4: Draw the conclusion.\nBy applying the modus ponens rule, we can conclude that \"Sue chose pizza\" (P is true) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
