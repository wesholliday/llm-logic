            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n2. \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. It has the form:\nIf A (antecedent), then B (consequent).\n\nThe second statement affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn propositional logic, affirming the consequent of a conditional statement is a fallacy and does not allow us to conclude the antecedent (A).\n\nIn other words, from the given statements, we cannot logically conclude that \"Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The first statement establishes a conditional relationship: If Mary was at the wedding (A), then Sue was at the wedding (B).\n2. The second statement affirms the consequent (B): Sue was at the wedding.\n3. However, affirming the consequent (B) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (A).\n4. There could be other reasons or conditions that led to Sue being at the wedding, even if Mary was not there.\n5. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that \"Mary was at the wedding\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
