            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n2. \"The banana was yellow.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. It has the form:\nIf A (the apple was red), then B (the banana was yellow).\n\nThe second statement affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn propositional logic, affirming the consequent of a conditional statement does not allow us to conclude the antecedent (A). This is known as the \"fallacy of affirming the consequent,\" and it is an invalid form of reasoning.\n\nTo illustrate this, consider the following example:\n\"If it rains, then the ground will be wet.\"\n\"The ground is wet.\"\nWe cannot conclude from these statements that \"it rained,\" because there could be other reasons for the ground being wet (e.g., a sprinkler system, a spill, etc.).\n\nSimilarly, in our case, even though we know that \"the banana was yellow,\" we cannot conclude that \"the apple was red\" based solely on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
