It has the form:\nIf A (antecedent), then B (consequent).\n\nThe second statement affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn propositional logic, affirming the consequent of a conditional statement does not allow us to conclude the antecedent. In other words, from the given statements, we cannot logically infer that \"Joe went to the park.\"\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The first statement establishes a sufficient condition for Lucy going to the zoo: If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n2. The second statement confirms that Lucy went to the zoo.\n3. However, there could be other reasons or conditions that led to Lucy going to the zoo, not necessarily Joe going to the park.\n4. The given statements do not provide enough information to conclude that Joe went to the park.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example:\nIf it rains, then the ground will be wet.\nThe ground is wet.\nFrom these statements, we cannot conclude that it rained, as there could be other reasons for the ground being wet (e.g., a sprinkler system, a spill, etc.).\n\nAnswer: no"
