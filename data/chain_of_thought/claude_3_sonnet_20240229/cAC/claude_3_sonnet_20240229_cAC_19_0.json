It states that if the condition \"Tom watched football\" is true, then the consequence \"Jen watched basketball\" must also be true.\n\nThe second statement directly affirms the consequence \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\nIf the conditional statement is true, and the consequence is true, then we can conclude that the condition must also be true. This is known as the \"modus ponens\" rule of inference.\n\nIn this case, if we assume that the conditional statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is true, and we know that \"Jen watched basketball\" is true, then we can logically conclude that \"Tom watched football\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
