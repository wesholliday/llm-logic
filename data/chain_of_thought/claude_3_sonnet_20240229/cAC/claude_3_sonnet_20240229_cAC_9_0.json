            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and apply the rules of logical inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n2. \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nWe need to determine if the conclusion \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" logically follows from these premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the first statement.\nThe statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt,\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\nThe statement \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" affirms the consequent (Q) of the conditional statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply the logical reasoning.\nIn propositional logic, affirming the consequent (Q) of a conditional statement (\"If P, then Q\") does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (P). In other words, if we know that \"If P, then Q\" is true, and we know that Q is true, we cannot conclude that P is true.\n\nStep 4: Draw the conclusion.\nSince affirming the consequent is an invalid argument form, we cannot logically conclude \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
