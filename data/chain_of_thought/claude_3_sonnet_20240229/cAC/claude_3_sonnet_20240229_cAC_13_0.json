            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\"\n2. \"The truck was blue.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the car was red,\" and B is \"the truck was blue.\"\n\nThe second statement affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn propositional logic, affirming the consequent of a conditional statement does not allow us to conclude the antecedent (A). In other words, from \"If A, then B\" and \"B\" being true, we cannot logically infer that \"A\" is true.\n\nThis is because there could be other reasons or conditions that lead to \"B\" being true, independent of \"A\" being true.\n\nAnswer: no"
