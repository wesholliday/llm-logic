In other words, if we know that \"B\" is true, we cannot logically conclude that \"A\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: No\n\nWe cannot logically conclude \"The dog was inside\" from the given statements. The affirmation of the consequent (\"The cat was outside\") does not guarantee the truth of the antecedent (\"The dog was inside\"). There could be other reasons or conditions that led to the cat being outside, independent of the dog's location."
