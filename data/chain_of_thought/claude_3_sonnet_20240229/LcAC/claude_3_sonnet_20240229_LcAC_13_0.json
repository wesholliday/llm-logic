In other words, if we know that \"B\" is true, we cannot logically conclude that \"A\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nThe given statements do not allow us to logically conclude that \"The car was red.\" While we know that \"The truck was blue,\" this information alone is insufficient to determine the truth value of the antecedent \"The car was red\" in the conditional statement."
