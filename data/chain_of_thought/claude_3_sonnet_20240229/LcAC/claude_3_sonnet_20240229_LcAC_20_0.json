In other words, if we know that \"B is true,\" we cannot conclude that \"A is true\" based solely on the conditional statement \"If A, then B.\"\n\nAnswer: no\n\nThe given statements do not logically allow us to conclude that \"The apple was red.\" The fact that the banana was yellow does not necessarily imply that the apple was red, as there could be other reasons for the banana being yellow that are not related to the color of the apple."
