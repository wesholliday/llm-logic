This is because the truth of the consequent (C) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (A) in a conditional statement.\n\nIn other words, the structure \"If A, then C\" and \"C is true\" does not allow us to logically infer \"A is true.\"\n\nTo illustrate this, consider the following example:\n\"If it rains, then the ground will be wet.\"\n\"The ground is wet.\"\nFrom these statements, we cannot conclude that \"It rained,\" because there could be other reasons for the ground being wet (e.g., sprinklers, spilled water, etc.).\n\nAnswer: no"
