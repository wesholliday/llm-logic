            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n2. \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"Mary was at the wedding,\" and B is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe second statement affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn propositional logic, affirming the consequent of a conditional statement does not allow us to conclude the antecedent (A). In other words, from \"If A, then B\" and \"B,\" we cannot logically infer \"A.\"\n\nTo illustrate this, consider the following example:\n\"If it rains, then the ground will be wet.\"\n\"The ground is wet.\"\nFrom these statements, we cannot conclude that it rained because there could be other reasons for the ground being wet, such as a sprinkler system or a spill.\n\nSimilarly, in the given problem, from \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and \"Sue was at the wedding,\" we cannot logically conclude \"Mary was at the wedding\" because there could be other reasons for Sue being at the wedding that are not related to Mary's presence.\n\nAnswer: no"
