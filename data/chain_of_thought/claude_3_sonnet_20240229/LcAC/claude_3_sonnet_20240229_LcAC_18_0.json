            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and apply the rules of logical inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\n2. \"The truck was metal.\"\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the first statement.\nThe statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the doll was plastic,\" and Q is \"the truck was metal.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the truth values of the given statements.\nThe second statement, \"The truck was metal,\" affirms the consequent (Q) of the conditional statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply the logical reasoning.\nIn propositional logic, affirming the consequent (Q) of a conditional statement (\"If P, then Q\") does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (P). In other words, if we know that \"Q\" is true, we cannot conclude that \"P\" must also be true.\n\nStep 4: Determine the conclusion.\nSince affirming the consequent is an invalid argument form, we cannot logically conclude \"The doll was plastic\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
