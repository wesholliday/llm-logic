            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\"\n2. \"The pants were denim.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the shirt was cotton,\" and B is \"the pants were denim.\"\n\nThe second statement affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn propositional logic, affirming the consequent of a conditional statement does not allow us to conclude the antecedent (A). In other words, if we know that \"If A, then B\" is true, and we know that B is true, we cannot logically conclude that A is true.\n\nThis is because there could be other reasons or conditions that lead to B being true, independent of A being true.\n\nAnswer: no"
