However, it does not provide any information about the truth value of the antecedent (p) itself.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement (q).\nThis statement affirms that the consequent (q) is true, but it does not provide any information about the antecedent (p).\n\nStep 3: Check if we can logically conclude \"p\" from the given statements.\nThe truth of the consequent (q) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (p) in a conditional statement. In other words, even though we know that \"the book is a mystery novel\" (q is true), we cannot logically conclude that \"the book was written by James\" (p is true) based solely on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nThe given statements do not provide enough information to logically conclude that \"the book was written by James.\" The conditional statement only guarantees that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. However, it does not rule out the possibility that the mystery novel was written by someone else."
