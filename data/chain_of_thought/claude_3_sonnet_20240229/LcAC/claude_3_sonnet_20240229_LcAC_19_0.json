            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and apply the rules of logical inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\"\n2. \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. It states that if the antecedent (Tom watched football) is true, then the consequent (Jen watched basketball) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement affirms the consequent (Jen watched basketball) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn propositional logic, affirming the consequent of a conditional statement does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent. In other words, from the given statements, we cannot logically conclude that \"Tom watched football.\"\n\nTo illustrate this, consider the following example:\n\"If it rains, then the ground will be wet.\"\n\"The ground is wet.\"\nFrom these statements, we cannot conclude that \"It rained,\" because there could be other reasons for the ground being wet, such as a sprinkler system or a spill.\n\nSimilarly, in the given problem, the fact that Jen watched basketball does not necessarily mean that Tom watched football. There could be other reasons for Jen to watch basketball that are not related to Tom watching football.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\"\n2. The second statement affirms the consequent: \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n3. In propositional logic, affirming the consequent of a conditional statement does not imply the truth of the antecedent.\n4. Therefore, from the given statements, we cannot logically conclude that \"Tom watched football.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
