In an implication, the conclusion (M) follows from the premise (V). However, the converse is not necessarily true. In other words, if the conclusion (M) is true, we cannot definitively conclude that the premise (V) is also true.\n\nIn this case, we have the conclusion (M) as a given statement, but we cannot use it to infer the premise (V) based solely on the implication (V \u2192 M).\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. We have the implication: V \u2192 M (If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake)\n2. We also have the statement: M (The mummy was awake)\n3. However, from the implication (V \u2192 M) and the statement M, we cannot logically conclude V (The vampire was awake).\n\nAnswer: no"
