            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The snork might be plonk' is a possibility statement, indicating that the snork being plonk is one of the possible scenarios. The statement 'The snork might be plonk or wobble' is a disjunctive statement, which means that it covers two possible scenarios: the snork being plonk or the snork wobbling.\n\nSince the original statement only mentions the possibility of the snork being plonk, we cannot logically infer the additional possibility of the snork wobbling from it. The second statement introduces a new possibility that is not covered by the first statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
