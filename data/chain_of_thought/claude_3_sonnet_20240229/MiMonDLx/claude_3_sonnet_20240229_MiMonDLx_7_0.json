            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The frazzle might be wozzle' does not provide any information about whether 'The frazzle might be wozzle or on flump' is true or not. The original statement only states that the frazzle might be wozzle, but it does not rule out the possibility that the frazzle might also be on flump. To infer the second statement from the first, we would need additional information or context that explicitly excludes the possibility of the frazzle being on flump.\n\nAnswer: yes"
