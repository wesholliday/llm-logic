It has the form:\n\nIf P (antecedent), then Q (consequent).\n\nIn this case, P is \"Ben ate pasta,\" and Q is \"Kate ate the salad.\"\n\nThe second statement affirms the antecedent (P) of the conditional statement.\n\nAccording to the rules of inference, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, then we can validly infer that Q is also true.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. We have the conditional statement: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\"\n2. We also know that \"Ben ate pasta\" is true.\n3. Since the antecedent (\"Ben ate pasta\") of the conditional statement is true, and the conditional statement is assumed to be true, we can infer that the consequent (\"Kate ate the salad\") must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can logically infer that \"Kate ate the salad.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
