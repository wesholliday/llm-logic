It has the form:\n\nIf P (antecedent), then Q (consequent).\n\nIn this case, P is \"Jeff played basketball,\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nThe second statement affirms the antecedent (P) of the conditional statement.\n\nAccording to the rules of inference for conditional statements, if the antecedent (P) is true, and the conditional statement (If P, then Q) is true, then we can infer that the consequent (Q) is also true.\n\nStep 1: Identify the antecedent (P) and consequent (Q) in the conditional statement.\nP: Jeff played basketball\nQ: Amy played tennis\n\nStep 2: Check if the antecedent (P) is true based on the given information.\nThe second statement affirms that \"Jeff played basketball,\" which means P is true.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rule of inference for conditional statements.\nIf P is true, and the conditional statement (If P, then Q) is true, then Q must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"Amy played tennis\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
