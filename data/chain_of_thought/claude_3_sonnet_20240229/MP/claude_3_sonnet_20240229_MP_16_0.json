            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\"\n2. \"The shirt was cotton.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. It has the form:\n\nIf A (the shirt was cotton), then B (the pants were denim).\n\nThe second statement affirms the antecedent (A) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn propositional logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, then we can validly infer that B is also true.\n\nStep 1: Identify the conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\"\nStep 2: Identify the affirmed antecedent: \"The shirt was cotton.\"\nStep 3: Apply the rule of inference: If the antecedent of a conditional statement is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can validly infer that \"The pants were denim.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
