It has the form:\n\nIf [condition], then [consequence].\n\nIn this case, the condition is \"Mary was at the wedding,\" and the consequence is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe second statement affirms the condition of the first statement, which is \"Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\nAccording to the rules of inference for conditional statements, if the condition (antecedent) of a conditional statement is true, and the conditional statement itself is true, then we can infer that the consequence (consequent) must also be true.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n1. The condition \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true (given in the second statement).\n2. The conditional statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is true (given in the first statement).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the consequence \"Sue was at the wedding\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
