It has the form:\nIf A (the bear was in the cave), then B (the wolf was in the den).\n\nThe second statement affirms the antecedent (A) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn propositional logic, if the antecedent (A) of a conditional statement (If A, then B) is true, and the conditional statement itself is true, then we can validly infer the consequent (B).\n\nIn this case, we have:\n1. The antecedent (A): \"The bear was in the cave\" is true.\n2. The conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" is given as true.\n\nTherefore, we can validly infer the consequent (B): \"The wolf was in the den.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
