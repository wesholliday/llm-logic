The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\"\n2. The second statement affirms the antecedent: \"The car was red.\"\n3. Since the antecedent is true, and the conditional statement is given as true, we can validly infer the consequent.\n\nAnswer: yes"
