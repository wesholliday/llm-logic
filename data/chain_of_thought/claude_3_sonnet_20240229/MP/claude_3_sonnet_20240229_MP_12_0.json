It has the form:\n\nIf [antecedent], then [consequent].\n\nIn this case, the antecedent is \"Joe went to the park,\" and the consequent is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nThe second statement affirms the antecedent of the conditional statement.\n\nAccording to the rules of inference, if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, then we can infer that B is also true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can logically infer that \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
