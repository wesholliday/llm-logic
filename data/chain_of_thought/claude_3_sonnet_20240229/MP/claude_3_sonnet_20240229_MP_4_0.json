It has the form:\n\nIf A (antecedent), then B (consequent).\n\nIn this case, A is \"the alien visited Mars,\" and B is \"the robot visited Jupiter.\"\n\nThe second statement affirms the antecedent (A) of the conditional statement.\n\nAccording to the rules of inference, if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, then we can validly infer that B is also true.\n\nStep 1: Identify the conditional statement: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\"\nStep 2: Identify the affirmed antecedent: \"The alien visited Mars.\"\nStep 3: Apply the rule of inference: If the antecedent (A) of a conditional statement is true, and the conditional statement is true, then the consequent (B) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can validly infer that \"The robot visited Jupiter.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
