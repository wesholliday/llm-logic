It has the form:\n\nIf A (the dog was inside), then B (the cat was outside).\n\nThe second statement affirms the antecedent (A) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn propositional logic, when the antecedent (A) of a conditional statement (If A, then B) is true, and the conditional statement itself is true, we can validly infer the consequent (B) using the rule of modus ponens.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n1. If the dog was inside (A), then the cat was outside (B).\n2. The dog was inside (A is true).\n\nTherefore, we can infer:\nAnswer: yes\n\nThe cat was outside (B is true)."
