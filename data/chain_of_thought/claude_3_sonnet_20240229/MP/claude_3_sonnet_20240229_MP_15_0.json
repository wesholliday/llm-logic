It has the form:\n\nIf [condition], then [consequence].\n\nIn this case, the condition is \"Sam took a plane,\" and the consequence is \"Erin took a train.\"\n\nThe second statement affirms the condition of the first statement.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"Erin took a train\" from these statements, we need to apply the rule of modus ponens, which states:\n\nIf the conditional statement is true, and the condition (antecedent) is true, then the consequence (consequent) must also be true.\n\nIn our case, the conditional statement (\"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\") is given as true, and the condition (\"Sam took a plane\") is also true.\n\nTherefore, by applying modus ponens, we can logically infer that the consequence (\"Erin took a train\") must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
