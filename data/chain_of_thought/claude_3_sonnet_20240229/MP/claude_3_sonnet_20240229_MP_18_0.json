            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\n2. \"The doll was plastic.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. It has the form:\n\nIf A (the doll was plastic), then B (the truck was metal).\n\nThe second statement affirms the antecedent (A) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn propositional logic, when the antecedent (A) of a conditional statement (If A, then B) is true, and the conditional statement itself is true, then we can infer that the consequent (B) must also be true.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The first statement establishes a conditional relationship: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\n2. The second statement affirms the antecedent (the doll was plastic) of the conditional statement.\n3. Since the antecedent is true, and the conditional statement is assumed to be true, we can apply the rule of inference known as \"Modus Ponens\" or \"Affirming the Antecedent.\"\n4. According to the rule of Modus Ponens, if the antecedent (A) is true, and the conditional statement (If A, then B) is true, then the consequent (B) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
