It has the form:\nIf A (the vampire was awake), then B (the mummy was awake).\n\nThe second statement affirms the antecedent (A) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn propositional logic, if the antecedent (A) of a conditional statement (If A, then B) is true, and the conditional statement itself is true, then we can infer that the consequent (B) must also be true.\n\nStep 1: Identify the antecedent (A) and consequent (B) in the conditional statement.\nA: The vampire was awake.\nB: The mummy was awake.\n\nStep 2: Check if the antecedent (A) is true.\nThe second statement affirms that \"The vampire was awake,\" which means the antecedent (A) is true.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rule of inference for conditional statements.\nIf the antecedent (A) is true, and the conditional statement (If A, then B) is true, then the consequent (B) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes\n\nSince the antecedent \"The vampire was awake\" is true, and the conditional statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is given as true, we can logically infer that \"The mummy was awake\" is also true."
