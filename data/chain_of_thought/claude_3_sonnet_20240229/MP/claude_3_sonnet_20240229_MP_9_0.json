            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n2. \"Lisa bought the red shirt.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. It has the form:\n\nIf [condition], then [consequence].\n\nIn this case, the condition is \"Lisa bought the red shirt,\" and the consequence is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThe second statement affirms the condition of the first statement.\n\nTo determine if we can infer the consequence from the conditional statement and the affirmed condition, we need to apply the rule of modus ponens, which states:\n\nIf the conditional statement is true, and the condition (antecedent) is true, then the consequence (consequent) must also be true.\n\nIn our case, the conditional statement is true (given), and the condition \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is also true (given).\n\nTherefore, by applying modus ponens, we can logically infer the consequence, which is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
