            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statements and apply the rules of inference.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\"\n2. \"The cake was chocolate.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. It has the form:\n\nIf A (the cake was chocolate), then B (the muffins were blueberry).\n\nThe second statement affirms the antecedent (A) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn propositional logic, if the antecedent (A) of a conditional statement (If A, then B) is true, and the conditional statement itself is true, then we can infer that the consequent (B) must also be true.\n\nStep 1: Identify the antecedent (A) and consequent (B) in the conditional statement.\nA: \"The cake was chocolate.\"\nB: \"The muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nStep 2: Check if the antecedent (A) is true.\nThe second statement affirms that \"The cake was chocolate,\" which is the antecedent (A) of the conditional statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rule of inference (modus ponens).\nIf the antecedent (A) is true, and the conditional statement (If A, then B) is true, then the consequent (B) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that \"The muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
