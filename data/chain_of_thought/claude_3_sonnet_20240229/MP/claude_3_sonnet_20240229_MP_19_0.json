It has the form:\n\nIf [antecedent], then [consequent].\n\nIn this case, the antecedent is \"Tom watched football,\" and the consequent is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nThe second statement affirms the antecedent of the conditional statement.\n\nAccording to the rules of inference for conditional statements, if the antecedent is true, and the conditional statement is true, then we can infer that the consequent is also true.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n1. The antecedent (\"Tom watched football\") is true.\n2. The conditional statement (\"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\") is given as true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the consequent (\"Jen watched basketball\") is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
