It has the form:\nIf A (antecedent), then B (consequent).\n\nIn this case:\nA: \"The griffin was in the forest.\"\nB: \"The unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\nThe second statement affirms the antecedent (A) of the conditional statement.\n\nAccording to the rules of inference, if the antecedent of a conditional statement is true, and the conditional statement itself is true, then we can infer that the consequent must also be true.\n\nIn other words, if we have:\n1. If A, then B.\n2. A is true.\nThen, we can conclude that B must be true.\n\nApplying this to our problem:\n1. If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. (Given)\n2. The griffin was in the forest. (Given)\n\nTherefore, we can infer:\nThe unicorn was in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes"
