This rule of inference is known as Modus Ponens.\n\nStep 4: Draw the conclusion.\nSince we have the conditional statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" (P \u2192 Q), and the premise \"Alex finished the race\" (P), we can apply Modus Ponens to infer that \"Chris finished the race\" (Q) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
