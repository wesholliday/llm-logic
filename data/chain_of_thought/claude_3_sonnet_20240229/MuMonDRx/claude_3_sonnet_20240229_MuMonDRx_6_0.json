The original statement asserts that the zibber must be a specific thing, which is 'fizzle zibber'. However, the second statement introduces an additional option, 'bimboozle', which is not mentioned or implied in the original statement. Without any additional context or information, we cannot conclude that the zibber must be either 'bimboozle' or 'fizzle zibber' based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
