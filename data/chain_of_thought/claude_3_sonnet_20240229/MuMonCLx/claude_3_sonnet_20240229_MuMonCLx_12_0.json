This phrase is a part of the larger statement, and it does not contain any additional conditions or qualifiers. Therefore, we can reasonably infer that if the larger statement is true, then the shorter phrase 'The wibble must be quork by fizzle' must also be true, as it is a subset of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
