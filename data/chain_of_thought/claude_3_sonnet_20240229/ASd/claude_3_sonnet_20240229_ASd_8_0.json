The original statement only guarantees that the package will arrive today if it has shipped, without any additional conditions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no\n\nWe cannot infer the statement \"If the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today\" from the original statement \"If the package has shipped, then it will arrive today.\""
