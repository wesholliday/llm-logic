It simply states that if the phone is charged, it will have power, regardless of the battery's state.\n\nTherefore, the second statement does not necessarily follow from the first statement. The additional condition (C: it has a dead battery) may or may not affect the conclusion (B: it will have power) when combined with the original condition (A: I charge my phone).\n\nAnswer: no"
