            "content": "To answer this question, we need to analyze the logical structure of the given statements.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If I finish my homework, I can play video games.\"\n\nThis is a simple conditional statement, where the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is \"I finish my homework,\" and the consequent (the \"then\" part) is \"I can play video games.\"\n\nThe proposed inference is: \"If I finish my homework and my computer catches on fire, I can play video games.\"\n\nThis statement adds an additional condition to the antecedent, which is \"my computer catches on fire.\"\n\nIn propositional logic, adding an additional condition to the antecedent of a conditional statement does not necessarily preserve the truth of the original statement.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The original statement establishes a sufficient condition for playing video games, which is finishing homework.\n2. The proposed inference adds an extra condition (computer catching on fire) to the antecedent.\n3. If the computer catches on fire, it may prevent the ability to play video games, even if the homework is finished.\n4. Therefore, the proposed inference is not logically valid because it introduces an additional condition that could potentially contradict the consequent (being able to play video games).\n\nAnswer: no"
