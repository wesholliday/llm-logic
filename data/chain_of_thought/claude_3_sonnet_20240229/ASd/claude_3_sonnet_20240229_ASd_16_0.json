It simply states that if the lawn is fertilized, it will be lush and green.\n\nHowever, the presence of a drought could potentially negate the effect of fertilization, as drought conditions may prevent the lawn from receiving sufficient water, which is essential for lush and green growth.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer the new statement from the original statement because the original statement does not account for the additional condition of a drought.\n\nAnswer: no"
