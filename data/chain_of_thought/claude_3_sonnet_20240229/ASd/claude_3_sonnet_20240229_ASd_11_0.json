However, the rule does not allow us to add additional conditions to the premise and still guarantee the conclusion.\n\nIn this case, adding the condition \"and do hard labor\" to the premise changes the meaning of the statement. Getting enough sleep may prevent tiredness, but doing hard labor could potentially cause tiredness, even if you've had enough sleep.\n\nTherefore, the inference is not valid because we cannot logically conclude that \"If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired\" from the given statement \"If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
