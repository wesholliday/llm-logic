This is a conditional statement that says going to the concert is sufficient for having a good time.\n3. However, it does not say that going to the concert is necessary for having a good time. There could be other ways to have a good time.\n4. The new statement adds an additional condition: \"If we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time.\"\n5. This new statement is much stronger than the original, as it implies that even if a bomb goes off at the concert, we'll still have a good time.\n6. The original statement does not provide enough information to logically infer the new statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
