            "content": "To answer this question, we need to analyze the logical structure of the given statements and determine if the second statement follows logically from the first.\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical form of the first statement.\nThe statement \"If I water the plants, they will grow\" has the logical form:\nIf A (I water the plants), then B (they will grow).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\nThe statement \"If I water the plants and there is no sunlight, they will grow\" has the logical form:\nIf A (I water the plants) and C (there is no sunlight), then B (they will grow).\n\nStep 3: Determine if the second statement follows logically from the first.\nThe first statement establishes a sufficient condition for B (they will grow) to occur, which is A (I water the plants). However, it does not specify whether other conditions, such as the presence or absence of sunlight, are necessary or not.\n\nThe second statement adds an additional condition, C (there is no sunlight), along with A (I water the plants), as a requirement for B (they will grow) to occur.\n\nSince the first statement does not explicitly state whether sunlight is necessary or not, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
