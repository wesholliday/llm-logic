This is a negation of \"The fleeg must be surned\".\n\n2) The second premise is \"Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered\". This is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the two statements must be true.\n\n3) If we negate the first part of the disjunction (\"The fleeg must be surned\") using the first premise, then the only remaining possibility is the second part (\"It is bluttered\").\n\n4) Therefore, from the two given premises, we can logically infer that \"The fleeg is bluttered\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
