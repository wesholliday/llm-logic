Then, use the rules of logic to derive a contradiction.\nAssumptions:\n\u00ac(whiffle \u2192 tinked)\n(whiffle \u2192 tinked) \u2228 shanked\n\u00acshanked\n\nStep 3: From the second premise, we know that either (whiffle \u2192 tinked) is true or shanked is true.\nSince we assumed \u00acshanked, it follows that (whiffle \u2192 tinked) must be true.\n\nStep 4: However, from the first premise, we know that \u00ac(whiffle \u2192 tinked) is true.\n\nStep 5: We have derived a contradiction: (whiffle \u2192 tinked) and \u00ac(whiffle \u2192 tinked) cannot both be true.\n\nStep 6: Since we arrived at a contradiction by assuming the negated conclusion, we can conclude that the original conclusion must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
