Assume the opposite of what we want to prove: \u00acQ (The grommet is not sploffed)\n2. From Premise 2 (P \u2228 Q) and the assumption \u00acQ, we can infer P (The grommet must be plopped) using the disjunctive syllogism rule.\n3. However, this conclusion (P) contradicts Premise 1 (\u00acP).\n4. Since we have derived a contradiction from the assumption \u00acQ and the given premises, we can conclude that the assumption must be false.\n5. Therefore, the negation of the assumption, which is Q (The grommet is sploffed), must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
