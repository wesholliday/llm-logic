The dog was inside.\n\nBased on the first statement, if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. This means that whenever the dog is inside, the cat cannot be inside. \n\nThe second statement tells us that the dog was indeed inside. \n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that the cat cannot be inside because whenever the dog is inside, the cat must be outside. \n\nTherefore, we can infer that the cat was outside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
