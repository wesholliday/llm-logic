This implies that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis. \n\nThe second statement states that Jeff played basketball. \n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that Jeff played basketball. However, we cannot definitively infer whether Amy played tennis or not. The first statement only establishes a condition, but it does not provide any information about whether Jeff actually played basketball or not. Therefore, we cannot make a conclusive inference about Amy playing tennis based on the given information. \n\nAnswer: No",
