In other words, we need to check if the argument is valid according to the rules of logical implication.\n\nUsing the truth table for the conditional statement (~P \u2192 Q), we can evaluate all possible truth value combinations of P and Q. If the conclusion (Q) is true whenever the premise (~P) is true, then the argument is logically valid.\n\nTruth Table:\n\n| P | Q | ~P | ~P \u2192 Q |\n|---|---|----|--------|\n| T | T | F  |   T    |\n| T | F | F  |   F    |\n| F | T | T  |   T    |\n| F | F | T  |   T    |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that whenever the premise (~P) is true, the conclusion (Q) is also true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
