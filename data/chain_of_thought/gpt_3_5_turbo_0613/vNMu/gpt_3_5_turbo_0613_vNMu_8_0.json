In other words, we need to check if \u00acA logically implies B.\n\nUsing a truth table, we can evaluate the logical relationship between \u00acA and B:\n\n| \u00acA | B |\n|----|---|\n| T  | T |\n| F  | T |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that when \u00acA is true, B is also true. However, when \u00acA is false, B can be either true or false.\n\nSince there is at least one case where \u00acA is false and B is true, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
