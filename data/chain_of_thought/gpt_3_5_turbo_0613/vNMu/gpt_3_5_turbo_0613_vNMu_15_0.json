This can be restated as 'It is possible that the shoes are not in the closet'. \n\nThe conclusion states 'The shoes might not be in the closet'. \n\nBy comparing the premise and the conclusion, we can see that they are saying essentially the same thing. Both statements express the possibility that the shoes are not in the closet. \n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
