In this case, the conclusion is the negation of the premise.\n\nIf the premise is true (\u00acP), then the conclusion (\u00acQ) must also be true. This is because if it is not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser, then it is possible that the watch is not charging on the dresser.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
