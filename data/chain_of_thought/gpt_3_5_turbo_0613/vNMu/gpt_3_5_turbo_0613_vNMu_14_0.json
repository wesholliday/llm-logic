This can be restated as 'It is possible that the milk is not on the counter'. \n\nThe conclusion states 'The milk might not be on the counter'. \n\nBy comparing the premise and the conclusion, we can see that they are saying essentially the same thing. Both statements express the possibility that the milk is not on the counter. \n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
