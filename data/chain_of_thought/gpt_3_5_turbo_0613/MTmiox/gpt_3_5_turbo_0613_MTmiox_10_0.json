This means that there is a chance that the wug was not subjected to garpling.\n\nFrom statement 2, we have a conditional statement. It states that if the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled. This means that if the wug underwent sproinging, it is guaranteed to have been garpled.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The wug was not sproinged\"?\n\nTo answer this, we need to examine the given statements. Statement 1 does not provide any information about whether the wug was sproinged or not. It only tells us that the wug might not have been garpled.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that if the wug was sproinged, it must have been garpled. However, it does not provide any information about whether the wug was actually sproinged or not.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot infer whether the wug was sproinged or not. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
