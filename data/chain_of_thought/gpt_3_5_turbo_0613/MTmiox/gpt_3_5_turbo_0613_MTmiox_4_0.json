It states that if the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot directly infer whether \"The fribble was not snurgled\" or not. The statements only provide information about the possibility of the fribble not crinking and the relationship between snurgling and crinking.",
