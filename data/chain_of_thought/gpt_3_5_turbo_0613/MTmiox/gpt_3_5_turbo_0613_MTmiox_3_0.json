However, this statement does not provide any information about whether the splat was morphed or not.\n\nStatement 2 introduces a conditional relationship between the splat being morphed and the splat quanking. It states that if the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked. However, it does not provide any information about whether the splat was actually morphed or not.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot directly infer whether the splat was morphed or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"The splat was not morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
