It states that if the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed.\n\nBased on these statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed.\n- The flug might not have been zimmed.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude whether the flug was blummed or not. The possibility remains that the flug was blummed but not zimmed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The flug was not blummed\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
