It does not provide any definitive information about whether the sprocket was daggled or not.\n\n2. \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled.\"\n   This statement establishes a conditional relationship. It states that if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled. However, it does not provide any information about whether the sprocket was actually cranked or not.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot directly infer whether \"The sprocket was not cranked\" or not. The information provided does not give us enough evidence to make a conclusive determination about the cranking of the sprocket.\n\nAnswer: No",
