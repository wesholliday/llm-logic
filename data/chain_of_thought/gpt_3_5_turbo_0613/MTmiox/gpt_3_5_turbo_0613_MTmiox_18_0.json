This means that there is a chance that the shank was not subjected to the action of being nugged.\n\nStatement 2 introduces a conditional relationship between being plooked and being nugged. It states that if the shank was plooked, then it must have been nugged. This means that if the shank underwent the action of being plooked, it is guaranteed to have been nugged.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The shank was not plooked\"?\n\nTo answer this, we need to evaluate the given statements. Statement 1 does not provide any direct information about whether the shank was plooked or not. It only suggests that it might not have been nugged.\n\nStatement 2, on the other hand, tells us that if the shank was plooked, it must have been nugged. However, it does not provide any information about whether the shank was actually plooked or not.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot definitively infer whether the shank was plooked or not. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
