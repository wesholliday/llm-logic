It states that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n3. \"The fleeg might not have been surned\" together with \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned\"\n\nFrom statement 3, we can infer that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned. However, we cannot conclude anything about whether the fleeg was bluttered or not based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The fleeg was not bluttered\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
