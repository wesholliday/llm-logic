This means that it is not certain whether the flugel was zargled or not.\n\nStatement 2 introduces a conditional relationship between being blimmed and being zargled. It states that if the flugel was blimmed, then it must have been zargled. However, it does not provide any information about whether the flugel was actually blimmed or not.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot definitively infer whether the flugel was blimmed or not. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The flugel was not blimmed\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
