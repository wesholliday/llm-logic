This means that tinking is not a certainty.\n\nFrom statement 2, we have a conditional statement. It states that if the whiffle was shanked, then it must have tinked. This implies that tinking is a necessary condition for shanking.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The whiffle was not shanked\"?\n\nIf the whiffle was shanked, then it must have tinked according to statement 2. However, statement 1 tells us that the whiffle might not have tinked. This means that there is a possibility that the whiffle was shanked and did not tink.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The whiffle was not shanked\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
