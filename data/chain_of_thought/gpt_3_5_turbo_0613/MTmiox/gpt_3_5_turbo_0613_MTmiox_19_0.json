This means that the smonk could have either plagged or not plagged.\n\nStatement 2 introduces a conditional statement: \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged.\" This means that if the smonk was vreebled, it is guaranteed that the smonk plagged.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\nIf the smonk was vreebled, then it must have plagged. However, we don't have any information about whether the smonk was vreebled or not. So, we cannot conclude anything about whether the smonk was vreebled or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The smonk was not vreebled\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
