This means that snugging is not guaranteed.\n\nFrom statement 2, we have a conditional statement. It states that if the clug was fleeked, then it must have been snugged. This implies that snugging is a necessary condition for fleeking.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The clug was not fleeked\"?\n\nTo answer this, we need to consider the possibilities:\n\n1. If the clug was snugged (as stated in statement 1), then we cannot infer whether it was fleeked or not because statement 2 only tells us about the relationship between fleeking and snugging, not the absence of fleeking.\n2. If the clug was not snugged (as stated in statement 1), then we still cannot infer whether it was fleeked or not because statement 2 only tells us about the relationship between fleeking and snugging, not the absence of fleeking.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot infer whether \"The clug was not fleeked\" or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
