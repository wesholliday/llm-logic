This means that if the zinger was fraggled, it cannot be not smoogled.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively infer that \"The zinger was not fraggled.\" The possibility remains that the zinger could have been fraggled, which would also mean it was smoogled. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
