It states that if the dreb was vroombed, then it must have been spened.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If the dreb was vroombed, then it must have been spened (from statement 2).\n- The dreb might not have been spened (from statement 1).\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude whether the dreb was vroombed or not. The possibility remains that the dreb was vroombed and subsequently spened, or it was not vroombed at all.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The dreb was not vroombed\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
