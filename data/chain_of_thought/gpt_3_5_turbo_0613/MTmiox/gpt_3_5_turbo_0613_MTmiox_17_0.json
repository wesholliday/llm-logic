It does not provide a definitive answer about whether the flob movated or not.\n\n2. \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated\" - This statement establishes a conditional relationship. It states that if the flob was skizzled, then it must have movated. However, it does not provide any information about whether the flob was actually skizzled or not.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot directly infer whether \"The flob was not skizzled\" or not. The information provided does not give us enough evidence to make a conclusive determination about the skizzling of the flob.\n\nAnswer: No",
