It states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. This does not provide any information about what happens if Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nThe second statement, \"Bob chose pasta,\" tells us that Bob indeed chose pasta. However, it does not provide any direct information about Sue's choice.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot conclude whether Sue chose pizza or not. The first statement only establishes a relationship between Sue's choice and Bob's choice, but it does not provide any information about Sue's choice independently. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive conclusion about Sue's choice based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
