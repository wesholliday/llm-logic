However, the given statements do not provide any direct information about Ben's actions or food choices. The only information we have is the conditional statement linking Ben's pasta consumption to Kate's salad consumption.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that Ben ate pasta.\n\nAnswer: No",
