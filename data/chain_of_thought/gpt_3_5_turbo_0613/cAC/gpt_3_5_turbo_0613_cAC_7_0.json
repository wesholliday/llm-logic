It states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This means that if the condition of Alex finishing the race is true, then the conclusion of Chris finishing the race must also be true.\n\nThe second statement, \"Chris finished the race,\" is a separate piece of information. It tells us that Chris indeed finished the race.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. However, we cannot definitively conclude that Alex finished the race because there is no information given about whether Alex actually finished the race or not.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
