It establishes a relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana. It states that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the apple is not red.\n\nThe second statement, \"The banana was yellow,\" tells us the color of the banana. It does not provide any information about the color of the apple.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot definitively conclude that the apple was red. The first statement only establishes a relationship between the colors of the apple and the banana, but it does not provide any information about the actual color of the apple. The second statement only tells us the color of the banana, but it does not provide any information about the color of the apple.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
