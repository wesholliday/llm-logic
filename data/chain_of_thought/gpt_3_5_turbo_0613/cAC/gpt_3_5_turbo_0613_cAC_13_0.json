It establishes a relationship between the color of the car and the color of the truck. It states that if the car is red, then the truck is blue. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the car is not red.\n\nThe second statement, \"The truck was blue,\" tells us the color of the truck. It does not provide any information about the color of the car.\n\nBased on these statements alone, we cannot definitively conclude that the car was red. The first statement only establishes a relationship between the car being red and the truck being blue, but it does not provide any information about the truck being blue and the car being red.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
