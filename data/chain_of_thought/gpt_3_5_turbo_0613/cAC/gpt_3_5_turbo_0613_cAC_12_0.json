It establishes a relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo. It does not provide any information about whether Joe actually went to the park or not.\n\nThe second statement, \"Lucy went to the zoo,\" tells us that Lucy did go to the zoo. However, it does not provide any direct information about Joe's whereabouts.\n\nBased on the given statements alone, we cannot conclude whether Joe went to the park or not. The first statement only establishes a relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo, but it does not tell us anything about Joe's actual actions. The second statement only provides information about Lucy's actions, not Joe's.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
