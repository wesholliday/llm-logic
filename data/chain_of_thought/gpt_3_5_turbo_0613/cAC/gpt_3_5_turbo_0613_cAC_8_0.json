It states that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake. \n\nThe second statement, \"The mummy was awake,\" provides information about the mummy's state of being. \n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that if the mummy is awake, it implies that the vampire must also be awake. This is because the first statement establishes a direct relationship between the two, stating that if one is awake, the other must be awake as well. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: yes.",
