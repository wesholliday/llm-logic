This statement establishes a conditional relationship between the alien visiting Mars and the robot visiting Jupiter.\n\nFrom statement 2, we are given the information that the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly conclude that the alien visited Mars based on these two statements alone. The first statement only establishes a conditional relationship, and the second statement only provides information about the robot's visit to Jupiter. We do not have any direct information about the alien's visit to Mars.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
