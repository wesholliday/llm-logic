In this case, we cannot directly infer the reverse statement because the original statement does not provide information about the relationship between the mummy and the vampire when the mummy is awake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake\" from \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
