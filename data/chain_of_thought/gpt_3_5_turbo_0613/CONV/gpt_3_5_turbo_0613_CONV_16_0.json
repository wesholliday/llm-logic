            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton\" from \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim,\" we need to analyze the logical structure of the statement.\n\nThe original statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\" In this case, A represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and B represents \"the pants were denim.\"\n\nIn a conditional statement, the inverse of the statement is formed by negating both the antecedent (A) and the consequent (B). The inverse of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\nSo, the inverse of the original statement would be \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\"\n\nNow, let's compare the original statement with its inverse:\n\nOriginal statement: If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\nInverse statement: If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\n\nFrom this comparison, we can see that the inverse statement is not the same as the original statement. In other words, the inverse statement does not have the same logical structure as the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton\" from \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
