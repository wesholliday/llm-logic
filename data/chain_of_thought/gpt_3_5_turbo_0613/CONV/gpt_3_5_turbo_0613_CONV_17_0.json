However, simply reversing the order of the original statement does not necessarily guarantee that the new statement is true.\n\nIn this case, reversing the original statement would result in \"If Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta.\" This new statement is not necessarily true because the original statement does not provide any information about what happens if Kate eats salad. It only establishes a relationship between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating salad.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta\" from \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
