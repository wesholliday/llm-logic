In this form, we have a hypothesis (Sam took a plane) and a conclusion (Erin took a train). The implication states that if the hypothesis is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo infer the statement \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane,\" we need to reverse the implication. This is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In a contrapositive, we negate both the hypothesis and the conclusion and reverse their order.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" would be \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
