The original statement tells us that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the unicorn is in the forest. It is possible that the griffin could be in the forest or somewhere else entirely.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was in the forest\" from \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
