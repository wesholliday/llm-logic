This can be done by applying the contrapositive rule, which states that if a conditional statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement is: \nNot Bob chose pasta -> Not Sue chose pizza\n\nBy reversing the direction and negating both the antecedent and the consequent, we obtain the contrapositive statement.\n\nTherefore, the statement 'If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza' can be inferred from the original statement 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
