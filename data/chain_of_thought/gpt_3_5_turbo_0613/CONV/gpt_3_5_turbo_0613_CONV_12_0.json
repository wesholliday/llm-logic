This means that if Joe went to the park, it guarantees that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nTo infer the reverse statement \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park,\" we need to determine if the logical relationship is bidirectional or if there are any additional conditions.\n\nIf the relationship is bidirectional, it means that the original statement implies the reverse statement, and vice versa. However, if there are additional conditions or constraints, we cannot make the inference.\n\nIn this case, since there are no additional conditions or constraints mentioned, and the original statement does not explicitly state a bidirectional relationship, we cannot infer \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park\" from \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
