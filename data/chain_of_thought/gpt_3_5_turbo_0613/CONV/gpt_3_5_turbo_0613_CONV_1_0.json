            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding' from 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe original statement, 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', is a conditional statement in the form of \"If A, then B\". This statement implies that the presence of Mary at the wedding guarantees the presence of Sue at the wedding.\n\nTo infer the statement 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding', we need to reverse the conditional relationship. This is known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating and reversing both the antecedent and the consequent.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' would be 'If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding'.\n\nNow, let's evaluate if the contrapositive statement is true based on the original statement. If Sue was not at the wedding, it does not necessarily mean that Mary was not at the wedding. It is possible that Mary attended the wedding even if Sue did not. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
