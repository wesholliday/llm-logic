It tells us that if the antecedent (A) is true, then the consequent (B) must also be true. However, it does not tell us anything about what happens if the consequent (B) is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot directly infer \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race\" from the original statement. The original statement does not provide any information about what happens if Chris finishes the race.\n\nAnswer: No",
