            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red\" from \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow,\" we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe original statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement in the form of \"If A, then B.\" This statement implies that the color of the banana depends on the color of the apple. If the apple is red, then the banana is yellow.\n\nTo infer the statement \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red,\" we need to reverse the original conditional statement. The reverse of a conditional statement is not always true. In this case, reversing the original statement would result in \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\"\n\nHowever, we cannot infer the reverse statement from the original statement alone. The original statement only tells us that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow. It does not provide any information about what happens if the banana is yellow.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red\" from \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
