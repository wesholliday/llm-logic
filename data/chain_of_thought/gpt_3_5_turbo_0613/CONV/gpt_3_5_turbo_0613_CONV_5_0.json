This is known as the converse of the original statement.\n\nThe converse of \"Jeff played basketball \u2192 Amy played tennis\" would be: Amy played tennis \u2192 Jeff played basketball.\n\nTo determine if the converse is true, we need to evaluate if the original statement guarantees the truth of the converse. In this case, the original statement does not guarantee that if Amy played tennis, Jeff played basketball. It only establishes a relationship between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis, not the other way around.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball\" from \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
