            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football\" from \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball,\" we need to analyze the logical structure of the statement.\n\nThe original statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\" In this case, A represents \"Tom watched football\" and B represents \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nTo infer the statement \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football,\" we need to reverse the order of the conditional statement. This is known as the contrapositive.\n\nThe contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, \"not B\" represents \"Jen did not watch basketball\" and \"not A\" represents \"Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nSo, to determine if we can infer the contrapositive statement, we need to evaluate if the original statement is true and if the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
