This is known as the converse of a conditional statement.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the converse of a conditional statement is not always true. In other words, just because \"If A, then B\" is true does not necessarily mean that \"If B, then A\" is also true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate\" from \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
