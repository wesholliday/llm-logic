However, there is a special type of conditional statement called a \"biconditional\" that allows us to infer the converse.\n\nA biconditional statement is of the form \"A if and only if B.\" In this case, if we have a biconditional statement that says \"The book was written by James if and only if the book is a mystery novel,\" then we can infer the converse.\n\nHowever, the original statement does not explicitly state \"if and only if,\" so we cannot infer the converse from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
