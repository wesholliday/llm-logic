            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt\" from \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt,\" we need to analyze the logical structure of the statement.\n\nThe original statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\" In this case, A is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and B is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nIn a conditional statement, the inverse of the statement is formed by negating both the antecedent (A) and the consequent (B). The inverse of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\nSo, the inverse of the original statement would be \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\n\nNow, let's compare the original statement with its inverse:\n\nOriginal statement: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\nInverse statement: If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nThe inverse statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Just because Lisa did not buy the red shirt does not necessarily mean that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. It is possible for Mark to buy the blue shirt even if Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
