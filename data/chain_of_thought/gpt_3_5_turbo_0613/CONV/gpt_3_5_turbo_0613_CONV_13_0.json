In this case, A represents the car being red, and B represents the truck being blue.\n\nTo infer the statement \"If the truck was blue, then the car was red\", we need to reverse the logical structure of the original statement. This is known as the contrapositive.\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\". In this case, \"not B\" represents the truck not being blue, and \"not A\" represents the car not being red.\n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive statement \"If not B, then not A\" with the statement \"If the truck was blue, then the car was red\". If these two statements have the same meaning, then we can infer the latter from the former.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
