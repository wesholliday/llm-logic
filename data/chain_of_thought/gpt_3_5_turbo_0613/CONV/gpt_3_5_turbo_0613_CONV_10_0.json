This is known as the contrapositive.\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, \"not B\" represents the cat not being outside, and \"not A\" represents the dog not being inside.\n\nTo determine if the contrapositive is true, we need to consider the logical relationship between the original statement and its contrapositive. In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are always equivalent. If the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nTherefore, if the original statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" is true, we can infer that the contrapositive \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
