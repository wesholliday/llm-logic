The inverse of \"If A, then B\" would be \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\nTherefore, the inverse of the original statement would be \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\"\n\nNow, let's compare the inverse statement with the statement \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic.\" The inverse statement is not the same as the statement we are trying to infer.\n\nHence, we cannot infer \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic\" from \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
