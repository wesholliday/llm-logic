This means that if Joe went to the park, it guarantees that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nTo infer the second statement \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park,\" we need to negate both sides of the original statement. Negating \"Joe -> Lucy\" gives us \"\u00ac(Joe -> Lucy)\" which can be rewritten as \"Joe and \u00acLucy\" (Joe and not Lucy).\n\nTherefore, the inferred statement would be \"Joe and not Lucy.\" This means that if Lucy did not go to the zoo, it implies that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
