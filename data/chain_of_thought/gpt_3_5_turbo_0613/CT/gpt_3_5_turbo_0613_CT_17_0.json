Negating A would be \"Ben did not eat pasta,\" and negating B would be \"Kate did not eat the salad.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if the negated statement \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta\" is logically equivalent to the original statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\"\n\nTo do this, we can consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the contrapositive of \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\" would be \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n\nSince the contrapositive of the original statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta\" from \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
