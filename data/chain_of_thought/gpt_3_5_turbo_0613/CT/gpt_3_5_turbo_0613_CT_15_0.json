The negation of P is \"Sam did not take a plane,\" and the negation of Q is \"Erin did not take a train.\" The reversed statement would be:\n\nQ' \u2192 P'\n\nSo, the statement \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane\" can be represented as Q' \u2192 P'.\n\nNow, let's analyze if Q' \u2192 P' is logically equivalent to P \u2192 Q.\n\nIf we negate both sides of P \u2192 Q, we get \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ, which means \"If not P, then not Q.\"\n\nComparing \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ with Q' \u2192 P', we can see that they have the same logical structure. Therefore, we can infer \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane\" from \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
