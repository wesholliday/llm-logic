Negating the original statement gives us:\n\nNot (Alien visited Mars) -> Not (Robot visited Jupiter)\n\nNow, let's compare the negated statement with the statement we want to infer:\n\nNot (Alien visited Mars) -> Not (Robot visited Jupiter) vs. If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars\n\nBy comparing the two statements, we can see that they have the same logical structure. The negated statement matches the structure of the statement we want to infer. Therefore, we can infer \"If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars\" from \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
