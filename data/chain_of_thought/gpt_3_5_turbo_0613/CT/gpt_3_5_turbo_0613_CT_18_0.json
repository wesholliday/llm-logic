Negating the original statement gives us:\n\n\u00ac(Doll (plastic)) \u2192 \u00ac(Truck (metal))\n\nThis can be translated as \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\"\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\" from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: No",
