The negation of the original statement is about Jeff not playing basketball, while the statement we want to infer is about Amy not playing tennis.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\" from the given statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
