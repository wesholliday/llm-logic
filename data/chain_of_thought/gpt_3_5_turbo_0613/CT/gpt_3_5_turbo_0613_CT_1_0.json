            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\" from \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe original statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement in the form of \"If A, then B.\" In this case, A represents Mary being at the wedding, and B represents Sue being at the wedding.\n\nWhen we negate a conditional statement, we switch the truth value of the hypothesis (A) and the conclusion (B). So, the negation of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nIn this case, the negation of \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" would be \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\" from \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
