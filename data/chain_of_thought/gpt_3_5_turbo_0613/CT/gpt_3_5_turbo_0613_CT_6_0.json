The contrapositive of a conditional statement switches the hypothesis and conclusion and negates both.\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement is: Not Bob chose pasta \u2192 Not Sue chose pizza.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\" can be inferred from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
