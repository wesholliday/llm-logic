            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton\" from \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim,\" we need to analyze the logical structure of the statement.\n\nThe original statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\" In this case, A represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and B represents \"the pants were denim.\"\n\nTo infer the statement \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton,\" we need to negate both A and B in the original statement. Negating A would be \"the shirt was not cotton,\" and negating B would be \"the pants were not denim.\"\n\nNow, we can rephrase the original statement with the negations: \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\"\n\nBy comparing the original statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" with the negated statement \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim,\" we can see that they are not equivalent. The negated statement is the contrapositive of the original statement, which is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton\" from \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
