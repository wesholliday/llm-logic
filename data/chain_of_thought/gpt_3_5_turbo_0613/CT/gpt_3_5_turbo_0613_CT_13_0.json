            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\" from \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\", we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe original statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P represents \"the car was red\" and Q represents \"the truck was blue\". This is an example of a conditional statement.\n\nTo infer the statement \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\", we need to negate both the antecedent and the consequent of the original statement. Negating \"the truck was blue\" gives us \"the truck was not blue\", and negating \"the car was red\" gives us \"the car was not red\". So, the inferred statement can be represented as \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\".\n\nTo determine if the inferred statement is valid, we can compare it to the original statement. If the inferred statement is the contrapositive of the original statement, then it is valid.\n\nThe contrapositive of \"P \u2192 Q\" is \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\". Therefore, if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
