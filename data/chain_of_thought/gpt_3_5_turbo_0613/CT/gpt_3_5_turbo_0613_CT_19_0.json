This means that if A is true, B must also be true. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if A is false.\n\nIn the second statement, if Jen did not watch basketball (C), then Tom did not watch football (D). This means that if C is true, D must also be true.\n\nSince the given statement does not provide any information about what happens if A is false, we cannot infer the statement \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
