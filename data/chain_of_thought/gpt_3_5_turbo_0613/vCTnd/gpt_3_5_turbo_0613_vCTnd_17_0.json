The argument can be represented symbolically as follows:\n\nPremise: If A, then B\nConclusion: If B, then not A\n\nTo evaluate the validity, we can use a technique called the Law of Contrapositive. According to the Law of Contrapositive, if a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is true, then its contrapositive \"If not B, then not A\" is also true.\n\nIn this case, the premise \"If the customer was greeted, then they were not greeted warmly\" can be rewritten as \"If A, then B\" (where A represents the customer being greeted and B represents the customer not being greeted warmly). \n\nThe conclusion \"If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted\" can be rewritten as \"If B, then not A\" (where B represents the customer being greeted warmly and A represents the customer being greeted).\n\nBy applying the Law of Contrapositive, we can see that the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. Therefore, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
