In other words, we need to check if the conclusion can be derived from the premise using valid logical reasoning.\n\nBy examining the premise and the conclusion, we can see that they have the same logical form: If P, then \u00acQ. This is known as a contrapositive statement. In a contrapositive statement, the conclusion is logically equivalent to the premise.\n\nIn this case, the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
