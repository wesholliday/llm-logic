In other words, we need to check if the conclusion can be derived from the premise using valid logical reasoning.\n\nBy examining the premise and conclusion, we can see that the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
