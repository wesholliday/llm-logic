The argument can be represented symbolically as follows:\n\nPremise: If P, then not Q\nConclusion: If Q, then not P\n\nTo evaluate the validity of this argument, we can use a truth table. Let's assign P as \"the job was completed\" and Q as \"the job was completed well.\"\n\n| P | Q | If P, then not Q | If Q, then not P |\n|---|---|-----------------|-----------------|\n| T | T |       F         |       F         |\n| T | F |       T         |       F         |\n| F | T |       T         |       T         |\n| F | F |       T         |       T         |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that there are cases where the premise is true (T) and the conclusion is false (F). Specifically, when P is false (the job was not completed), the premise is true, but the conclusion is false. This means that the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
