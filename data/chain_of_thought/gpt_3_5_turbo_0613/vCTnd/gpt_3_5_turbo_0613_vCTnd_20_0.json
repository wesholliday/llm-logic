The argument can be represented symbolically as follows:\n\nPremise: If A, then not B\nConclusion: If B, then not A\n\nTo evaluate the validity of this argument, we can use a technique called the method of logical inference. We will assume the premise is true and see if the conclusion must also be true based on that assumption.\n\nAssume the premise is true: If A, then not B\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion: If B, then not A\n\nIf we assume B is true, then according to the premise, A must be false. So, the conclusion holds true based on the assumption.\n\nSince the conclusion follows logically from the premise, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
