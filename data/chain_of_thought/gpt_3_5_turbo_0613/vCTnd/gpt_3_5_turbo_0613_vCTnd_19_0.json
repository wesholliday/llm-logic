The argument can be represented symbolically as follows:\n\nPremise: If A, then B\nConclusion: If B, then not A\n\nTo evaluate the validity of this argument, we can use a technique called the Law of Contrapositive. According to the Law of Contrapositive, if a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is true, then its contrapositive \"If not B, then not A\" is also true.\n\nIn this case, the argument's conclusion is the contrapositive of its premise. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
