The argument can be represented symbolically as follows:\n\nPremise: If A, then not B\nConclusion: If B, then not A\n\nTo evaluate the validity of this argument, we can use a technique called the method of counterexample. We need to find a scenario where the premise is true (A is true and B is false) but the conclusion is false (B is true and A is false).\n\nLet's consider a counterexample:\nA: Advice was offered\nB: Advice was not helpful\n\nCounterexample:\nPremise: If advice was offered (A), then it was not helpful advice (not B) - True\nConclusion: If helpful advice (B) was offered, then advice (A) was not offered - False\n\nIn this counterexample, the premise is true (advice was offered, but it was not helpful), but the conclusion is false (helpful advice was offered, but advice was also offered).\n\nSince we have found a counterexample where the premise is true but the conclusion is false, we can conclude that the argument is logically invalid.\n\nAnswer: No",
