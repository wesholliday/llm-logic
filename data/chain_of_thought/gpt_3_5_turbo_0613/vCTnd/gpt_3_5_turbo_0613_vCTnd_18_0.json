The argument can be represented symbolically as follows:\n\nPremise: If A, then B\nConclusion: If B, then not A\n\nTo evaluate the validity of this argument, we can use a technique called the method of inference called modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, then we can conclude that A must also be false.\n\nIn this case, the argument follows the form of modus tollens. The premise states \"If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth.\" The conclusion states \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed.\" By applying modus tollens, we can see that if the conclusion is false (i.e., the issue was discussed in depth), then the premise must also be false (i.e., the issue was not discussed).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
