The argument can be represented symbolically as follows:\n\nPremise: If A, then B\nConclusion: If B, then not A\n\nTo evaluate the validity of this argument, we can use a truth table. Let's assign 'A' to represent \"the room was tidied\" and 'B' to represent \"the room was tidied thoroughly.\"\n\n| A | B | If A, then B | If B, then not A |\n|---|---|--------------|-----------------|\n| T | T | T            | F               |\n| T | F | F            | T               |\n| F | T | T            | F               |\n| F | F | T            | T               |\n\nLooking at the truth table, we can see that there are cases where the premise is true (A is true and B is false), but the conclusion is false (If B, then not A is false). Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
