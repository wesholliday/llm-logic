According to this law, if a conditional statement (P1) is true, then its contrapositive (C) is also true.\n\nThe contrapositive of P1 is: \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise.\" This is exactly the same as the conclusion (C).\n\nSince the contrapositive of the premise is the same as the conclusion, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
