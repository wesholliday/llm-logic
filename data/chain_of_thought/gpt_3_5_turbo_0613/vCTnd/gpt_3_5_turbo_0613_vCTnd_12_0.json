In other words, we need to check if the conclusion is a valid logical consequence of the premise.\n\nBy examining the logical structure of the argument, we can see that the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
