            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the form of the argument. The argument can be represented symbolically as follows:\n\nPremise: If A, then B\nConclusion: If B, then not A\n\nTo evaluate the validity of this argument, we can use a technique called the Law of Contrapositive. According to the Law of Contrapositive, if a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is true, then its contrapositive \"If not B, then not A\" is also true.\n\nIn this case, the premise \"If the clothes were washed, then they were not washed properly\" can be rewritten as \"If A, then B\" (where A represents \"the clothes were washed\" and B represents \"the clothes were not washed properly\"). \n\nThe conclusion \"If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed\" can be rewritten as \"If B, then not A\" (where B represents \"the clothes were not washed properly\" and A represents \"the clothes were washed\").\n\nNow, if we apply the Law of Contrapositive, we can see that the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
