According to this rule, if a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) is true, then its contrapositive (~Q \u2192 ~P) is also true.\n\nIn this case, the premise \"If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables\" can be rewritten as \"If ~Q, then ~P\" (contrapositive form).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
