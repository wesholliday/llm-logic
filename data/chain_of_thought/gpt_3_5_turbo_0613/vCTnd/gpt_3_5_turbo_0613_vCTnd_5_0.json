            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the form of the argument. The argument can be represented symbolically as follows:\n\nPremise: If A, then B\nConclusion: If B, then not A\n\nTo evaluate the validity of this argument, we can use a technique called the Law of Contrapositive. According to the Law of Contrapositive, if a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is true, then its contrapositive \"If not B, then not A\" is also true.\n\nIn this case, the premise \"If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly\" can be rewritten as \"If A, then B\" (where A represents \"the room was cleaned\" and B represents \"the room was not cleaned thoroughly\"). \n\nThe conclusion \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned\" can be rewritten as \"If B, then not A\" (where B represents \"the room was not cleaned thoroughly\" and A represents \"the room was cleaned\").\n\nNow, if we apply the Law of Contrapositive, we can see that the contrapositive of the premise \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\". Therefore, the contrapositive of the premise is equivalent to the conclusion.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
