The argument can be represented symbolically as follows:\n\nPremise: If A, then B\nConclusion: If B, then not A\n\nThis argument follows the form of a valid logical inference known as contraposition. In contraposition, if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B,\" we can infer the logically equivalent statement \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nIn this case, the argument follows the form of contraposition, where A represents \"the customer was served\" and B represents \"the customer was served promptly.\" The premise states \"If A, then B,\" and the conclusion states \"If B, then not A.\"\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
