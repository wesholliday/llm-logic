            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the form of the argument. The argument can be represented symbolically as follows:\n\nPremise: If P, then not Q\nConclusion: If Q, then not P\n\nThis argument follows the form of a valid logical inference known as contraposition. The contraposition of a conditional statement states that if the consequent is true, then the antecedent must also be true. In other words, if we negate both the antecedent and the consequent of a conditional statement and switch their positions, the resulting statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nIn this case, the argument follows the contraposition form, where the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
