The argument can be represented symbolically as follows:\n\nPremise: If P, then not Q\nConclusion: If Q, then not P\n\nTo evaluate the validity of this argument, we can use a technique called the method of contraposition. According to this method, if a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is true, then its contrapositive \"If not Q, then not P\" is also true.\n\nIn this case, the premise \"If I ate a meal, then I did not eat a large meal\" can be rewritten as \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal\" by applying the contrapositive. \n\nNow, let's compare the conclusion \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal\" with the rewritten premise \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal.\" We can see that they are identical.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
