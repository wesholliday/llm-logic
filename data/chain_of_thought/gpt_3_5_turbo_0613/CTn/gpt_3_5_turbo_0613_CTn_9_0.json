So, the second statement would be: If Q, then not P.\n\nNow, let's analyze if the second statement is true based on the original statement. If Mark bought the blue shirt (Q), can we conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt (not P)?\n\nFrom the original statement, we know that if Lisa bought the red shirt (P), then Mark did not buy the blue shirt (Q). However, this does not necessarily mean that if Mark bought the blue shirt (Q), then Lisa did not buy the red shirt (not P).\n\nThe original statement only provides information about the relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark not buying the blue shirt. It does not provide any information about the relationship between Mark buying the blue shirt and Lisa not buying the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt' from 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt'.\n\nAnswer: No",
