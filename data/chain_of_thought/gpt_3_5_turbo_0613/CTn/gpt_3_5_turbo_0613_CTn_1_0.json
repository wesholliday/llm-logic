            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding' from 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statement.\n\nThe original statement, 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding', can be represented as:\n\nP: Mary was at the wedding\nQ: Sue was not at the wedding\n\nThe statement can be written as: If P, then Q.\n\nTo infer the statement 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding', we need to reverse the order of the variables. So, it becomes:\n\nIf Q, then P.\n\nNow, let's analyze if this inference is valid. The original statement states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if Sue was at the wedding. It is possible that both Mary and Sue were not at the wedding, or that only Sue was at the wedding while Mary was not. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
