We can do this by taking the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of \"DogInside -> CatNotOutside\" is:\n\nNotCatNotOutside -> NotDogInside\n\nThis can be simplified to:\n\nCatOutside -> DogNotInside\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
