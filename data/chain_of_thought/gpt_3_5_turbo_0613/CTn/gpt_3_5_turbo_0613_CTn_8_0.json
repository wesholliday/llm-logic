            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake\" from \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was not awake\", we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe original statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was not awake\" can be represented as:\n\nVampire awake \u2192 Mummy not awake\n\nTo infer the statement \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake\", we need to reverse the logical relationship. In other words, we need to determine if the following statement is true:\n\nMummy awake \u2192 Vampire not awake\n\nTo do this, we can use the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\". Applying this to the original statement, we get:\n\nNot (Mummy not awake) \u2192 Not (Vampire awake)\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\nMummy awake \u2192 Vampire not awake\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
