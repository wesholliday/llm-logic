The inverse of P -> Q is ~P -> ~Q, which means \"If not P, then not Q\".\n\nIn this case, the inverse statement would be \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis\".\n\nTo determine if the inverse statement is true, we need to consider if the original statement guarantees that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis. However, the original statement does not provide any information about what happens if Jeff did not play basketball. It only tells us what happens if Jeff did play basketball.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball' from 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy did not play tennis'.\n\nAnswer: No",
