            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"If the truck was blue, then the car was not red\" from \"If the car was red, then the truck was not blue\", we need to analyze the logical structure of the statement.\n\nThe original statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was not blue\" is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\". In this case, A represents the car being red, and B represents the truck not being blue.\n\nTo infer the statement \"If the truck was blue, then the car was not red\", we need to reverse the conditional statement. This is done by swapping the antecedent (A) and the consequent (B) and negating both.\n\nSo, the reversed statement would be \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was red\". However, this is not the same as the statement we are trying to infer.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the truck was blue, then the car was not red\" from \"If the car was red, then the truck was not blue\".\n\nAnswer: No",
