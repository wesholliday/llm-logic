This can be done using the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of \"Bear in cave \u2192 Wolf not in den\" is:\n\nWolf in den \u2192 Bear not in cave\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
