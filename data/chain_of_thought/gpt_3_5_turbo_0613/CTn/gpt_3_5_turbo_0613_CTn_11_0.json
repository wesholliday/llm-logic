In this case, P represents \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q represents \"the muffins were not blueberry\".\n\nTo infer the statement \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\", we need to reverse the conditional statement. This is known as the contrapositive.\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry\" would be \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
