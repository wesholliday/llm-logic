This can be done using the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of \"Shirt (cotton) \u2192 Pants (not denim)\" is:\n\nPants (denim) \u2192 Shirt (not cotton)\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
