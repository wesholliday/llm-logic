            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza' from 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statement.\n\nThe original statement, 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta', can be represented as:\n\nSue chose pizza \u2192 Bob did not choose pasta\n\nTo infer the statement 'If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza', we need to reverse the direction of the implication. This can be done by applying the contrapositive rule, which states that if we negate both the antecedent and the consequent of an implication and reverse their order, the resulting statement is logically equivalent.\n\nNegating the antecedent (Sue chose pizza) and the consequent (Bob did not choose pasta) of the original statement, we get:\n\n\u00ac(Sue chose pizza) \u2192 \u00ac(Bob did not choose pasta)\n\nReversing the order, we obtain:\n\n\u00ac(Bob did not choose pasta) \u2192 \u00ac(Sue chose pizza)\n\nSimplifying the double negations, we have:\n\nBob chose pasta \u2192 Sue did not choose pizza\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
