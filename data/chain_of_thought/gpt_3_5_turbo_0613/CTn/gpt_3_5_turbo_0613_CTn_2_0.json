The negation of the original statement is:\nGriffin in forest \u2192 Unicorn in forest\n\nHowever, this negated statement does not match the new statement we are trying to infer. The new statement is:\nUnicorn in forest \u2192 Griffin not in forest\n\nSince the negated statement does not match the new statement, we cannot infer the statement \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\" from the given statement. \n\nAnswer: No",
