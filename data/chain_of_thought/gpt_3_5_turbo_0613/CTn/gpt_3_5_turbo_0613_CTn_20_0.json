In this case, A represents the apple being red, and B represents the banana not being yellow.\n\nTo infer the statement \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red\", we need to reverse the conditional statement. This is known as the contrapositive.\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\". In this case, not B represents the banana being yellow, and not A represents the apple not being red.\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of \"If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow\" is \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
