Bob might not have chosen pasta.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. This means that if Sue did not choose pizza, we cannot determine what Bob chose.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that Bob might not have chosen pasta. This means that there is a possibility that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza. However, we cannot definitively infer that Sue did not choose pizza because there is still a chance that Bob did choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: No",
