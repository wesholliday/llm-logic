Sue might not have been at the wedding.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Mary was present at the wedding, then Sue must have also been present. This means that if Mary was not at the wedding, we cannot conclude anything about Sue's presence.\n\nStatement 2 introduces the possibility that Sue might not have been at the wedding. This means that Sue's presence at the wedding is uncertain.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot infer whether Mary was at the wedding or not. The information provided does not provide any direct or indirect evidence about Mary's presence at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No",
