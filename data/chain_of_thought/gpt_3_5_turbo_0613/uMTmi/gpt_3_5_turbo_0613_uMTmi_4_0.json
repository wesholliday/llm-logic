The robot might not have visited Jupiter.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. However, statement 2 introduces uncertainty by saying that the robot might not have visited Jupiter. This means that there is a possibility that the robot did not visit Jupiter, even though it is a requirement for the alien to have visited Mars.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively infer that the alien did not visit Mars. The possibility remains that the robot did not visit Jupiter, which would mean that the condition for the alien visiting Mars was not met. Therefore, we cannot make a conclusive inference about the alien's visit to Mars.\n\nAnswer: No",
