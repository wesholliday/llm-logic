The truck might not have been metal.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was definitely metal. This is a conditional statement.\n\nFrom statement 2, we are told that the truck might not have been metal. This means there is a possibility that the truck was not metal.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer that the doll was not plastic?\n\nBased on the information given, we cannot definitively infer that the doll was not plastic. While it is true that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal, the possibility that the truck was not metal leaves room for uncertainty. Therefore, we cannot make a conclusive inference about the doll's material.\n\nAnswer: No",
