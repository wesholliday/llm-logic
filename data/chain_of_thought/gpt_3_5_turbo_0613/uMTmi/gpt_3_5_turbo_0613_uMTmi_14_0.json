The wolf might not have been in the den.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was definitely in the den. This is a conditional statement.\n\nHowever, statement 2 introduces uncertainty by saying that the wolf might not have been in the den. This means that there is a possibility that the wolf was not in the den.\n\nGiven this information, we cannot definitively infer whether the bear was or was not in the cave. The possibility remains open.\n\nAnswer: No",
