The mummy might not have been awake.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake as well. This means that if the vampire was not awake, we cannot conclude anything about the state of the mummy.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the mummy might not have been awake. This means that there is a possibility that the mummy was not awake, but it does not provide any information about the state of the vampire.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot infer whether the vampire was awake or not. The possibility of the mummy not being awake does not provide enough information to determine the state of the vampire.\n\nAnswer: No",
