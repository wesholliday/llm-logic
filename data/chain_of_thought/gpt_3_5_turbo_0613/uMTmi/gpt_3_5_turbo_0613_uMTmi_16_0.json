The pants might not have been denim.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were definitely denim. This means that if the pants were not denim, then the shirt could not have been cotton.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the pants might not have been denim. This means that there is a possibility that the pants were not denim.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that there is a possibility that the shirt was not cotton. However, we cannot definitively infer that the shirt was not cotton because there is still a chance that the pants were denim.\n\nAnswer: No",
