Jen might not have watched basketball.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Tom watched football, then Jen definitely watched basketball. This means that if Tom did not watch football, it is not possible for Jen to have watched basketball.\n\nHowever, statement 2 introduces the possibility that Jen might not have watched basketball. This means that there is a chance that Jen did not watch basketball, regardless of whether Tom watched football or not.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively infer whether Tom watched football or not.",
