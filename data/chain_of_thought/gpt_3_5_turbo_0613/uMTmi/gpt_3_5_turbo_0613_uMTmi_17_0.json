If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\n   This statement establishes a conditional relationship between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating salad. If Ben ate pasta, it guarantees that Kate ate salad.\n\n2. Kate might not have eaten salad.\n   This statement introduces a possibility that Kate did not eat salad. It suggests that there is a chance that Kate did not follow the condition mentioned in the first statement.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot definitively infer whether Ben ate pasta or not. The possibility that Kate might not have eaten salad means that the condition in the first statement could be false, and therefore, it does not provide conclusive evidence about Ben's pasta consumption.\n\nAnswer: No",
