Chris might not have finished the race.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Alex finished the race, then Chris definitely finished the race. This means that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris also did not finish the race.\n\nHowever, statement 2 introduces the possibility that Chris might not have finished the race. This means that there is uncertainty about whether Chris finished the race or not.\n\nGiven this information, we cannot definitively infer whether Alex finished the race or not. It is possible that Alex finished the race, and Chris also finished the race. It is also possible that Alex did not finish the race, and Chris may or may not have finished the race.\n\nAnswer: No",
