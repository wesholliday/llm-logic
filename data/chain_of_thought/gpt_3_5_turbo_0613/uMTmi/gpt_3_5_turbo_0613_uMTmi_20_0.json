The banana might not have been yellow.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. This means that if the banana was not yellow, then the apple could not have been red.\n\nStatement 2 introduces the possibility that the banana might not have been yellow. This means that there is a chance that the apple was not red.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can infer that it is possible that the apple was not red. However, we cannot definitively conclude that the apple was not red because there is still a chance that the banana was yellow.\n\nAnswer: No",
