The unicorn might not have been in the forest.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was definitely in the forest. This is a conditional statement.\n\nHowever, statement 2 introduces uncertainty by saying that the unicorn might not have been in the forest. This means that there is a possibility that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nGiven this information, we cannot definitively infer whether the griffin was or was not in the forest. The possibility remains open.\n\nAnswer: No",
