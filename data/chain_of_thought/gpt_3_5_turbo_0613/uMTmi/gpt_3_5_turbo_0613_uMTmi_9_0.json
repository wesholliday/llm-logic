Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This means that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, we cannot conclude anything about what Mark bought.\n\nStatement 2 introduces the possibility that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. This means that even if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, Mark could have still bought the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
