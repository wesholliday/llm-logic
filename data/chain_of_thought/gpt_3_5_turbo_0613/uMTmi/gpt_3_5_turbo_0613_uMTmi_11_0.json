The muffins might not have been blueberry.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were definitely blueberry. This means that if the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake cannot be chocolate.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the muffins might not have been blueberry. This means there is a possibility that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that it is possible that the cake was not chocolate. However, we cannot definitively infer that the cake was not chocolate because there is still a possibility that the muffins were blueberry.\n\nAnswer: No",
