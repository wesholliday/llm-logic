The truck might not have been blue.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. This means that if the car was not red, we cannot make any conclusions about the color of the truck.\n\nStatement 2 introduces the possibility that the truck might not have been blue. This means that the truck could have been a different color, which contradicts the inference made in statement 1.\n\nBased on this analysis, we cannot infer that the car was not red.",
