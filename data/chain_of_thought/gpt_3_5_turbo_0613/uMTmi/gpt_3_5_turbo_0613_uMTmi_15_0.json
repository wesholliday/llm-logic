Erin might not have taken a train.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Sam took a plane, Erin must have taken a train. This means that if Sam did not take a plane, Erin did not take a train.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that Erin might not have taken a train. This means that there is a possibility that Erin did not take a train.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that there is a possibility that Sam did not take a plane. However, we cannot definitively infer that Sam did not take a plane because there could be other possibilities for Erin's mode of transportation.\n\nAnswer: No",
