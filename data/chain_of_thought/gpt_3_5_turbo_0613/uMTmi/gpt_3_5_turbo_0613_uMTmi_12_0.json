Lucy might not have gone to the zoo.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Joe went to the park, Lucy went to the zoo. However, statement 2 introduces the possibility that Lucy might not have gone to the zoo. This means that there is uncertainty about whether Lucy actually went to the zoo or not.\n\nGiven this information, we cannot definitively infer whether Joe went to the park or not. The possibility remains that Joe went to the park, and Lucy either went to the zoo or did not go at all. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: No",
