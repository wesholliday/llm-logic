Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet.\n2. It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the jacket is either draped over the chair or hanging in the closet. This means that one of these two options must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet. This means that the second option (the jacket hanging in the closet) is not necessarily true.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair because it is the only remaining option.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
