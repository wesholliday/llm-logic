Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n2. It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the toy is either in the toy box or on the bookshelf. However, statement 2 tells us that it is not necessary for the toy to be on the bookshelf. \n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively infer that the toy is in the toy box. It is possible that the toy is on the bookshelf, even though it is not required to be there. \n\nAnswer: No",
