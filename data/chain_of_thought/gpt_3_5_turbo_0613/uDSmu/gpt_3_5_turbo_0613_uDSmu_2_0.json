It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can conclude that if the book is not on the shelf, then it must be resting on the table. This is because the statement says that one of these two conditions must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not true that the book must be resting on the table. This means that the book cannot only be resting on the table, but it could also be on the shelf.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that the book could be either on the shelf or resting on the table, but we cannot definitively conclude that it is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: No",
