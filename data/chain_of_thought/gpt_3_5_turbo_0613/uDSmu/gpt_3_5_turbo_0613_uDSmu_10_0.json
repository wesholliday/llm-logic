Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed.\n2. It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the missing sock is either in the laundry basket or under the bed. However, we don't have any information to determine which of the two options is true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed. This means that the missing sock could be in the laundry basket.\n\nBased on the given information, we can infer that the missing sock could be in the laundry basket, but we cannot definitively conclude that it is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: No",
