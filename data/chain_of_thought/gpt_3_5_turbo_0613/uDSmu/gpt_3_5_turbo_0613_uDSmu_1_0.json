It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that Fido is either inside or in the garden. However, statement 2 tells us that Fido must not be in the garden. \n\nIf Fido cannot be in the garden, then the only possibility left is that Fido is inside. Therefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
