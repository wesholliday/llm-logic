It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the pen is either in the bag or on the desk. However, statement 2 tells us that it is not necessary for the pen to be on the desk. \n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively infer that the pen is in the bag. It is possible that the pen is on the desk, even though it is not required to be there. \n\nAnswer: No",
