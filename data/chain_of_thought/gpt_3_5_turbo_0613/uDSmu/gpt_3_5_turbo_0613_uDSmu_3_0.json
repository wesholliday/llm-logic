Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\n2. It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\n\nFrom statement 2, we can conclude that the keys are not necessarily dangling in the cabinet. This means that the first option in statement 1 (the keys are in the drawer) is still a possibility.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the keys could be in the drawer, but we cannot definitively conclude that they are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: No",
