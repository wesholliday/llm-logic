Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\n2. It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\n\nFrom statement 2, we can conclude that the milk is not chilling in the fridge. \n\nHowever, statement 1 tells us that the milk is either on the counter or chilling in the fridge. Since we know it's not chilling in the fridge, the only remaining possibility is that the milk is on the counter.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
