Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry.\n2. It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the cookies are either in the jar or hidden in the pantry. However, statement 2 tells us that it is not necessary for the cookies to be hidden in the pantry. \n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively infer that the cookies are in the jar. It is possible that they are in the jar, but it is also possible that they are hidden in the pantry. \n\nAnswer: No",
