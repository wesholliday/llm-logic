Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\n2. It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the watch is either charging on the dresser or on his wrist. \n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not necessary for the watch to be on his wrist. \n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the watch could be either charging on the dresser or not on his wrist, but we cannot definitively infer that it is charging on the dresser. \n\nAnswer: No",
