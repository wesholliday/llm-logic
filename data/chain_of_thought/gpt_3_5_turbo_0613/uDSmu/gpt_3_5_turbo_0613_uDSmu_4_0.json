This means that these are the only two possibilities for the cat's location.\n\nAdditionally, it states that it's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom. This implies that the cat is not necessarily playing in the bedroom.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the cat must be napping on the couch. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
