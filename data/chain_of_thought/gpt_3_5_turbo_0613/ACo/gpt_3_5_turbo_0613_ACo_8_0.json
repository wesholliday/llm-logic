This means that whenever the vampire is awake, the mummy must also be awake. However, it does not provide any information about the vampire's state of being awake or not.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot directly infer whether the vampire was awake or not. The statements only tell us that the mummy was awake, but they do not provide any information about the vampire's state. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the vampire was awake. \n\nAnswer: No",
