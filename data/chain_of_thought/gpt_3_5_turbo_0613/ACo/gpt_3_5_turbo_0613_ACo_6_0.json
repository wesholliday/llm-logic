This is a direct statement and we can assume it to be true.\n\nWe are also given the conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This statement implies that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob definitely chose pasta. However, it does not provide any information about whether Sue actually chose pizza or not.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot directly infer whether Sue chose pizza or not. The conditional statement only tells us what would happen if Sue chose pizza, but it does not tell us whether she actually did. Therefore, we cannot make a definite conclusion about Sue's choice based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
