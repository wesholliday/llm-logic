It states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that if the muffins were blueberry, then the cake could have been chocolate. However, we cannot definitively infer that the cake was chocolate because there could be other possibilities. The given information does not provide any direct evidence about the flavor of the cake.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
