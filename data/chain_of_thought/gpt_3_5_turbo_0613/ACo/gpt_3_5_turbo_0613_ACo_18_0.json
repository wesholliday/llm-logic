If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the truck was metal. \n\nStatement 2 introduces a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This means that if the doll was indeed plastic, then it implies that the truck was metal. However, it does not provide any information about the doll itself.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer whether 'The doll was plastic' or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
