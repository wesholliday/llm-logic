It states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris also finished the race.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that if Alex finishes the race, then Chris finishes the race. However, we cannot directly infer whether Alex finishes the race or not. The given information does not provide any direct information about Alex's completion of the race.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
