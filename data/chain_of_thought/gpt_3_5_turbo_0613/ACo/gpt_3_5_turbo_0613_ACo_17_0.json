However, it does not provide any information about whether Ben actually ate pasta or not.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot directly infer whether Ben ate pasta or not. The statements only tell us that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad, but they do not provide any information about Ben's actions.\n\nAnswer: No",
