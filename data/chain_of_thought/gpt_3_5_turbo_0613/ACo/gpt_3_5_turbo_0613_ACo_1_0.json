The statement \"Sue was at the wedding\" tells us that Sue attended the wedding.\n2. The conditional statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" suggests that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue also attended.\n\nBased on this information, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was definitely at the wedding.\n- However, we cannot conclude that Mary was at the wedding solely based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Mary was at the wedding.",
