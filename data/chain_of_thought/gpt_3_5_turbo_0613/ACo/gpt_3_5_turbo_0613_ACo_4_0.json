It states that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If the robot visited Jupiter, it means that the alien visited Mars. This is because the second statement establishes a conditional relationship between the alien visiting Mars and the robot visiting Jupiter.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
