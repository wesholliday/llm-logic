It states that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n- The banana was yellow.\n\nHowever, we do not have any direct information about the color of the apple. The conditional statement only tells us what would happen if the apple was red. It does not provide any information about the actual color of the apple.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The apple was red\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
