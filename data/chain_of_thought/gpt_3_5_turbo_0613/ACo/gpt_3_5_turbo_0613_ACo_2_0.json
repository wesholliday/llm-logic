This means that the presence of the griffin in the forest is a necessary condition for the unicorn to be in the forest.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer that the griffin was in the forest based on the given statements. The conditional statement only establishes a relationship between the griffin and the unicorn, but it does not provide any information about the griffin's actual location.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the griffin was in the forest based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
