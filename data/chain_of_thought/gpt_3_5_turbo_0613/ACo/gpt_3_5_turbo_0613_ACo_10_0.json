The first statement, 'The cat was outside,' tells us the location of the cat.\n2. The second statement, 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside,' establishes a conditional relationship between the dog and the cat. It states that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n\nBased on this information, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If the cat was outside, it means that the condition in the second statement was satisfied, implying that the dog was inside.\n- However, we cannot definitively conclude that the dog was inside solely based on the given information. It is possible that the dog was outside, and therefore the condition in the second statement was not met.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that 'The dog was inside' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
