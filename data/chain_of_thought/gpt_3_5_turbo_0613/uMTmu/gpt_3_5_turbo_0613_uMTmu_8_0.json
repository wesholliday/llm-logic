It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake. This means that if the vampire is not awake, we cannot determine the state of the mummy.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not the case that the mummy must have been awake. This means that there is a possibility that the mummy was not awake.\n\nBased on these two statements, we cannot definitively infer whether the vampire was awake or not. The information provided does not give us enough information to make a conclusion about the state of the vampire.\n\nAnswer: No",
