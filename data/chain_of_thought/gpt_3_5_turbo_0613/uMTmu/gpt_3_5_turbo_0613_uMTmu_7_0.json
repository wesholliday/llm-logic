If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\n2. It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can conclude that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race. This means that if Chris did not finish the race, then Alex also did not finish the race.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not the case that Chris must have finished the race. This means that Chris may or may not have finished the race.\n\nBased on these two statements, we cannot definitively infer whether Alex finished the race or not. The information provided does not give us enough information to make a conclusion about Alex's participation in the race.\n\nAnswer: No",
