It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow. (Negation of the second part of the conditional statement)\n\nFrom the given information, we can conclude that the banana was not yellow. However, we cannot directly infer the color of the apple based on this information alone. The statement does not provide any information about the color of the apple other than the conditional relationship between the colors of the apple and the banana.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the apple was not red based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
