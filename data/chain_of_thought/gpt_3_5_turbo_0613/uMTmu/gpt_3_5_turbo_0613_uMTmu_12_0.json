It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Joe went to the park, Lucy went to the zoo. However, statement 2 contradicts this inference by stating that Lucy did not necessarily go to the zoo.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively infer whether Joe went to the park or not. The given statements do not provide enough information to make a conclusion about Joe's visit to the park.\n\nAnswer: No",
