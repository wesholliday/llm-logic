This statement establishes a conditional relationship between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis. If Jeff played basketball, it is a requirement that Amy played tennis.\n\n2. It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis. This statement contradicts the previous statement and states that Amy did not necessarily play tennis.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the first statement is false because it is contradicted by the second statement. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about whether Jeff played basketball or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
