If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\n2. It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can conclude that if Mary was present at the wedding, then Sue must have also been present. However, statement 2 contradicts this by saying that Sue does not have to be at the wedding.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively infer whether Mary was at the wedding or not. The given statements do not provide enough information to make a conclusive determination about Mary's presence at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No",
