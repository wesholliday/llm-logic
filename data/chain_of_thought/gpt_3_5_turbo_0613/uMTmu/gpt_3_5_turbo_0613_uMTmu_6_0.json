It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\nFrom statement 2, we can conclude that Bob did not choose pasta. \n\nNow, let's consider the implications of this information on Sue's choice:\n\nIf Sue chose pizza (as stated in statement 1), then Bob must have chosen pasta. But since we know that Bob did not choose pasta (from statement 2), it means that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
