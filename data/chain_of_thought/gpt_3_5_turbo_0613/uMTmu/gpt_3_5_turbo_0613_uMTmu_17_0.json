It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that Kate did not necessarily eat salad. This means that the first part of statement 1 (If Ben ate pasta) is not necessarily true. \n\nSince the first part of statement 1 is not necessarily true, we cannot make any definitive inference about whether Ben ate pasta or not based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
