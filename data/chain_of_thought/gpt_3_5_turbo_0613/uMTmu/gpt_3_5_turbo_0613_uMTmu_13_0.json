It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. This means that if the car was not red, we cannot make any conclusions about the color of the truck.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not the case that the truck must have been blue. This means that the truck could have been a color other than blue.\n\nBased on these two statements, we cannot infer anything about the color of the car. The information provided does not allow us to conclude whether the car was red or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
