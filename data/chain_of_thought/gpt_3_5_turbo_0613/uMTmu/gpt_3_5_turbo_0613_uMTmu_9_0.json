It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nFrom statement 2, we can conclude that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. However, this does not provide any information about whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not. It is possible that Lisa bought the red shirt and Mark bought a different color shirt, or it is possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt at all.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
