It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. This means that if the doll was not plastic, we cannot make any conclusions about the truck.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the truck does not have to be metal. This means that the truck could be made of any material, including plastic.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot infer whether the doll was plastic or not. The information provided does not give us enough evidence to make a conclusion about the material of the doll.\n\nAnswer: No",
