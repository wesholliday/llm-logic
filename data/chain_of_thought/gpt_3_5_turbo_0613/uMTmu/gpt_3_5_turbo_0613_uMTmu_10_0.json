It's not the case that the cat must have been outside.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the dog was inside, then the cat was definitely outside. This means that if the dog was not outside, then the cat was not inside.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not necessary for the cat to be outside. This means that there is a possibility that the cat could be inside.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that it is possible for both the dog and the cat to be inside. Therefore, we cannot infer that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: No",
