It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was also in the forest. However, statement 2 contradicts this by saying that the unicorn must not have been in the forest.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively infer whether the griffin was or was not in the forest. The given statements are contradictory, so we cannot make a conclusive determination about the griffin's location.\n\nAnswer: No",
