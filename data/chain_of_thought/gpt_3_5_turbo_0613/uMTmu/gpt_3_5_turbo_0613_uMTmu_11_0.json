It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. This means that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins could be any flavor.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry. This means that the muffins could be a flavor other than blueberry.\n\nBased on these two statements, we cannot definitively infer that the cake was not chocolate. It is possible that the cake was chocolate, and the muffins were a flavor other than blueberry.\n\nAnswer: No",
