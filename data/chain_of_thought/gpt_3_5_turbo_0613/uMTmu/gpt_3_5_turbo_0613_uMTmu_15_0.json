It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Sam took a plane, Erin took a train. This means that if Sam did not take a plane, Erin could have taken either a train or some other mode of transportation.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not necessary for Erin to have taken a train. This means that Erin could have taken a plane or any other mode of transportation.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot infer whether Sam took a plane or not. The possibility still exists that Sam took a plane, and Erin took a different mode of transportation. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
