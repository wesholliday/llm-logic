It implies that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob would have chosen pasta.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If Bob did not choose pasta, it means that the condition in the second statement (\"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\") was not met. In other words, Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
