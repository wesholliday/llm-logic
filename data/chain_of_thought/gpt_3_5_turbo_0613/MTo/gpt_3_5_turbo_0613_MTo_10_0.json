It does not provide any information about the cat's location inside or whether the dog was inside or outside.\n\n2. \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\": This statement establishes a conditional relationship between the dog being inside and the cat being outside. It implies that if the dog was inside, then the cat cannot be outside.\n\nBased on the given information, we can conclude that if the cat was not outside, it means the cat was either inside or in an unknown location. However, we cannot definitively infer whether the dog was inside or outside based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
