            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"The apple was not red\" from the given statements, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. \"The banana was not yellow\": This statement tells us that the banana was a color other than yellow.\n\n2. \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\": This statement establishes a conditional relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana. It states that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If the banana was not yellow (as stated in the first statement), then the condition of the conditional statement in the second statement is not met. In other words, the antecedent of the conditional statement is false.\n\n- When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the truth value of the conditional statement as a whole is not determined. It could be either true or false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty whether \"The apple was not red\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
