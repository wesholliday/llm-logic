It implies that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If Jen did not watch basketball, it means that the condition in the second statement is not satisfied. This means that Tom did not watch football.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
