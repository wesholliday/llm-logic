It states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If the muffins were not blueberry, it means they were some other flavor.\n- If the muffins were blueberry, it means the cake must have been chocolate.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer the flavor of the cake from the given statements. The statements only provide information about the muffins and their relationship to the cake, but they do not provide any direct information about the cake itself.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer whether \"The cake was not chocolate\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
