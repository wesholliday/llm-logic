            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"The griffin was not in the forest\" from the given statements, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. \"The unicorn was not in the forest.\"\n   This statement tells us that the unicorn was not present in the forest.\n\n2. \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n   This statement establishes a conditional relationship between the griffin and the unicorn. It states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was also in the forest.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If the unicorn was not in the forest (as stated in the first statement), then the condition in the second statement is not fulfilled. This means that the griffin cannot be in the forest because the condition for the unicorn being in the forest is not met.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
