It implies that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n- If the robot did not visit Jupiter (as stated in the first statement), then the conditional relationship in the second statement does not provide any information about the alien visiting Mars. It could be the case that the alien visited Mars or did not visit Mars, and it would not affect the robot's visit to Jupiter.\n\nBased on this analysis, we cannot infer \"The alien did not visit Mars\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
