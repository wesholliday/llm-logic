It implies that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate definitely ate the salad.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If Kate did not eat the salad, it means that Ben did not eat pasta. This is because the second statement establishes that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad. Since we know Kate did not eat the salad, it implies that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
