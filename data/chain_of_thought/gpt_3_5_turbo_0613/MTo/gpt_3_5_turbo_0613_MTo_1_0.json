If Mary was at the wedding:\n   - According to statement 2, Sue would have been at the wedding.\n   - However, statement 1 tells us that Sue was not at the wedding.\n   - This creates a contradiction, as both statements cannot be true simultaneously.\n\n2. If Mary was not at the wedding:\n   - Since Mary did not attend the wedding, the conditional statement in statement 2 does not apply.\n   - There is no contradiction with statement 1, as it does not mention anything about Mary.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
