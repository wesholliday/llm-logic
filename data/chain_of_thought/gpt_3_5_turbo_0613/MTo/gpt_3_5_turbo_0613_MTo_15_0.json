It implies that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If Erin did not take a train, it means that the condition in the second statement (\"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\") is not satisfied. In other words, Sam did not take a plane.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
