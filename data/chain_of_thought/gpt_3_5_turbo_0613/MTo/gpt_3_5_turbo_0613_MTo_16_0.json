It states that if the shirt was made of cotton, then the pants were made of denim.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of these statements:\n\n- If the pants were not denim, it means that the condition in the second statement (\"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\") was not met. In other words, the shirt was not made of cotton.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer that \"The shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
