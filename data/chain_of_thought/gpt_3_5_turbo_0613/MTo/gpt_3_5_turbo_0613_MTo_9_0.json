It implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark definitely bought the blue shirt.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then it is not possible to determine whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not.\n- If Mark did buy the blue shirt, then it is possible that Lisa bought the red shirt, but we cannot be certain.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
