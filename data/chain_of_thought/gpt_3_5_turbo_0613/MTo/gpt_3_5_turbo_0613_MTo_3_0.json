This means that it does not fall into the category of mystery novels.\n\nStatement 2 introduces a conditional statement. It states that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. This means that if the book is indeed a mystery novel, then it must have been written by James.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer that the book was not written by James?\n\nIf the book is not a mystery novel (as stated in Statement 1), then it cannot have been written by James (as stated in Statement 2). This is because Statement 2 establishes a direct relationship between James being the author and the book being a mystery novel. If the book is not a mystery novel, it contradicts the condition set in Statement 2.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
