It implies that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If Amy did not play tennis, it means that the condition in the second statement (\"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\") was not met. In other words, Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'Jeff did not play basketball' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
