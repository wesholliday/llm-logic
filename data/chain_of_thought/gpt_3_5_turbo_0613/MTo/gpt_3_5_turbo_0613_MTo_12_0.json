It implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If Lucy did not go to the zoo, it means that the condition in the second statement (\"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\") was not fulfilled. In other words, Joe did not go to the park.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
