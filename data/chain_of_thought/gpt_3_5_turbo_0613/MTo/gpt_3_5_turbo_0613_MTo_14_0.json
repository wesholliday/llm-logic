            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"The bear was not in the cave\" from the given statements, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. \"The wolf was not in the den.\"\n   This statement tells us that the wolf was not in the den.\n\n2. \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\"\n   This statement establishes a conditional relationship between the bear being in the cave and the wolf being in the den. It implies that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf must be in the den.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If the wolf was not in the den, it means the condition in the second statement (\"the bear was in the cave\") was not met. This is because the second statement states that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf is in the den. Since the wolf was not in the den, it implies that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
