It states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris also finished the race.\n\nBased on these statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n1. If Chris did not finish the race, then the conditional statement in Statement 2 is automatically true, regardless of whether Alex finished the race or not. This is because the conditional statement only requires that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. It does not make any claims about what happens if Chris did not finish the race.\n\n2. Therefore, the fact that Chris did not finish the race does not provide any information about whether Alex finished the race or not.\n\n3. Consequently, we cannot infer whether Alex did or did not finish the race based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
