It states that if the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- Since the truck was not blue, it means that the car was not red, because if the car were red, the truck would have been blue according to the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The car was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
