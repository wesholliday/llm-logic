It states that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. This statement does not provide any information about whether Ben actually ate pasta or not.\n\nThe second statement, \"Kate ate salad,\" is a separate piece of information. It tells us that Kate ate salad, but it does not provide any direct information about whether Ben ate pasta or not.\n\nBased on the given statements alone, we cannot logically infer whether Ben ate pasta or not. The first statement only establishes a conditional relationship between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating salad, but it does not provide any information about whether the condition (Ben eating pasta) is true or not. The second statement does not provide any direct information about Ben's actions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
