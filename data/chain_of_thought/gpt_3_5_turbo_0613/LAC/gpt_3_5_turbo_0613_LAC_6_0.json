It establishes a relationship between Sue choosing pizza and Bob choosing pasta. It does not provide any information about what Sue actually chose.\n\nThe second statement, \"Bob chose pasta,\" tells us that Bob chose pasta. It does not provide any information about Sue's choice.\n\nBased on these statements alone, we cannot logically infer what Sue chose. The first statement only establishes a relationship between Sue choosing pizza and Bob choosing pasta, but it does not tell us anything about Sue's actual choice. The second statement only provides information about Bob's choice.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
