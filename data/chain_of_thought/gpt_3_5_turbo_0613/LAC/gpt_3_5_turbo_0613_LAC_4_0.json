This statement establishes a conditional relationship between the alien visiting Mars and the robot visiting Jupiter.\n\nFrom Statement 2, we are given the information that the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that the alien visited Mars, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. If the robot visiting Jupiter is a sufficient condition for the alien visiting Mars, then we can conclude that the alien visited Mars based on the given information.\n\nHowever, if the robot visiting Jupiter is not a sufficient condition for the alien visiting Mars, then we cannot logically infer that the alien visited Mars based on the given information.\n\nTo make this determination, we need to consider the possibility that there could be other conditions or factors that could result in the robot visiting Jupiter without the alien visiting Mars.\n\nAnswer: No",
