This statement establishes a conditional relationship between Sam and Erin's modes of transportation.\n\nFrom Statement 2, we are given the information that Erin took a train.\n\nTo determine if Sam took a plane, we need to consider the logical implications of the given statements. If the first statement is true, and Erin took a train (as stated in the second statement), then it is logically possible that Sam took a plane. However, it is also possible that Sam took a different mode of transportation or did not travel at all.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively infer that Sam took a plane.\n\nAnswer: No",
