This means that if the antecedent (Joe going to the park) is true, then the consequent (Lucy going to the zoo) must also be true.\n\nFrom Statement 2, we are given the information that Lucy went to the zoo. This statement does not provide any direct information about Joe.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot logically infer whether Joe went to the park or not. The information about Lucy going to the zoo does not provide any direct information about Joe's actions. It is possible that Joe went to the park, but it is also possible that he did not. Therefore, we cannot make a definite inference about Joe going to the park based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
