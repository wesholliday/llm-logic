            "content": "To determine if we can logically infer that the vampire was awake, we need to analyze the given statements. \n\nThe first statement, \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake,\" establishes a conditional relationship between the vampire and the mummy. It states that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake. \n\nThe second statement, \"The mummy was awake,\" provides information about the mummy's state of being. It tells us that the mummy was indeed awake. \n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that if the mummy was awake, it satisfies the condition in the first statement. Therefore, we can logically infer that the vampire was awake as well. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
