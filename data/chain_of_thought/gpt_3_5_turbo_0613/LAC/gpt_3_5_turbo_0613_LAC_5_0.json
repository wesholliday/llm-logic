It states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. This does not provide any information about whether Jeff actually played basketball or not.\n\nThe second statement, \"Amy played tennis,\" tells us that Amy did play tennis. However, it does not provide any direct information about Jeff's activities.\n\nBased on the given statements alone, we cannot logically infer whether Jeff played basketball or not. The first statement only establishes a relationship between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis, but it does not provide any information about Jeff's actual participation in basketball. The second statement only confirms Amy's participation in tennis.\n\nAnswer: No",
