In this case, we need to show that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\n\nHowever, the given statements do not provide any direct information about Lisa's purchase. We only have information about Mark's purchase. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that Lisa bought the red shirt based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
