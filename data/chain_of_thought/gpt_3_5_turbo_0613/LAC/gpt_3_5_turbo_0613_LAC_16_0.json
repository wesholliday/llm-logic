However, we cannot directly conclude that the shirt was cotton based on the given information. The first statement only establishes a relationship between the shirt being cotton and the pants being denim, but it does not provide any information about the shirt itself.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that the shirt was cotton based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
