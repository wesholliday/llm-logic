However, this does not necessarily mean that James is the only author who writes mystery novels. There could be other authors who also write mystery novels.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the book in question is a mystery novel. This statement does not provide any information about the author of the book.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot logically infer that the book was written by James. The information provided is not sufficient to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No",
