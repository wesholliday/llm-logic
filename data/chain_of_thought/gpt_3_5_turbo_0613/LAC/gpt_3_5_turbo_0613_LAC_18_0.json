This means that if the doll is not plastic, we cannot conclude anything about the truck.\n\nFrom Statement 2, we know that the truck was metal. However, this does not provide any information about the doll.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that the doll was plastic based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
