This means that whenever the cake is chocolate, the muffins will always be blueberry.\n\nFrom statement 2, we are given the information that the muffins were indeed blueberry.\n\nNow, based on these two statements, we can conclude that the muffins were blueberry. However, we cannot definitively infer that the cake was chocolate. It is possible that the cake could be a different flavor, or it could be chocolate. We do not have enough information to make a conclusive inference about the flavor of the cake.\n\nAnswer: No",
