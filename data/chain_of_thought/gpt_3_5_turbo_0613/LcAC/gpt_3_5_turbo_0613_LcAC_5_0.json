It states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. This does not provide any information about whether Jeff actually played basketball or not. It only establishes a relationship between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis.\n\nThe second statement, \"Amy played tennis,\" tells us that Amy did indeed play tennis. However, this statement does not provide any direct information about Jeff's activities.\n\nBased on the given statements alone, we cannot logically conclude whether Jeff played basketball or not. The first statement only establishes a relationship between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis, but it does not provide any information about Jeff's actual actions. The second statement only confirms that Amy played tennis, but it does not provide any information about Jeff.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
