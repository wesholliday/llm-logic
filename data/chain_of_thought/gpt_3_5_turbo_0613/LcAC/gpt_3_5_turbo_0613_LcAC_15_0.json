However, this does not necessarily mean that Sam actually took a plane. It only establishes a conditional relationship between Sam taking a plane and Erin taking a train.\n\nFrom Statement 2, we know that Erin took a train. This information does not provide any direct information about Sam's mode of transportation.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot logically conclude that Sam took a plane.",
