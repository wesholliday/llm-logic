It states that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. This does not provide any information about whether Ben actually ate pasta or not. It only establishes a relationship between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating salad.\n\nThe second statement, \"Kate ate salad,\" tells us that Kate indeed ate salad. This statement does not provide any direct information about Ben's actions.\n\nBased on the given statements alone, we cannot logically conclude that Ben ate pasta. The first statement only establishes a relationship between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating salad, but it does not provide any information about Ben's actual actions. The second statement only confirms that Kate ate salad, but it does not provide any information about Ben.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
