It establishes a relationship between Alex and Chris, stating that if Alex finished the race, then Chris also finished the race. This statement does not provide any information about whether Alex actually finished the race or not.\n\nThe second statement, \"Chris finished the race,\" tells us that Chris indeed finished the race. However, this statement alone does not provide any direct information about Alex's participation or completion of the race.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot logically conclude that Alex finished the race. The first statement only establishes a relationship between Alex and Chris, and the second statement only confirms Chris's completion of the race. We do not have any direct information about Alex's participation or completion of the race.\n\nAnswer: No",
