This means that if the antecedent (Joe going to the park) is true, then the consequent (Lucy going to the zoo) must also be true.\n\nFrom Statement 2, we are given the information that Lucy went to the zoo. This statement does not provide any information about Joe.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot logically conclude whether Joe went to the park or not. The information provided does not directly or indirectly establish a relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive conclusion about Joe's visit to the park based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
