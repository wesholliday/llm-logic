It establishes a relationship between Mary being at the wedding and Sue being at the wedding. It does not provide any information about whether Mary was actually at the wedding or not.\n\nThe second statement, \"Sue was at the wedding,\" tells us that Sue was indeed present at the wedding.\n\nBased on these two statements alone, we cannot definitively conclude whether Mary was at the wedding or not. The first statement only establishes a hypothetical relationship between Mary and Sue's presence at the wedding, and the second statement only confirms Sue's presence.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
