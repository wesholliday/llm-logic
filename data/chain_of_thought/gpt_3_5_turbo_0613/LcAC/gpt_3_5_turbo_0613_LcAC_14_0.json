However, this does not necessarily mean that the bear was in the cave. It only establishes a conditional relationship between the bear and the wolf.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the wolf was indeed in the den. This information does not provide any direct information about the bear's location.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot logically conclude that the bear was in the cave.\n\nAnswer: No",
