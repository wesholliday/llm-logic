This statement establishes a conditional relationship between the griffin and the unicorn.\n\nStatement 2 directly states that the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that if the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was also in the forest. This is because Statement 1 establishes a logical connection between the griffin and the unicorn, and Statement 2 confirms the presence of the unicorn in the forest.\n\nTherefore, the logical conclusion is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
