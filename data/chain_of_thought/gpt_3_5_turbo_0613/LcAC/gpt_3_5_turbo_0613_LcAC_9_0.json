This does not provide any information about whether Lisa actually bought the red shirt or not.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that Mark bought the blue shirt. However, this does not provide any direct information about Lisa's purchase.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot logically conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: No",
