It implies that if James is the author, then the book is definitely a mystery novel.\n\nStatement 2: \"The book is a mystery novel.\"\nThis statement tells us that the book in question is indeed a mystery novel.\n\nTo determine if we can conclude that James is the author, we need to check if the given statements satisfy the logical condition established in Statement 1.\n\nIf the book is a mystery novel, it could have been written by James, but it could also have been written by someone else. The given statements do not provide any direct information about the authorship of the book. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that the book was written by James based solely on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
