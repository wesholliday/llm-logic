It does not provide any information about the truth value of either option individually.\n\n2. \"The splat is not quanked\": This statement provides information about the splat not being quanked. It does not provide any information about whether the splat is morphed or not.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot directly infer that \"The splat is morphed.\" The first statement only presents a disjunction, and the second statement does not provide any information about the morphed status of the splat.\n\nAnswer: No",
