So, either the flugel is blimmed or it is zargled.\n\n2. \"The flugel is not zargled\" - This statement tells us that the flugel is not zargled.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that if the flugel is not zargled, then it must be blimmed. This is because the first statement tells us that one of the options must be true, and since the flugel is not zargled, the only remaining option is that it is blimmed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Yes, we can infer that \"The flugel is blimmed.\"",
