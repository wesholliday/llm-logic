It states that the fleeg is not surned.\n\nGiven these statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If the fleeg is bluttered, then the first condition in the disjunction is true.\n- If the fleeg is not surned, then the second condition in the disjunction is false.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively infer that \"The fleeg is bluttered\" from the given statements. It is possible that the fleeg is neither bluttered nor surned. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
