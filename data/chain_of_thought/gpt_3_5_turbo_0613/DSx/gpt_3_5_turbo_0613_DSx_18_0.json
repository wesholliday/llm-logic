It does not provide any information about which one is true.\n\n2. \"The shank is not nugged\" - This statement tells us that the shank is not nugged. It eliminates the possibility of the shank being nugged.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that the shank cannot be nugged. However, we still don't have any information about whether the shank is plooked or not. The first statement only tells us that the shank must be either plooked or nugged, but it does not provide any information about which one is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The shank is plooked\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
