The statement 'Either the wug is sproinged or it is garpled' tells us that one of two possibilities must be true: either the wug is sproinged or it is garpled.\n\n2. The statement 'The wug is not garpled' tells us that the wug is not garpled.\n\n3. If the wug is not garpled, then the possibility of it being garpled is eliminated.\n\n4. Since the possibility of the wug being garpled is eliminated, the only remaining possibility is that the wug is sproinged.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can infer that 'The wug is sproinged'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
