The statement \"Either the flob is skizzled or it is movated\" tells us that one of two possibilities must be true: either the flob is skizzled or it is movated.\n\n2. The statement \"The flob is not movated\" tells us that the flob is not movated.\n\n3. Combining these two statements, we know that the flob cannot be movated.\n\n4. Since the flob cannot be movated, the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that the flob is skizzled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The flob is skizzled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
