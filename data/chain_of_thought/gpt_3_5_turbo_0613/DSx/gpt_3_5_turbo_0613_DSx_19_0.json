However, we don't have any specific information about whether it is vreebled or plagged.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the smonk is not plagged. This means that the possibility of the smonk being plagged is eliminated.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the smonk must be vreebled because it cannot be plagged. Therefore, we can infer \"The smonk is vreebled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
