The statement \"Either the flug is blummed or it is zimmed\" tells us that one of two possibilities must be true: either the flug is blummed or it is zimmed.\n\n2. The statement \"The flug is not zimmed\" tells us that the flug is not zimmed.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that if the flug is not zimmed, then it must be blummed. This is because the first statement tells us that one of the two possibilities must be true, and since the flug is not zimmed, the only remaining possibility is that it is blummed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
