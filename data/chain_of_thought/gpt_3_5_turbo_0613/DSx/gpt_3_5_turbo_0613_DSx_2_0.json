So, if the wug is not flooped, then it must be bimmed.\n\nThe second statement is \"The wug is not bimmed.\" This statement tells us that the wug is not bimmed, which means that the option of the wug being bimmed is false.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that the wug is not bimmed. However, we cannot directly infer that the wug is flooped because the first statement allows for the possibility that the wug is bimmed. Therefore, we cannot infer that the wug is flooped.\n\nAnswer: No",
