This means that at least one of these statements is true.\n\nFrom Statement 2, we know that the grommet is not plopped. This means that the second possibility mentioned in Statement 1 (that the grommet is plopped) is false.\n\nTherefore, the only remaining possibility is that the grommet is sploffed. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
