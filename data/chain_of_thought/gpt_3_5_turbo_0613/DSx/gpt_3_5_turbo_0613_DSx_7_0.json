It does not provide any information about which one is true.\n\n2. \"The whiffle is not tinked\": This statement tells us that the whiffle is not tinked. It does not provide any information about whether the whiffle is shanked or not.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot directly infer that \"The whiffle is shanked.\" The first statement only gives us two possibilities, and the second statement rules out one of those possibilities (tinked), but it does not confirm the other possibility (shanked).\n\nAnswer: No",
