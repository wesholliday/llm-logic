It leaves open the possibility that the missing sock could be somewhere else.\n\nStatement 2: \"Either the missing sock must be under the bed or it's in the laundry basket.\"\nThis statement presents two possibilities: either the missing sock is under the bed or it's in the laundry basket. It does not exclude any other locations.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that the missing sock is not under the bed, but it could still be in the laundry basket or another location. We cannot definitively infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
