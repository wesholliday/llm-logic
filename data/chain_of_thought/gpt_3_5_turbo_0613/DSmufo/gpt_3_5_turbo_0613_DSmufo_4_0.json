It leaves open the possibility that the cat could be doing something else.\n\n2. \"Either the cat must be playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch.\"\n   This statement presents two possibilities: either the cat is playing in the bedroom or it is napping on the couch. It does not exclude other possibilities.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that the cat is not necessarily playing in the bedroom, but it could be napping on the couch. However, we cannot definitively infer that the cat is napping on the couch because there is still a possibility that it is doing something else.\n\nAnswer: No",
