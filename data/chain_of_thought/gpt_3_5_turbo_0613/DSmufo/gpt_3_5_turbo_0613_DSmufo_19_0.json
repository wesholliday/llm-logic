In other words, the watch may or may not be on his wrist.\n\n2. \"Either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser.\"\n   This statement presents two possibilities: either the watch is on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser. It does not exclude the possibility of the watch being on his wrist.\n\nBased on these two statements, we cannot definitively infer that \"The watch is charging on the dresser.\" The second statement allows for the possibility that the watch is on his wrist. Therefore, we do not have enough information to conclude that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: No",
