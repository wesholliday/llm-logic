It leaves open the possibility that the pen could be somewhere else.\n\n2. \"Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag\" - This statement presents two possibilities: either the pen is on the desk or it is in the bag. It does not exclude the possibility of the pen being in the bag.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that the pen could be in the bag because it is not required to be on the desk. However, we cannot definitively infer that the pen is in the bag because it could still be on the desk.\n\nAnswer: No",
