In other words, Fido being in the garden is not a requirement.\n\n2. \"Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside\" - This statement presents two possibilities: either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside. It does not exclude the possibility of Fido being inside.\n\nBased on the given information, we can conclude that Fido could be inside. However, we cannot definitively infer that Fido is inside because the statement does not provide enough information to determine Fido's exact location.\n\nAnswer: No",
