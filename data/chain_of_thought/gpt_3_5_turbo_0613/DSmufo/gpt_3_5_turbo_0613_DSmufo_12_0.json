In other words, the jacket may or may not be in the closet.\n\n2. \"Either the jacket must be hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair.\"\n   This statement presents two possibilities: either the jacket is in the closet or it is draped over the chair. It does not exclude the possibility of the jacket being in the closet.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot definitively infer that \"The jacket is draped over the chair.\" The statement allows for the possibility that the jacket could be in the closet.",
