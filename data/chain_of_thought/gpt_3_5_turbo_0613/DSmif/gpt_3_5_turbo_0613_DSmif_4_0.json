It implies that one of these two options must be true.\n\n2. \"The cat isn't playing in the bedroom.\"\n   This statement tells us that the cat is not playing in the bedroom. It eliminates one of the possibilities mentioned in the first statement.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If the cat is not playing in the bedroom, then the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
