However, since the second statement allows for the possibility that Fido is not in the garden, we cannot conclude that Fido is in the garden.\n\n- If Fido is inside, then both statements are true. Fido is either in the garden or inside (first statement), and there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden (second statement).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'Fido is inside.'\n\nAnswer: Yes",
