The book might not be resting on the table.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the book must be either on the table or on the shelf. This means that one of these two options must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the book might not be resting on the table. This means that the possibility of the book being on the table is not certain.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively infer that the book is on the shelf. It is still possible that the book is on the table, even though it is not certain.\n\nAnswer: No",
