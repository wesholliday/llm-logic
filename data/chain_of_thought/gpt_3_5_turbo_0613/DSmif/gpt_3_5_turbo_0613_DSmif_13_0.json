This means that these are the only two possible locations for the toy.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf. This means that one of the possibilities mentioned in statement 1 (the toy being on the bookshelf) is eliminated.\n\nTherefore, the only remaining possibility is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
