It implies that the missing sock must be in one of these two places.\n\n2. \"The missing sock isn't under the bed.\"\n   This statement eliminates one of the possibilities mentioned in the first statement. It tells us that the missing sock is not under the bed.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that the missing sock must be in the laundry basket. This is because if it is not under the bed (as stated in the second statement), then it must be in the other possible location mentioned in the first statement, which is the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
