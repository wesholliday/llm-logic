This means that one of these two options must be true.\n\nStatement 2 introduces the possibility that the jacket might not be hanging in the closet. This means that the first option mentioned in Statement 1 (the jacket hanging in the closet) is not necessarily true.\n\nHowever, this does not provide enough information to conclude that the jacket is draped over the chair. It is still possible that the jacket is neither hanging in the closet nor draped over the chair. There could be other locations where the jacket might be.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: No",
