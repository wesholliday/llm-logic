The watch might not be on his wrist.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the watch must be either on his wrist or charging on the dresser. This means that these are the only two possibilities for the location of the watch.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the watch might not be on his wrist. This means that one of the possibilities mentioned in statement 1 (the watch being on his wrist) is not true.\n\nTherefore, the only remaining possibility is that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
