This means that it cannot be anywhere else.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that there is a possibility that the newspaper is not on the porch. This means that it is still possible for the newspaper to be in the driveway.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The newspaper is in the driveway.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
