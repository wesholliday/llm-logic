This means that one of these two options must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the sunglasses might not be on her head. This means that the possibility of the sunglasses being on her head is uncertain.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively infer that the sunglasses are in her bag. It is still possible that the sunglasses are on her head, even though it is uncertain. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
