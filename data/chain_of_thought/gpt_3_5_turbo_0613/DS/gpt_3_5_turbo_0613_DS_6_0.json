The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the phone is not ringing in the kitchen, then it must be in the living room. This is because the first statement states that either the phone is in the living room or it is ringing in the kitchen. If the phone is not ringing in the kitchen, then the only possibility left is that it is in the living room.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
