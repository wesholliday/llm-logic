The statement 'Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden' tells us that Fido is either inside or in the garden. This means that Fido cannot be both inside and in the garden at the same time.\n\n2. The statement 'Fido is not in the garden' tells us that Fido is not in the garden. This eliminates the possibility of Fido being in the garden.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that Fido must be inside. Since there are no other possibilities mentioned, the only remaining option is that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
