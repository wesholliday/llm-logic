However, we don't have any information about the specific location of the scarf.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the scarf is not on the coat rack. This eliminates one possibility mentioned in Statement 1, but it doesn't provide any information about whether the scarf is in the backpack or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: No",
