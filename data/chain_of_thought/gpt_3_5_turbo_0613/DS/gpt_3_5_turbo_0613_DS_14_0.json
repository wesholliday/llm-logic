It states that the milk is either on the counter or chilling in the fridge. Since we know that the milk is not chilling in the fridge (from statement 2), the only remaining possibility is that the milk is on the counter.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
