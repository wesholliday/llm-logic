It implies that one of these two options must be true.\n\nStatement 2: \"The cat isn't playing in the bedroom.\"\nThis statement tells us that the cat is not playing in the bedroom. It eliminates one of the possibilities mentioned in Statement 1.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that if the cat is not playing in the bedroom, then the only remaining possibility from Statement 1 is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
