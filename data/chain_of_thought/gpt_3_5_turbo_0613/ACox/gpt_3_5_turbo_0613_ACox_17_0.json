It states that if the whiffle was shanked, then it was tinked.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If the whiffle was tinked, it does not necessarily mean that it was shanked. The first statement does not provide any information about shanking.\n\n- However, if the whiffle was shanked, then it was tinked. This is implied by the second statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The whiffle was shanked\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
