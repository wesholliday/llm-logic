It does not provide any information about whether the fribble was snurgled or not.\n\n2. \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\" - This statement establishes a conditional relationship. It states that if the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked. However, it does not tell us whether the fribble was actually snurgled or not.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot directly infer whether \"The fribble was snurgled\" or not. The statements only provide information about the fribble crinking and the conditional relationship between snurgling and crinking, but they do not give us any direct information about whether the fribble was snurgled or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
