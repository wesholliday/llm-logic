It states that if the flugel was blimmed, then it was zargled.\n\nBased on these statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If the flugel was zargled, it does not necessarily mean that it was blimmed. The first statement does not provide any information about the flugel being blimmed.\n\n- However, if the flugel was blimmed, then we can conclude that it was zargled. This is because the second statement explicitly states that if the flugel was blimmed, then it was zargled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The flugel was blimmed\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
