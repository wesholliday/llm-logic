            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nThe first premise states that \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"Ben ate pasta\" and the consequent is \"Kate ate salad.\" \n\nThe second premise states that \"Ben ate pasta.\" \n\nFrom these premises, we can use modus ponens, a valid deductive inference rule, to conclude that \"Kate ate salad.\" Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we also have A, then we can validly infer B. \n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
