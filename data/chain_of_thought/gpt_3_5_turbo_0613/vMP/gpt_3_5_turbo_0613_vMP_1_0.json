            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nThe first premise states that \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and the consequent is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe second premise states that \"Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\nGiven these premises, we can use modus ponens, a valid form of deductive reasoning, to draw the conclusion. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (if-then statement) and the antecedent is true, then we can conclude that the consequent is also true.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is a conditional statement, and the second premise confirms that the antecedent of the conditional statement is true. Therefore, we can logically conclude that the consequent is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
