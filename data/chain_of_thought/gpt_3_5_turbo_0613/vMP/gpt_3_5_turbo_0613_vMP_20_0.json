            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nThe first premise states that \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"the apple was red\" and the consequent is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\nThe second premise states that \"The apple was red.\"\n\nGiven these premises, we can use the principle of modus ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, then we can conclude that B is true.\n\nIn this case, the first premise can be rewritten as \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" Since the second premise states that \"The apple was red,\" we can apply modus ponens and conclude that \"The banana was yellow.\"\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The banana was yellow\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
