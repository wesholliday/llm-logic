            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nThe first premise states that \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"the vampire was awake\" and the consequent is \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\nThe second premise states that \"The vampire was awake.\" This is a straightforward statement.\n\nIf we assume that both premises are true, we can use the principle of modus ponens to draw a valid conclusion. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, then we can conclude that B is true.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is a conditional statement, and the second premise confirms that the antecedent of the conditional statement is true. Therefore, we can conclude that the consequent is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
