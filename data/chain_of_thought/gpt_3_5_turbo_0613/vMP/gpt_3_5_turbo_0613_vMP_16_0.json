            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nThe first premise states that \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"the shirt was cotton\" and the consequent is \"the pants were denim.\"\n\nThe second premise states that \"The shirt was cotton.\"\n\nIf we assume that both premises are true, we can use the principle of modus ponens to draw a valid conclusion. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, then we can conclude that B is true.\n\nIn this case, the first premise can be rewritten as \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" (A -> B). The second premise is \"The shirt was cotton\" (A). By applying modus ponens, we can conclude that \"The pants were denim\" (B).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
