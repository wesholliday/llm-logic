Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we also have A, then we can infer B.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is a conditional statement, and the second premise matches the antecedent of that conditional statement. Therefore, we can conclude that the consequent, \"the robot visited Jupiter,\" follows logically.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
