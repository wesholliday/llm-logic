            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nThe first premise states that \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"Tom watched football\" and the consequent is \"Jen watched basketball.\" \n\nThe second premise states that \"Tom watched football.\" \n\nGiven these premises, we can use modus ponens, a valid deductive argument form, to draw the conclusion. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we also have A, then we can conclude B. \n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" (A: Tom watched football, B: Jen watched basketball), and we also have A (Tom watched football). Therefore, we can validly conclude B (Jen watched basketball). \n\nAnswer: Yes",
