            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nThe first premise states that \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"the doll was plastic\" and the consequent is \"the truck was metal.\" \n\nThe second premise states that \"The doll was plastic.\" \n\nGiven these premises, we can use the principle of modus ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, then we can conclude that B is true. \n\nIn this case, the first premise is a conditional statement, and the second premise confirms that the antecedent of the conditional statement is true. Therefore, we can validly conclude that the consequent of the conditional statement is true, which is \"The truck was metal.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
