            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nThe first premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and the consequent is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThe second premise states that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nGiven these premises, we can conclude that Mark bought the blue shirt. This conclusion follows logically because it aligns with the conditional statement in the first premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
