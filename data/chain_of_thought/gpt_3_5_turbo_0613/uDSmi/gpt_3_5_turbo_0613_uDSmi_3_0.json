Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\n2. The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the keys are either in the drawer or dangling in the cabinet. This means that one of these two options must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet. This means that it is possible for the keys to be in the drawer.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that the keys could be in the drawer, but we cannot definitively conclude that they are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: No",
