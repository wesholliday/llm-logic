The phone might not be ringing in the kitchen.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can conclude that if the phone is not in the living room, then it must be ringing in the kitchen. \n\nHowever, statement 2 introduces uncertainty by saying that the phone might not be ringing in the kitchen. This means that there is a possibility that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen, even though it is not in the living room.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot definitively infer that the phone is in the living room.",
