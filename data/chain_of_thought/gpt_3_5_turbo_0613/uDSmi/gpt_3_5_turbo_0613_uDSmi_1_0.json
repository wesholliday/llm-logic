Fido might not be in the garden.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that Fido is either inside or in the garden. However, statement 2 tells us that Fido might not be in the garden, which means there is a possibility that Fido is inside.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that Fido could be inside, but we cannot definitively conclude that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: No",
