The cat is either napping on the couch or playing in the bedroom.\n2. It is also possible that the cat is not playing in the bedroom.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that one of the possibilities is that the cat is napping on the couch. However, the second statement introduces the possibility that the cat might not be playing in the bedroom. This means that there is still a chance that the cat is playing in the bedroom, even though it is not the only possibility.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: No",
