The watch might not be on his wrist.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can conclude that if the watch is not charging on the dresser, then it must be on his wrist. This is because the statement says that either one of these conditions must be true.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that there is a possibility that the watch is not on his wrist.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that if the watch is not on his wrist, then it must be charging on the dresser. However, we cannot definitively conclude that the watch is charging on the dresser because there is still a possibility that the watch is on his wrist.\n\nAnswer: No",
