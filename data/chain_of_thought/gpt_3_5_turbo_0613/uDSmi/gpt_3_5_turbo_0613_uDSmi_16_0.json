The pen might not be on my desk.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the pen is either in the bag or on the desk. However, statement 2 introduces uncertainty by saying that the pen might not be on the desk. This means that there is a possibility that the pen is not on the desk.\n\nGiven this information, we cannot definitively infer that the pen is in the bag. It is still possible that the pen is on the desk, even though it might not be. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
