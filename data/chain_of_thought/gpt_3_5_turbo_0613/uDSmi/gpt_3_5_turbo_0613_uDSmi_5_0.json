The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can conclude that if the cookies are not in the jar, then they must be hidden in the pantry. This is because the first statement presents two options: either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry.\n\nHowever, statement 2 introduces the possibility that the cookies might not be hidden in the pantry. This means that there is a chance that the cookies are not in the pantry.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot definitively infer that the cookies are in the jar. The possibility remains that they could be in the pantry or somewhere else entirely.\n\nAnswer: No",
