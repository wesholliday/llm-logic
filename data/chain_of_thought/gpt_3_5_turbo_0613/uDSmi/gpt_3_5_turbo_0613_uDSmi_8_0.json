The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the remote control is either on the coffee table or under the couch. However, statement 2 tells us that it is possible that the remote control is not under the couch.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively infer that the remote control is on the coffee table. It could still be under the couch, as statement 2 allows for that possibility.\n\nAnswer: No",
