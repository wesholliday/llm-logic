The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the jacket is either draped over the chair or hanging in the closet. This means that these are the only two possibilities for the jacket's location.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the jacket might not be hanging in the closet. This means that one of the possibilities mentioned in statement 1 (hanging in the closet) is not guaranteed.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot infer that the jacket is draped over the chair. It is still possible that the jacket is hanging in the closet, even though it is not guaranteed.\n\nAnswer: No",
