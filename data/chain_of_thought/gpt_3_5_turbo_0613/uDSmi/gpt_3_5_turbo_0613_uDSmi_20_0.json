The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can conclude that the sunglasses are either in her bag or on her head. However, we cannot determine which one is true based on this statement alone.\n\nStatement 2 introduces the possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. This means that the sunglasses could be in her bag, as stated in statement 1, or they could be somewhere else entirely.\n\nGiven this information, we cannot definitively infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.",
