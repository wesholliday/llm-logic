The book might not be resting on the table.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can conclude that if the book is not on the shelf, then it must be resting on the table. This is because the statement says that one of these two conditions must be true.\n\nHowever, statement 2 introduces uncertainty by saying that the book might not be resting on the table. This means that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively infer that the book is on the shelf. There is a possibility that it is on the table or even somewhere else. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
