It implies that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal.\n\n2. \"The truck might not have been metal.\"\n   This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the truck was not metal. It does not provide any information about the doll.\n\nBased on these statements, we cannot directly infer that 'The doll was not plastic.' The second statement only provides information about the truck, not the doll. It is possible that the doll could still be plastic, even if the truck was not metal.",
