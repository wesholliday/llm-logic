            "content": "To determine if we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding, we need to analyze the given statements logically.\n\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\"\nThis statement establishes a conditional relationship between Mary being at the wedding and Sue being at the wedding. It implies that if Mary was present, Sue must also be present.\n\n2. \"Sue might not have been at the wedding.\"\nThis statement suggests that there is a possibility that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nBased on these statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If Sue was not at the wedding, it does not necessarily mean that Mary was not at the wedding. The first statement only establishes a relationship between Mary and Sue being present together, but it does not imply that Mary cannot be present without Sue.\n\n- If Sue was at the wedding, it does not necessarily mean that Mary was at the wedding. The second statement suggests that Sue might not have been at the wedding, but it does not provide any information about Mary's presence.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty whether Mary was or was not at the wedding based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
