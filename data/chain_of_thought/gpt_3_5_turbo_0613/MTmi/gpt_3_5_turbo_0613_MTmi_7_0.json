This is because the statement establishes a conditional relationship between Alex and Chris's race completion.\n\nHowever, statement 2 introduces the possibility that Chris might not have finished the race. This means that there is uncertainty regarding Chris's race completion.\n\nBased on these two statements, we cannot definitively infer that Alex did not finish the race. It is possible that Alex finished the race, and Chris either finished or did not finish. The information provided does not establish a direct relationship between Alex's race completion and Chris's race completion.\n\nAnswer: No",
