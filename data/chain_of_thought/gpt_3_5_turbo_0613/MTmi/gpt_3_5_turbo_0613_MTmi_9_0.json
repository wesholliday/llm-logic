            "content": "To determine if we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, we need to analyze the given statements.\n\n1. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\"\nThis statement establishes a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. It implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then it is necessary for Mark to have bought the blue shirt.\n\n2. \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\"\nThis statement suggests that there is a possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nBased on these statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n- Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\n\nIf Mark did not buy the blue shirt, it means that the condition in the first statement is not satisfied. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: No",
