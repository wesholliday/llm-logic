This is a conditional statement.\n\nFrom statement 2, we are told that Erin might not have taken a train. This means there is a possibility that Erin did not take a train.\n\nBased on these statements, we cannot definitively infer that Sam did not take a plane. It is still possible that Sam took a plane, and Erin did not take a train. The given information does not provide enough evidence to make a conclusive inference about Sam's mode of transportation.\n\nAnswer: No",
