This is an example of a conditional statement.\n\nFrom statement 2, we are told that the muffins might not have been blueberry. This means there is a possibility that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer from these two statements that \"the cake was not chocolate.\" The possibility that the muffins were not blueberry does not necessarily mean that the cake was not chocolate. It is possible that the cake was chocolate, but the muffins were a different flavor.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
