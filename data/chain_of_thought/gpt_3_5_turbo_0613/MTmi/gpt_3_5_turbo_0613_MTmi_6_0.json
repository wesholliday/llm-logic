It implies that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob's choice must be pasta.\n\n2. \"Bob might not have chosen pasta.\"\n   This statement suggests that there is a possibility that Bob did not choose pasta. It does not provide any information about what Bob actually chose.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\n- There is a possibility that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nFrom this information, we cannot definitively infer whether Sue chose pizza or not. It is still possible that Sue chose pizza, and Bob did not choose pasta. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Sue did not choose pizza' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
