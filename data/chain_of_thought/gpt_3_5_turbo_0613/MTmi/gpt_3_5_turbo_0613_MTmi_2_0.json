This is a conditional statement.\n\nFrom statement 2, we are told that the unicorn might not have been in the forest. This means there is a possibility that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Can we infer 'The griffin was not in the forest'?\"\n\nBased on the information given, we cannot directly infer that the griffin was not in the forest. The first statement only tells us that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest. It does not provide any information about the griffin's location if the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
