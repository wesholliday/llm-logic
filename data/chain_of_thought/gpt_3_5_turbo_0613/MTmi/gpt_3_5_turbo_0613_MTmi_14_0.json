This statement establishes a conditional relationship between the bear being in the cave and the wolf being in the den.\n\nStatement 2 introduces the possibility that the wolf might not have been in the den. This statement does not provide any information about the bear's location.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot directly infer that the bear was not in the cave. The possibility remains that the bear could have been in the cave, and the wolf might not have been in the den.\n\nAnswer: No",
