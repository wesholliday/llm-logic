            "content": "To answer this question, let's break down the given statements and analyze the logical implications:\n\n1. \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\"\n   This statement establishes a conditional relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana. It states that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\n\n2. \"The banana might not have been yellow.\"\n   This statement introduces uncertainty about the color of the banana. It suggests that the banana may not necessarily be yellow.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of these statements:\n\n- If the apple was red (as stated in the first statement), then the banana must have been yellow (according to the conditional relationship).\n- However, the second statement introduces doubt about the banana being yellow.\n\nBased on this analysis, we cannot definitively infer the color of the apple. The second statement does not provide enough information to contradict the conditional relationship established in the first statement. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"The apple was not red\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
