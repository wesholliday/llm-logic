This statement establishes a conditional relationship between the alien visiting Mars and the robot visiting Jupiter.\n\nStatement 2 introduces the possibility that the robot might not have visited Jupiter. This statement contradicts the condition established in statement 1.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars, we need to consider the possibility that the robot did not visit Jupiter. If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the condition in statement 1 is not satisfied, and we cannot conclude anything about the alien visiting Mars.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: No",
