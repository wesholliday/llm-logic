This is an implication where the antecedent is \"the shirt was cotton\" and the consequent is \"the pants were denim.\"\n\nFrom statement 2, we are given that the pants might not have been denim. This means that there is a possibility that the pants were not denim.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of these statements together. If the pants were not denim, it means that the consequent of statement 1 is false. In other words, if the pants were not denim, it does not necessarily mean that the shirt was not cotton. It is possible that the shirt was still cotton, but the pants were not denim.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the shirt was not cotton based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
