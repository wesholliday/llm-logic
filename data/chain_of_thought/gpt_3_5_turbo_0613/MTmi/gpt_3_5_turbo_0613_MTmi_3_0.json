This statement establishes a conditional relationship between James being the author and the book being a mystery novel.\n\nStatement 2 introduces the possibility that the book might not be a mystery novel. This statement contradicts the conclusion of statement 1, which states that if James is the author, the book must be a mystery novel.\n\nBased on these statements, we can infer that the book was not written by James. The reason is that if the book were written by James, it would have to be a mystery novel according to statement 1. However, statement 2 suggests that the book might not be a mystery novel, which contradicts the condition set in statement 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
