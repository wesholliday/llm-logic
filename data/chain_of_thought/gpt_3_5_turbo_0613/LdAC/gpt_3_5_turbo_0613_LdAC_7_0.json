It states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This does not provide any information about whether Alex actually finished the race or not.\n\nThe second statement, \"Chris finished the race,\" tells us that Chris indeed finished the race.\n\nBased on these two statements alone, we cannot logically deduce whether Alex finished the race or not. The first statement only establishes a relationship between Alex and Chris, but it does not provide any direct information about Alex's participation or completion of the race.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
