It establishes a relationship between the car being red and the truck being blue. It does not provide any information about the truck being blue or the car being red independently.\n\nThe second statement, \"The truck was blue,\" provides information about the truck's color. However, it does not provide any direct information about the car's color.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot logically deduce that the car was red. The first statement only establishes a relationship between the car being red and the truck being blue, but it does not provide any information about the car's color independently. The second statement only provides information about the truck's color, not the car's color.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
