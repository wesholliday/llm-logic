            "content": "To determine if we can logically deduce that the vampire was awake, we need to analyze the given statements. \n\nThe first statement is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\" In this case, A represents the vampire being awake, and B represents the mummy being awake. \n\nThe second statement is \"The mummy was awake.\" This statement tells us that B is true, meaning the mummy was indeed awake. \n\nTo deduce whether the vampire was awake, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. If the first statement is true and the second statement is true, then we can conclude that the vampire was awake. This is because the first statement establishes a cause-and-effect relationship between the vampire being awake and the mummy being awake. If the cause (vampire being awake) is true, and the effect (mummy being awake) is also true, then we can infer that the cause (vampire being awake) must be true as well. \n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can logically deduce that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
