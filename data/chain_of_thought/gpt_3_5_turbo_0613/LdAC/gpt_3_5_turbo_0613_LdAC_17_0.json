However, it does not tell us anything about what happens when Ben does not eat pasta. \n\nThe second statement tells us that Kate ate salad, but it does not provide any information about Ben's actions. \n\nBased on this analysis, we cannot logically deduce that Ben ate pasta from the given statements. \n\nAnswer: No",
