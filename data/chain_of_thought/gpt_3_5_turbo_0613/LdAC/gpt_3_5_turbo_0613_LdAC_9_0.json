It suggests that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. \n\nThe second statement, \"Mark bought the blue shirt,\" is a standalone statement that provides information about Mark's purchase. \n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. However, we cannot definitively determine whether Lisa actually bought the red shirt or not. It is possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, and Mark bought the blue shirt for some other reason. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
