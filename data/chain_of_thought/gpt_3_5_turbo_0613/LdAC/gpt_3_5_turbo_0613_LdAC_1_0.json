It states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This does not necessarily mean that Mary was at the wedding, but it establishes a relationship between Mary and Sue's presence.\n\nThe second statement directly states that Sue was at the wedding. This provides information about Sue's presence but does not provide any direct information about Mary's presence.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot logically deduce whether Mary was at the wedding or not. The first statement only establishes a relationship between Mary and Sue's presence, but it does not provide any information about Mary's actual presence. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Mary was at the wedding based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
