It states that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. \n\nThe second statement, \"The truck was metal,\" provides information about the truck's material. \n\nTo deduce that the doll was plastic, we need to consider the logical implications of these statements. \n\nIf the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal, according to the first statement. \n\nHowever, the second statement tells us that the truck is indeed metal. \n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the doll must be plastic. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
