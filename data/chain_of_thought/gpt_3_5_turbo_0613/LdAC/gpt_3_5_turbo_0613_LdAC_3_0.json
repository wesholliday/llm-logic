If the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel.\n2. The book is a mystery novel.\n\nHowever, we cannot conclude that the book was written by James solely based on these statements. The first statement establishes a conditional relationship, stating that if James wrote the book, then it is a mystery novel. However, it does not provide any information about who actually wrote the book. The second statement only confirms that the book is a mystery novel, but it does not provide any information about the author.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce that the book was written by James based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
