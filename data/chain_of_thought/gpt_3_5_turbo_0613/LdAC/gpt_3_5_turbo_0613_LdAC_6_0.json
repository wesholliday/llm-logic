It states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. This does not provide any information about what happens if Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nThe second statement, \"Bob chose pasta,\" tells us that Bob indeed chose pasta. \n\nBased on this information alone, we cannot definitively conclude whether Sue chose pizza or not. The first statement only provides a condition, but it does not tell us what happens if that condition is not met. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce that Sue chose pizza.\n\nAnswer: No",
