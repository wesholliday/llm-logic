It states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. This statement does not provide any information about what happens if the cake was not chocolate.\n\nThe second statement simply states that the muffins were blueberry.\n\nTo deduce whether the cake was chocolate, we need to consider the logical relationship between these statements. If the first statement is true and the second statement is true, then we can conclude that the cake was chocolate. However, if the first statement is true and the second statement is false, we cannot make any conclusions about the cake.\n\nTherefore, to determine if we can logically deduce \"The cake was chocolate,\" we need to know if the first statement is true and the second statement is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
