It establishes a relationship between the shirt being cotton and the pants being denim. It does not provide any information about the pants being denim or not.\n\nThe second statement, \"The pants were denim,\" tells us that the pants were indeed denim.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. However, we cannot determine whether the shirt was cotton or not solely based on the given information. There could be other possibilities for the shirt material that are not mentioned.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
