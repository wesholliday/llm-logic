This statement establishes a conditional relationship between the bear and the wolf.\n\nFrom Statement 2, we are given the information that the wolf was indeed in the den.\n\nTo deduce whether the bear was in the cave, we need to consider the logical implications of the conditional statement in Statement 1. If the antecedent (bear in the cave) is true, then the consequent (wolf in the den) must also be true. However, the conditional statement does not provide any information about what happens if the antecedent is false.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude whether the bear was in the cave or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
