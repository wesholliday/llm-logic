This is an example of a conditional statement.\n\nFrom Statement 2, we are given the information that the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that if the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was also in the forest. This is because Statement 1 establishes a logical connection between the presence of the griffin and the presence of the unicorn in the forest.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
