This implies a cause-and-effect relationship, suggesting that the package's shipment is a necessary condition for it to arrive today.\n\nHowever, the second statement introduces an additional condition, stating that the package was misrouted. This introduces a new factor that could potentially affect the package's arrival time. \n\nWithout any further information or logical reasoning, we cannot definitively infer that if the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today. The misrouting of the package could potentially cause delays or result in the package not arriving today.\n\nAnswer: No",
