This implies that a well-written essay is a sufficient condition for the student to receive an A. However, it does not provide any information about the impact of turning in the essay late.\n\nTo infer the second statement, we need to establish a logical connection between a well-written essay being turned in late and the student still receiving an A. However, the original statement does not provide any information about the impact of turning in the essay late on the student's grade.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer the statement \"If the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
