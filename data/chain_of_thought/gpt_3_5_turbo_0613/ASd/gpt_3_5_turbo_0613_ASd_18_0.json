However, the original statement only talks about the act of watering the plants and its effect on their growth. It does not provide any information about sunlight.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer that \"If I water the plants and there is no sunlight, they will grow\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
