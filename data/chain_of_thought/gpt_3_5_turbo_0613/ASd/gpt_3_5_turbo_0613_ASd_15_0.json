However, it does not explicitly mention the initial state of the battery. It could be assumed that the battery is not dead before charging, but it is not explicitly stated.\n\nThe inferred statement adds the condition that the battery is dead before charging. This condition is not mentioned in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot directly infer the inferred statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
