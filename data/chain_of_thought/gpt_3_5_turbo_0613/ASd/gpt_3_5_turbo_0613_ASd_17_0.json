This implies that changing the oil is a necessary condition for the car to run smoothly.\n\nIn the inferred statement, we are adding an additional condition, which is that the transmission is shot. However, the original statement does not mention anything about the condition of the transmission. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that changing the oil and having a shot transmission will result in the car running smoothly.\n\nAnswer: No",
