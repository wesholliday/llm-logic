However, the inferred statement introduces a new condition, which is the presence of a drought.\n\nTo determine if the inferred statement is valid, we need to consider whether a drought would have any impact on the lawn's lushness and greenness, regardless of whether it is fertilized or not. If a drought would prevent the lawn from being lush and green, then the inferred statement would be valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
