The statement \"Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked\" tells us that one of two possibilities must be true: either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked.\n\n2. The statement \"The sprocket is not daggled\" tells us that the sprocket is not daggled.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that if the sprocket is not daggled, then it must be cranked. This is because if one of the possibilities in the first statement is false (in this case, the sprocket is not daggled), then the other possibility must be true (the sprocket is cranked).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
