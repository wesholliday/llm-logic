It does not provide any information about which option is true.\n\n2. \"The glip is not tragged\" - This statement provides the information that the glip is not tragged.\n\nGiven these statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- The glip is not tragged.\n- The glip is either tragged or slogged.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively infer that \"The glip is slogged\" because the second statement does not provide any information about whether the glip is slogged or not. It only rules out the possibility of the glip being tragged.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: No.",
