It presents two mutually exclusive possibilities.\n\n2. \"The flob is not movated\" - This statement tells us that the flob is not movated. It eliminates one of the possibilities mentioned in the first statement.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that if the flob is not movated, it must be skizzled. This is because the first statement presents two exclusive options, and we have eliminated one of them with the second statement.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
