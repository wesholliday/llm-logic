The statement \"Either the grommet is plopped or it is sploffed\" tells us that one of two possibilities must be true: either the grommet is plopped or it is sploffed.\n\n2. The statement \"The grommet is not plopped\" tells us that the grommet is not in the state of being plopped.\n\n3. Since the grommet cannot be in the state of being plopped (as stated in step 2), and one of the two possibilities must be true (as stated in step 1), it follows that the grommet must be in the state of being sploffed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The grommet is sploffed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
