It does not provide any information about which option is true or false.\n\n2. \"The splat is not quanked\" - This statement provides the information that the splat is not quanked. It does not provide any information about whether the splat is morphed or not.\n\nGiven these statements, we cannot directly infer that \"The splat is morphed.\" The first statement only tells us that either the splat is quanked or it is morphed, but it does not provide any information about which option is true. The second statement tells us that the splat is not quanked, but it does not provide any information about whether the splat is morphed or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The splat is morphed\" from the given statements.",
