The statement \"Either the dreb is spened or it is vroombed\" tells us that one of two possibilities must be true: either the dreb is spened or it is vroombed.\n\n2. The statement \"The dreb is not spened\" tells us that the dreb is not spened.\n\n3. If the dreb is not spened, then the only possibility left from the first statement is that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can infer that \"The dreb is vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
