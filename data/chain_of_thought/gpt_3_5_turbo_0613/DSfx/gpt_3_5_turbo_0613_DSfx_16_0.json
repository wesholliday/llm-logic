The statement \"Either the sneg is sproted or it is crampled\" tells us that one of two possibilities must be true: either the sneg is sproted or it is crampled.\n\n2. The statement \"The sneg is not sproted\" tells us that the sneg is not sproted.\n\n3. If the sneg is not sproted, then the only remaining possibility from statement 1 is that the sneg is crampled.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can infer that \"The sneg is crampled\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
