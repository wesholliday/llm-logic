The statement \"Either the flugel is zargled or it is blimmed\" tells us that one of two possibilities must be true: either the flugel is zargled or it is blimmed.\n\n2. The statement \"The flugel is not zargled\" tells us that the flugel is not zargled. This means that the possibility of the flugel being zargled is eliminated.\n\n3. Since the possibility of the flugel being zargled is eliminated, the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can infer that \"The flugel is blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
