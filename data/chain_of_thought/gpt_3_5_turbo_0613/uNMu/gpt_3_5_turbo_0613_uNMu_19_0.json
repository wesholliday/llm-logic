In other words, there is a possibility that the watch is not charging on the dresser.\n\nThe negation of the statement would be \"It is the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\" This means that it is necessary for the watch to be charging on the dresser. In other words, there is no possibility that the watch is not charging on the dresser.\n\nSince the original statement allows for the possibility that the watch is not charging on the dresser, we can infer that the watch might not be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
