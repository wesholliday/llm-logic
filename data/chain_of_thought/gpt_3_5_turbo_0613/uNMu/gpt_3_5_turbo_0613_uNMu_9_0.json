This leaves open the possibility that Lisa did buy the red shirt, but it is not a requirement.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively infer that Lisa might not have bought the red shirt. It is still possible that she did buy it, but it is not a necessity. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
