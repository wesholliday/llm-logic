However, it does not necessarily mean that Alex definitely did not finish the race. \n\nIn other words, the statement allows for the possibility that Alex finished the race, but it also allows for the possibility that Alex did not finish the race. \n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we can infer that Alex might not have finished the race. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
