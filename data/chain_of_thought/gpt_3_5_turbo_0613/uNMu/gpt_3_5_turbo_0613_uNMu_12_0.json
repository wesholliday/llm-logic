The negation of this statement would be \"the jacket is not draped over the chair.\" \n\nSince the original statement is \"It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair,\" it aligns with the negation \"the jacket is not draped over the chair.\" \n\nTherefore, we can infer that the jacket might not be draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
