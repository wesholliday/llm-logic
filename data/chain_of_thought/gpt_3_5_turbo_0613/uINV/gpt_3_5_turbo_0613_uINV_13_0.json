It establishes a relationship between the color of the car and the color of the truck. It states that if the car is red, then the truck is blue.\n\nTo determine if the inverse of this statement is true, we need to negate both the antecedent (if the car was red) and the consequent (then the truck was blue). The inverse of the statement would be \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\"\n\nHowever, we cannot infer that the inverse is true based solely on the given statement. The original statement does not provide any information about what happens if the car is not red. It only establishes a relationship between the car being red and the truck being blue. Therefore, we cannot conclude that if the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\n\nAnswer: No",
