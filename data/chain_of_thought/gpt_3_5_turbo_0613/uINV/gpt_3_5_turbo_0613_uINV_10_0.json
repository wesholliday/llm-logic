This statement implies that whenever the dog is inside, the cat is always outside.\n\n2. Can we infer that if the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside? To determine this, we need to consider the possibility that the cat could be outside even if the dog is not inside. \n\nFor example, it is possible that the cat could be outside regardless of whether the dog is inside or not. In this case, the absence of the dog being inside does not necessarily mean that the cat is not outside.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that if the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside.\n\nAnswer: No",
