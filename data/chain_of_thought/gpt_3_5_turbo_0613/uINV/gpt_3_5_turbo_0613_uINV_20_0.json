It suggests that whenever the apple is red, the banana is yellow.\n\nHowever, the statement does not provide any information about what happens when the apple is not red. It is possible that the banana could still be yellow even if the apple is not red. For example, the banana could be yellow regardless of the color of the apple.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement alone, we cannot infer that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\n\nAnswer: No",
