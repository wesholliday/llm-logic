This means that whenever the vampire is awake, the mummy is also awake. We can represent this statement as: Vampire awake -> Mummy awake.\n\n2. Now, we need to determine if we can infer the opposite statement: If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake. This would mean that whenever the vampire is not awake, the mummy is also not awake. We can represent this statement as: Vampire not awake -> Mummy not awake.\n\nTo determine if we can infer this statement, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. In this case, the original statement does not provide any information about what happens when the vampire is not awake. It only tells us what happens when the vampire is awake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\n\nAnswer: No",
