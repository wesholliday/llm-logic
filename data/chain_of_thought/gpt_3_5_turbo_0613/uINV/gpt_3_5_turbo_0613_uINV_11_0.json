This statement implies that whenever the cake is chocolate, the muffins will always be blueberry.\n\n2. Now, let's consider the opposite scenario: if the cake was not chocolate. This means that the cake could be any flavor other than chocolate.\n\n3. Based on the given statement, we can infer that if the cake is not chocolate, then the muffins will not be blueberry. This is because the initial statement establishes a direct relationship between the cake being chocolate and the muffins being blueberry. So, if the cake is not chocolate, it means that the condition for the muffins being blueberry is not met.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
