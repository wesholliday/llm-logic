This statement implies that Chris's finishing the race is dependent on Alex's finishing the race. In other words, if Alex finishes, then Chris must also finish.\n\n2. If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race. This statement is the opposite of the first statement. It suggests that if Alex does not finish, then Chris also does not finish.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can infer that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race. This is because the second statement is the negation of the first statement, and the negation of a true statement is always false.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
