This statement establishes a conditional relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo.\n\n2. If Joe did not go to the park, it means the condition in the first statement is not met. However, this does not necessarily mean that Lucy did not go to the zoo. There could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo, unrelated to Joe going to the park.\n\n3. The first statement only tells us what happens if Joe goes to the park, but it does not provide any information about what happens if Joe does not go to the park. Therefore, we cannot make a direct inference about Lucy going to the zoo based on Joe not going to the park.\n\nAnswer: No",
