This statement implies that whenever Sue chooses pizza, Bob always chooses pasta. \n\n2. If Sue did not choose pizza, it means that she chose something other than pizza. However, we don't have any information about what Bob chooses when Sue doesn't choose pizza. It is possible that Bob still chooses pasta, or he could choose something else entirely.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot infer that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta. The statement only provides information about their choices when Sue chooses pizza, but it does not provide any information about their choices when Sue does not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: No",
