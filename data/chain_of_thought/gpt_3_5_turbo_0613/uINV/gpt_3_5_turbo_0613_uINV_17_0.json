In other words, if Ben ate pasta, it guarantees that Kate ate salad. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad based solely on the given statement. There could be other reasons why Kate ate salad, even if Ben did not eat pasta.",
