However, we cannot directly infer the opposite. Just because the shirt was not cotton does not necessarily mean that the pants were not denim.\n\nIt is possible that the pants could still be denim even if the shirt was not cotton. The statement only provides information about the relationship between the shirt and the pants when the shirt is cotton. It does not provide any information about the relationship between the shirt and the pants when the shirt is not cotton.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\n\nAnswer: No",
