This statement establishes a conditional relationship between the bear being in the cave and the wolf being in the den.\n\n2. If the bear was not in the cave, then we cannot directly infer anything about the wolf being in the den. The absence of the bear in the cave does not provide any information about the wolf's location.\n\nBased on this analysis, we cannot infer that if the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.\n\nAnswer: No",
