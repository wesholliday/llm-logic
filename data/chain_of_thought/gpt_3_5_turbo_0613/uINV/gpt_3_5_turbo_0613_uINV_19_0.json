If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n\nThis statement implies that if Tom watched football, it guarantees that Jen watched basketball. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if Tom did not watch football.\n\nTherefore, we cannot directly infer that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball. The absence of Tom watching football does not necessarily mean that Jen did not watch basketball. There could be other reasons why Jen watched basketball, even if Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: No",
