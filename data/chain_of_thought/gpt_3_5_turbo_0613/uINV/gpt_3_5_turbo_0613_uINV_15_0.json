However, it does not say anything about what happens if Sam did not take a plane.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train. It is possible that Erin still took a train even if Sam did not take a plane. There could be other reasons why Erin took a train, unrelated to Sam's mode of transportation.\n\nAnswer: No",
