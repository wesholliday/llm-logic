            "content": "To answer this question, let's break down the given statement:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nThis statement implies a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. It suggests that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark definitely bought the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's consider the second part of the question:\n\n2. Can we infer that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt?\n\nTo answer this, we need to examine the logical relationship between the two parts of the conditional statement. In a conditional statement, the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of the given statement would be:\n\nIf Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nSo, if we assume that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, according to the contrapositive, it would mean that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
