This statement establishes a conditional relationship between the presence of the griffin and the presence of the unicorn in the forest.\n\n2. If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest. This statement is the negation of the first statement and suggests that the absence of the griffin implies the absence of the unicorn in the forest.\n\nBased on these statements, we can infer that if the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
