If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nFrom this statement, we can infer that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. However, we cannot make any conclusions about the truck if the doll is not plastic. It is possible that the truck could still be metal even if the doll is not plastic.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\n\nAnswer: No",
