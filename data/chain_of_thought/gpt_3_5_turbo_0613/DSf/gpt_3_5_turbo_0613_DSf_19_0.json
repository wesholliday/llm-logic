The watch isn't on his wrist.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the watch is either on his wrist or charging on the dresser. \n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the watch is not on his wrist.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that the watch must be charging on the dresser. \n\nReasoning: If the watch is not on his wrist, and it can only be either on his wrist or charging on the dresser, then the only possibility left is that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
