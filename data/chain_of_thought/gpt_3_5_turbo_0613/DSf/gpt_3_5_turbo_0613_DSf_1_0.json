It eliminates the possibility of Fido being in the garden but does not provide any information about Fido's location inside.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot directly infer that \"Fido is inside.\" The first statement allows for the possibility that Fido could be inside, but it does not confirm it. We need additional information to make a definite inference about Fido's location.\n\nAnswer: No",
