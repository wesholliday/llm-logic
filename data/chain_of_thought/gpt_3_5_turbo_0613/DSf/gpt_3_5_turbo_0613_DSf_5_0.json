It implies that the cookies must be in one of these two locations.\n\nStatement 2: \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry.\"\nThis statement tells us that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry. It eliminates one possibility mentioned in Statement 1.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that the cookies must be in the jar. Since the cookies are not hidden in the pantry (as stated in Statement 2), the only remaining possibility from Statement 1 is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
