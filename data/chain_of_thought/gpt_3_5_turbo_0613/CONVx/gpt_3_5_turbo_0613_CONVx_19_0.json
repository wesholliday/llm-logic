This would result in:\n\nQ \u2192 P\n\nNow, let's consider the logical relationship between the original statement and the inferred statement. If P \u2192 Q is true, it means that whenever P is true, Q must also be true. However, this does not necessarily mean that whenever Q is true, P must also be true. The original statement does not provide any information about what happens when Q is true but P is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was vreebled\" from \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
