This is known as the converse of the original statement. However, the converse of a conditional statement is not always true.\n\nIn this case, we cannot directly infer the converse statement because the original statement does not provide any information about what happens when the wug is garpled. It only tells us what happens when the wug is sproinged.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
