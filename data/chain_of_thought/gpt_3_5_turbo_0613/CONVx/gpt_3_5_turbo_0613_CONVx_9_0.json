This can be done by applying the contrapositive rule, which states that if a conditional statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nThe contrapositive of \"Plinked -> Varnished\" is:\n\nNot Varnished -> Not Plinked\n\nTherefore, the statement \"If the twonk was varnished, then it was plinked\" can be inferred from \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
