This would result in:\n\nQ \u2192 P\n\nNow, let's consider if this inference is valid. In general, reversing the direction of an implication is not always valid. However, in this specific case, we can infer the reversed statement because the original statement is a logically valid implication.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
