In this case, P represents \"the fribble was snurgled\" and Q represents \"the fribble crinked\".\n\nTo infer the converse of a conditional statement, we switch the positions of P and Q. So, the converse of the original statement would be 'If the fribble crinked, then the fribble was snurgled'.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the converse of a conditional statement is not always true. In this case, we cannot automatically assume that if the fribble crinked, then it was snurgled. The original statement only tells us that if the fribble was snurgled, then it crinked. It does not provide any information about what happens if the fribble crinked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the fribble crinked, then the fribble was snurgled' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
