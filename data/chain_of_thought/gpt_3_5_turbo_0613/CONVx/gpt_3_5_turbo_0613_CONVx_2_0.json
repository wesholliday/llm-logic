So, the reverse statement would be: \"If B, then A.\"\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the reverse statement may not always be true. In this case, we cannot directly infer the reverse statement because the original statement does not provide any information about what happens if the wug bimmed the zoint.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
