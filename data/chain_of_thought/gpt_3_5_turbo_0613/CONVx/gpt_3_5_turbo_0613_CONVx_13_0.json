This is known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of the original statement is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, it would be \"If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged.\"\n\nTherefore, we cannot directly infer 'If the glip was tragged, then the glip was slogged' from the original statement. The contrapositive statement is different from the original statement, and we cannot assume that it holds true without further information.\n\nAnswer: No",
