            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden. This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the options must be true.\n\nThe second premise negates the possibility that Fido must be in the garden. This means that Fido is not required to be in the garden.\n\nFrom these premises, we can conclude that Fido must be inside. This conclusion follows logically because if Fido is not required to be in the garden and the only other option is that Fido is inside, then it logically follows that Fido must be inside.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
