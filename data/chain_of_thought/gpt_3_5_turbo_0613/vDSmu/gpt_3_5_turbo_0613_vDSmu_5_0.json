            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry. This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the options must be true.\n\nThe second premise negates the possibility that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry. This means that it is not the case that the cookies are required to be in the pantry.\n\nFrom these premises, we can conclude that the cookies are in the jar. This is because if it is not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry, and the only other option is that they are in the jar, then the conclusion logically follows.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
