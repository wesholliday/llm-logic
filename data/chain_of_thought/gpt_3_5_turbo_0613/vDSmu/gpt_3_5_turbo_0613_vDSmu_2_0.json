            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table. This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two options must be true.\n\nThe second premise states that it is not the case that the book must be resting on the table. This means that the option of the book resting on the table is false.\n\nFrom these premises, we can conclude that the book must be on the shelf. This is because if one option (resting on the table) is false, then the other option (on the shelf) must be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
