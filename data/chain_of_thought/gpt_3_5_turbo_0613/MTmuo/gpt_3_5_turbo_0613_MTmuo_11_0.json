It implies that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If the muffins were blueberry, it does not necessarily mean that the cake was chocolate. The first statement allows for the possibility that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\n- If the cake was not chocolate, we cannot definitively determine the flavor of the muffins. The second statement only provides information about the muffins if the cake was chocolate.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The cake was not chocolate\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
