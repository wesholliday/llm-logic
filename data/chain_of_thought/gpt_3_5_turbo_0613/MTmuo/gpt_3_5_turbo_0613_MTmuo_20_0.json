            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"The apple was not red\" from the given statements, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow\" - This statement tells us that it is not necessary for the banana to be yellow.\n\n2. \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" - This statement establishes a conditional relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana. It states that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If the banana must have been yellow, then the apple cannot be red. This is because the second statement establishes a direct relationship between the colors of the apple and the banana. If the banana is not yellow, then the condition of the second statement is not met, and we cannot determine the color of the apple.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The apple was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
