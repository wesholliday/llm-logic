If the car is red, then the truck must be blue.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If the truck is not required to be blue, it means that the truck can be of any color, including blue.\n- If the car being red implies that the truck must be blue, and the truck can be blue, then it is possible for the car to be red.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The car was not red\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
