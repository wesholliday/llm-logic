In other words, Sue's presence at the wedding is not guaranteed.\n\n2. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\"\n   This statement establishes a conditional relationship between Mary and Sue. It states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there as well.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If Sue must have been at the wedding, then Mary must have been at the wedding (using the contrapositive of statement 2).\n- However, it is not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding (statement 1).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer whether Mary was at the wedding or not based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
