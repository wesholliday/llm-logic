            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"The shirt was not cotton\" from the given statements, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\"\n   This statement tells us that the pants are not necessarily denim. It means that the pants could be made of a material other than denim.\n\n2. \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\"\n   This statement establishes a conditional relationship between the shirt and the pants. It states that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of these statements:\n\n- If the pants are not necessarily denim (as stated in the first statement), it means that they could be made of a material other than denim.\n\n- If the shirt is cotton (as stated in the second statement), then the pants must be denim.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that if the pants are not necessarily denim and the pants must be denim if the shirt is cotton, then it is not possible for the shirt to be cotton. This is because if the shirt were cotton, it would contradict the first statement that the pants are not necessarily denim.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
