It implies that if Tom watched football, then it is necessary for Jen to have watched basketball.\n\nBased on these statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n- But it's not necessary for Jen to have watched basketball.\n\nFrom this reasoning, we can conclude that it is not possible for Tom to have watched football. Therefore, we can infer that \"Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
