            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"The doll was not plastic\" from the given statements, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\"\n   This statement tells us that the truck does not necessarily have to be made of metal. It means that the truck could be made of a material other than metal.\n\n2. \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\"\n   This statement establishes a conditional relationship between the doll and the truck. It states that if the doll is made of plastic, then the truck must be made of metal.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If the truck is not required to be made of metal (as stated in the first statement), then it is possible for the truck to be made of a material other than metal.\n- If the doll is made of plastic (as stated in the second statement), then the truck must be made of metal.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively infer whether the doll was plastic or not based on the given information. The statements do not provide any direct information about the doll's material. It is possible for the doll to be made of plastic or another material.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: no, we cannot infer \"The doll was not plastic\" from the given statements.",
