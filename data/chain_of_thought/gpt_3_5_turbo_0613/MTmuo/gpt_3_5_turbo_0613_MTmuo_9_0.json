            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" from the given statements, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\"\n   This statement tells us that it is not necessary for Mark to have bought the blue shirt. In other words, Mark may or may not have bought the blue shirt.\n\n2. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\"\n   This statement establishes a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. It states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then it is necessary for Mark to have bought the blue shirt.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If Mark did not buy the blue shirt (as stated in the first statement), then the conditional relationship in the second statement is not applicable. In this case, Lisa buying the red shirt does not imply anything about Mark's purchase.\n\n- If Mark did buy the blue shirt (contrary to the first statement), then the conditional relationship in the second statement applies. In this case, if Lisa bought the red shirt, it would mean that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not based on the given statements. The information provided is not sufficient to make a conclusive determination.\n\nAnswer: No",
