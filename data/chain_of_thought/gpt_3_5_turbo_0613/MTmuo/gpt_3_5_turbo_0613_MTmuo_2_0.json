It implies that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn must also be in the forest.\n\nBased on these statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If the unicorn must have been in the forest, then it is necessary for the griffin to be in the forest as well (according to the second statement).\n- However, the first statement tells us that it is not necessary for the unicorn to be in the forest.\n- Therefore, we can conclude that it is not necessary for the griffin to be in the forest.\n\nNow, let's answer the question:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
