In other words, it is possible that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\n2. \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\"\n   This statement establishes a conditional relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo. It states that if Joe went to the park, then it is necessary for Lucy to have gone to the zoo.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n- It is not necessary for Lucy to have gone to the zoo.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude whether Joe went to the park or not. The given information does not provide any direct information about Joe's actions.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"Joe did not go to the park\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
