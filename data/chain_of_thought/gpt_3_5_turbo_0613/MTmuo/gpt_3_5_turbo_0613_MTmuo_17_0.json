In other words, it is possible that Kate did not eat salad.\n\n2. \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\"\n   This statement establishes a conditional relationship between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating salad. It states that if Ben ate pasta, then it is necessary for Kate to have eaten salad.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If Kate did not eat salad (as stated in the first statement), then it means that Ben did not eat pasta (according to the second statement). This is because if Ben had eaten pasta, it would be necessary for Kate to have eaten salad.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"Ben did not eat pasta\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
