It implies that if the alien visited Mars, then it is necessary for the robot to have visited Jupiter.\n\nBased on these statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If the robot did not have to visit Jupiter (statement 1), then it is possible that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n- If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the conditional relationship in statement 2 is not violated.\n- Therefore, it is possible that the alien visited Mars without the robot visiting Jupiter.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The alien did not visit Mars\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
