It means that the book could be a different genre.\n\n2. \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\"\n   This statement establishes a conditional relationship. It states that if James is the author, then the book must be a mystery novel.\n\nBased on these statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If the book is a mystery novel, then it must have been written by James. (Contrapositive of statement 2)\n- If the book is not a mystery novel, then it may or may not have been written by James. (Negation of statement 2)\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The book was not written by James\" because the first statement tells us that the book could be a different genre. It is possible that the book is not a mystery novel but still written by James.\n\nAnswer: No",
