It states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\n\nBased on these statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If the mummy must have been awake, then it is necessary for the vampire to have been awake as well (according to the second statement).\n- However, the first statement tells us that it is not necessary for the mummy to have been awake.\n\nFrom this reasoning, we can conclude that it is not necessary for the vampire to have been awake. However, we cannot definitively infer that the vampire was not awake. It is still possible for the vampire to have been awake, but it is not a requirement.\n\nAnswer: No",
