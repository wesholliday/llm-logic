The negation of \"the smonk was vreebled\" is \"the smonk was not vreebled,\" and the negation of \"the smonk plagged\" is \"the smonk did not plagged.\"\n\nTherefore, the inferred statement would be:\n\n\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\nwhere \u00acP represents \"the smonk was not vreebled\" and \u00acQ represents \"the smonk did not plagged.\"\n\nNow, we need to compare the original statement (P \u2192 Q) with the inferred statement (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP) to see if they are logically equivalent.\n\nBy comparing the truth tables of both statements, we can determine if they have the same truth values for all possible combinations of truth and falsity for P and Q.\n\nAfter constructing the truth tables, we find that the original statement (P \u2192 Q) and the inferred statement (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP) have the same truth values for all possible combinations of truth and falsity for P and Q.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the smonk did not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled\" from \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
