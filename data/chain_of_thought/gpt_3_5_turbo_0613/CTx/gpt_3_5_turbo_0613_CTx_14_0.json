The negation of P is \"The clug was not fleeked,\" and the negation of Q is \"The clug did not snugged.\"\n\nThe inferred statement can be written as \"If not Q, then not P\" or \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nNow, we need to compare the original statement P \u2192 Q with the inferred statement \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nTherefore, if we can infer \"If the clug did not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked\" from \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged,\" it means that the original statement and its contrapositive are equivalent.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
