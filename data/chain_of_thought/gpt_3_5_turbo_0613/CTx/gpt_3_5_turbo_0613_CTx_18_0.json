If the inferred statement is the contrapositive of the original statement, then they are logically equivalent.\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement is:\n\n\u00acNugged -> \u00acPlooked\n\nComparing the inferred statement 'If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked' with the contrapositive of the original statement, we can see that they are the same.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked' from 'If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
