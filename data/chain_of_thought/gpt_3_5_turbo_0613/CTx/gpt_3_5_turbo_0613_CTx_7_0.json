This would result in:\n\n\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\nWhere \u00acP represents \"the whiffle was not shanked\" and \u00acQ represents \"the whiffle did not tink.\"\n\nNow, we need to compare the original statement (P \u2192 Q) with the inferred statement (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP). If the inferred statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, then we can infer it.\n\nTo determine if the two statements are logically equivalent, we can use the contrapositive rule. The contrapositive of the original statement (P \u2192 Q) is:\n\n\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\nSince the inferred statement (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP) is the same as the contrapositive of the original statement, we can infer \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked\" from \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
