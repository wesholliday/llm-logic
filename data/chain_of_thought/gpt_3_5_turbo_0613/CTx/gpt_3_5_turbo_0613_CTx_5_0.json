The negation of P is \"the zinger was not fraggled,\" and the negation of Q is \"the zinger was not smoogled.\" Therefore, the inferred statement can be represented as:\n\n\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\nNow, we need to compare the original statement (P \u2192 Q) with the inferred statement (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP). If they have the same logical form, we can infer one from the other.\n\nIn this case, the original statement (P \u2192 Q) and the inferred statement (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP) have the same logical form, which is the form of a contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled\" from \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
