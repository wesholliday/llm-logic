The negation of P is \"the wug was not flooped,\" and the negation of Q is \"the wug did not bim the zoint.\" Reversing the implication gives us:\n\n\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\nSo, the statement \"If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped\" can be represented as \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nNow, we need to compare the original statement (P \u2192 Q) with the inferred statement (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP) to see if they are logically equivalent.\n\nBy comparing the truth tables of P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, we can determine if they have the same truth values for all possible combinations of P and Q.\n\nTruth table for P \u2192 Q:\n\n| P | Q | P \u2192 Q |\n|---|---|-------|\n| T | T |   T   |\n| T | F |   F   |\n| F | T |   T   |\n| F | F |   T   |\n\nTruth table for \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP:\n\n| Q | P | \u00acQ | \u00acP | \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP |\n|---|---|----|----|--------|\n| T | T | F  | F  |   T    |\n| T | F | F  | T  |   T    |\n| F | T | T  | F  |   F    |\n| F | F | T  | T  |   T    |\n\nBy comparing the truth tables, we can see that P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP do not have the same truth values for all possible combinations of P and Q. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped\" from \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
