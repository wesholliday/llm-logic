Negating \"If the twonk was plinked\" gives us \"If the twonk was not plinked,\" and negating \"then it was varnished\" gives us \"then it was not varnished.\" So the inferred statement would be:\n\nNot Varnished -> Not Plinked\n\nNow, we need to compare the inferred statement with the original statement to see if they are logically equivalent. If the inferred statement is true whenever the original statement is true, and vice versa, then we can infer it.\n\nIn this case, the inferred statement \"Not Varnished -> Not Plinked\" is not logically equivalent to the original statement \"Plinked -> Varnished.\" The original statement allows for the possibility that the twonk was not plinked, but it doesn't tell us anything about whether it was varnished or not. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
