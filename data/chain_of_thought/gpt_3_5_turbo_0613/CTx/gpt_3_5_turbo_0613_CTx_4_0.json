This would result in:\n\n\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\nwhere \u00acP represents \"the fribble was not snurgled\" and \u00acQ represents \"the fribble did not crink.\"\n\nNow, we need to compare the original statement (P \u2192 Q) with the inferred statement (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP) to see if they are logically equivalent.\n\nIn this case, the original statement states that if the fribble was snurgled (P), then the fribble crinked (Q). The inferred statement states that if the fribble did not crink (\u00acQ), then the fribble was not snurgled (\u00acP).\n\nBased on the logical relationship between the two statements, we can conclude that:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
