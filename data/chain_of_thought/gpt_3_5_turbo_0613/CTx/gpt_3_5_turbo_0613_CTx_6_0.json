It implies that if the grommet was sploffed, then it definitely plopped the frink.\n\nNow, let's analyze the proposed inference:\n\n2. \"If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\"\n   - This statement suggests a conditional relationship between not plopping the frink and not being sploffed. It implies that if the grommet did not plop the frink, then it definitely was not sploffed.\n\nTo determine if the inference is valid, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. The original statement does not provide any information about what happens if the grommet was not sploffed. It only establishes a relationship between being sploffed and plopping the frink.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
