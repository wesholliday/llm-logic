This would result in:\n\n\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\nwhere \u00acP represents \"the flugel was not blimmed\" and \u00acQ represents \"the flugel was not zargled.\"\n\nNow, we need to compare the original statement (P \u2192 Q) with the inferred statement (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP). If the inferred statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, then we can infer it.\n\nTo determine if the two statements are logically equivalent, we can use the contrapositive rule. The contrapositive of the original statement (P \u2192 Q) is:\n\n\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\nwhich is the same as the inferred statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed\" from \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
