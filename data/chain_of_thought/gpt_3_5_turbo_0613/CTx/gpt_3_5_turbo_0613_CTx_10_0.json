The negation of P is \"the wug was not sproinged,\" and the negation of Q is \"the wug was not garpled.\" Reversing the implication gives us:\n\n\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\nSo, the statement \"If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged\" can be represented as \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nNow, we need to compare the original statement (P \u2192 Q) with the inferred statement (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP). If the inferred statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, then we can infer it.\n\nTo check if the two statements are logically equivalent, we can use a truth table:\n\n| P | Q | \u00acQ | \u00acP | P \u2192 Q | \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP |\n|---|---|----|----|-------|---------|\n| T | T |  F |  F |   T   |    T    |\n| T | F |  T |  F |   F   |    T    |\n| F | T |  F |  T |   T   |    F    |\n| F | F |  T |  T |   T   |    T    |\n\nBy comparing the truth values of the original statement (P \u2192 Q) and the inferred statement (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP), we can see that they are not equivalent. In the third row of the truth table, the original statement is true (T), but the inferred statement is false (F).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged\" from \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
