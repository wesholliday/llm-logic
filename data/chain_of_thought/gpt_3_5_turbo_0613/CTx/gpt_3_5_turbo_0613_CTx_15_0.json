This is because if Q is true, then \u00acQ is false, and if P is true, then \u00acP is false. In this case, the inferred statement holds.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the original statement is false, i.e., P is true and Q is false, then the inferred statement (\u00acQ -> \u00acP) is not necessarily true. This is because if Q is false, then \u00acQ is true, but P can still be true or false. In this case, the inferred statement does not hold.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\" from the given statement \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
