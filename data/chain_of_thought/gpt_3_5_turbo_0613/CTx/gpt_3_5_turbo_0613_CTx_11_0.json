This would result in:\n\n\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\nwhere \u00acP represents \"the flug was not blummed\" and \u00acQ represents \"the flug was not zimmed\".\n\nNow, let's compare the original statement (P \u2192 Q) with the inferred statement (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP). If they have the same logical structure, then we can infer one from the other.\n\nIn this case, the inferred statement (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP) is the contrapositive of the original statement (P \u2192 Q). The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed\" from \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
