The negation of \"Morphed -> Quanked\" is \"Morphed and not Quanked.\"\n\nTherefore, the inferred statement would be \"Morphed and not Quanked -> Not Morphed.\"\n\nNow, let's compare the inferred statement with the original statement:\n\nOriginal statement: Morphed -> Quanked\nInferred statement: Morphed and not Quanked -> Not Morphed\n\nThe inferred statement is not the same as the original statement. In the original statement, we only know that if the splat was morphed, then it quanked. However, we cannot conclude that if the splat did not quank, then it was not morphed. There could be other reasons why the splat did not quank even if it was morphed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'no.' We cannot infer \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed\" from \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\"",
