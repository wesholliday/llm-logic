It does not provide any specific information about the location of the missing piece.\n\nStatement 2: \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor.\"\nThis statement presents two possibilities for the location of the missing puzzle piece: either it is in the box or it is blending in on the floor. It does not exclude the possibility of the missing piece being in the box.\n\nBased on these statements, we cannot definitively infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box. The second statement allows for the possibility that the missing piece could be on the floor. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
