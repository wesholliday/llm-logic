It implies that the umbrella cannot be in both places simultaneously.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- The umbrella might not be in the closet, which means it could be somewhere else.\n- The only other option mentioned is that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
