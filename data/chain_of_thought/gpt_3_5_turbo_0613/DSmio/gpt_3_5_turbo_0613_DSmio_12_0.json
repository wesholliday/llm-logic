It implies that one of these two options must be true.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that if the jacket is not hanging in the closet (as suggested in Statement 1), then it must be draped over the chair (as stated in Statement 2). This inference is valid because Statement 2 presents the only alternative to the jacket being in the closet.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Yes.",
