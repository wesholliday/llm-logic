It implies that the notebook must be in one of these two locations.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the notebook cannot be sitting on the nightstand. However, we cannot definitively infer that the notebook is in the drawer. It is still possible that the notebook is in another location not mentioned in the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
