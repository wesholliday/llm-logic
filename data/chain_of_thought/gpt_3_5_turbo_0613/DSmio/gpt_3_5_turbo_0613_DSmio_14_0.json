It does not provide any information about where the milk actually is.\n\nStatement 2: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\"\nThis statement presents two possibilities: either the milk is on the counter or it is chilling in the fridge. It implies that the milk must be in one of these two locations, but it does not provide any specific information about which one is true.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot definitively infer that the milk is on the counter. The possibility remains that the milk could be chilling in the fridge. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
