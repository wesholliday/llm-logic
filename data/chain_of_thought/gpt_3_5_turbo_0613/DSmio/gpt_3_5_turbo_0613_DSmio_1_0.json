It does not provide any information about where Fido might be.\n\n2. \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\": This statement presents two possibilities: either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden. It implies that Fido cannot be both inside and in the garden simultaneously.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that \"Fido is inside.\" The statements only provide possibilities and do not provide enough evidence to determine Fido's exact location.\n\nAnswer: No",
