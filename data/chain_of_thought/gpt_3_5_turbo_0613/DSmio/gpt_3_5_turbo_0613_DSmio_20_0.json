It does not provide any information about where the sunglasses might be.\n\nStatement 2: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\"\nThis statement presents two possibilities: either the sunglasses are in her bag or they are on her head. It implies that these are the only two options.\n\nBased on these statements, we cannot definitively infer that the sunglasses are in her bag. While it is one of the possibilities mentioned in Statement 2, Statement 1 indicates that the sunglasses might not be on her head at all. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: No",
