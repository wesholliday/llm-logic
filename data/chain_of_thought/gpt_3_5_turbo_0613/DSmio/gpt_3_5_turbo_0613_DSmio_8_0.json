It does not provide any information about where the remote control might be.\n\nStatement 2: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\nThis statement presents two possibilities: either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is under the couch. It does not exclude the possibility of the remote control being on the coffee table.\n\nBased on these statements, we cannot definitively infer that the remote control is on the coffee table. The first statement only suggests that it might not be under the couch, and the second statement presents two possibilities without providing any additional information.\n\nAnswer: No",
