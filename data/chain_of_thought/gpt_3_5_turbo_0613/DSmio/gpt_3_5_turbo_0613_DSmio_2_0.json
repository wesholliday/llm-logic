It does not provide any information about where the book might be.\n\nStatement 2: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\nThis statement presents two possibilities: either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table. It does not exclude any other possibilities.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that there is a possibility that the book is on the shelf, but we cannot definitively infer that it is on the shelf. The book could still be resting on the table.\n\nAnswer: No",
