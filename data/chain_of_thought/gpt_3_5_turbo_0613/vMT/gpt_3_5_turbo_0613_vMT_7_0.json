            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nThe first premise states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This can be represented as: \nP1: Alex finished the race \u2192 Chris finished the race\n\nThe second premise states that Chris did not finish the race. This can be represented as: \nP2: \u00acChris finished the race\n\nThe conclusion is that Alex did not finish the race. This can be represented as: \nC: \u00acAlex finished the race\n\nTo evaluate the logical validity, we can use a method called modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that states if we have a conditional statement (if-then) and the consequent (the part after the \"then\") is false, then we can conclude that the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is also false.\n\nIn this case, the argument can be represented as:\nP1: If A, then C\nP2: \u00acC\nC: \u00acA\n\nBy applying modus tollens, we can see that if Chris did not finish the race (\u00acC), then we can conclude that Alex did not finish the race (\u00acA). Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
