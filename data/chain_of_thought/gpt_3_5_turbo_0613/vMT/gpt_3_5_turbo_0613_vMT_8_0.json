            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nThe first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This can be represented as: \nVampire awake \u2192 Mummy awake\n\nThe second premise states that the mummy was not awake. This can be represented as: \n\u00acMummy awake\n\nTo reach the conclusion that the vampire was not awake, we need to use the rule of inference called modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (if A then B) and the consequent (B) is false, then we can conclude that the antecedent (A) is also false. \n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is: \nVampire awake \u2192 Mummy awake\n\nThe consequent is: \n\u00acMummy awake\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can conclude: \n\u00acVampire awake\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid if the premises are true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
