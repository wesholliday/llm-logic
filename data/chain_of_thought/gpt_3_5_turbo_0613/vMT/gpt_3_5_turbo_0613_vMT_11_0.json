            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument can be represented symbolically as follows:\nP1: If A, then B\nP2: Not B\nC: Not A\n\nTo evaluate the validity, we can use a method called modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, then we can conclude that A must also be false.\n\nIn this case, the first premise states \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" (If A, then B). The second premise states \"The muffins were not blueberry\" (Not B). \n\nUsing modus tollens, we can conclude that \"The cake was not chocolate\" (Not A).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
