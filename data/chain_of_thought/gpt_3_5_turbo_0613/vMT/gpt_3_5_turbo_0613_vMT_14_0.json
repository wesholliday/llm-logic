            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument. \n\nThe first premise states that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. This can be represented as: \nP1: Bear in cave \u2192 Wolf in den\n\nThe second premise states that the wolf was not in the den. This can be represented as: \nP2: \u00ac(Wolf in den)\n\nThe conclusion states that the bear was not in the cave. This can be represented as: \nC: \u00ac(Bear in cave)\n\nTo evaluate the logical validity, we can use a method called modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that states if we have a conditional statement (if-then) and the consequent (the part after the 'then') is false, then we can conclude that the antecedent (the part before the 'then') is also false.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\" The consequent is \"The wolf was not in the den.\" According to modus tollens, if the consequent is false, we can conclude that the antecedent is also false.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure of the argument and the application of modus tollens, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
