            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\nPremise 1: If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\nPremise 2: The cat was not outside.\nConclusion: The dog was not inside.\n\nTo evaluate the validity, we can use a technique called modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, then we can conclude that A must also be false.\n\nIn this argument, the first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" The second premise states that \"The cat was not outside.\" According to modus tollens, if the cat was not outside (B is false), then we can conclude that the dog was not inside (A is false).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
