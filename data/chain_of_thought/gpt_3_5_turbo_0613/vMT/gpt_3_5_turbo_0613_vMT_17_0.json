            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nThe first premise states that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. This can be represented as: \nP1: Ben ate pasta \u2192 Kate ate salad\n\nThe second premise states that Kate did not eat salad. This can be represented as: \nP2: \u00ac(Kate ate salad)\n\nThe conclusion is that Ben did not eat pasta. This can be represented as: \nC: \u00ac(Ben ate pasta)\n\nTo evaluate the validity of the argument, we can use a method called modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that states if we have a conditional statement (if-then) and the consequent (the part after the 'then') is false, then we can conclude that the antecedent (the part before the 'then') is also false.\n\nIn this case, the argument can be represented as:\nP1: Ben ate pasta \u2192 Kate ate salad\nP2: \u00ac(Kate ate salad)\nC: \u00ac(Ben ate pasta)\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can see that if Kate did not eat salad (P2), then we can conclude that Ben did not eat pasta (C). This is because if the consequent of the conditional statement (Kate ate salad) is false, then the antecedent (Ben ate pasta) must also be false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
