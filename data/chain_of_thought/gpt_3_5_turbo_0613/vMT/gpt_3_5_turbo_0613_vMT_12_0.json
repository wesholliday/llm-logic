            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nThe first premise states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. This is a conditional statement, and we can represent it as \"P \u2192 Q\" (where P represents Joe going to the park and Q represents Lucy going to the zoo).\n\nThe second premise states that Lucy did not go to the zoo, which can be represented as \"\u00acQ\" (where \u00ac represents negation).\n\nThe conclusion is \"Joe did not go to the park,\" which can be represented as \"\u00acP\" (where \u00ac represents negation).\n\nTo determine if the conclusion follows logically from the premises, we can use a method called modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement \"P \u2192 Q\" and the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ), then we can infer the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP).\n\nIn this case, the first premise is a conditional statement (\"P \u2192 Q\"), and the second premise is the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ). Therefore, we can use modus tollens to infer the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP).\n\nBased on this analysis, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
