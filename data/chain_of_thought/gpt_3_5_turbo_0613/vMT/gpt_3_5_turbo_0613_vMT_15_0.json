            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nThe first premise states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. This can be represented as: \nP1: Sam took a plane \u2192 Erin took a train.\n\nThe second premise states that Erin did not take a train. This can be represented as: \nP2: \u00acErin took a train.\n\nThe conclusion is that Sam did not take a plane. This can be represented as: \nC: \u00acSam took a plane.\n\nTo evaluate the validity of the argument, we can use a method called modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that states if we have a conditional statement (if-then) and the consequent (the part after the 'then') is false, then we can conclude that the antecedent (the part before the 'then') is also false.\n\nIn this case, the argument follows the form of modus tollens. If Erin did not take a train (P2: \u00acErin took a train), which is the consequent of the conditional statement in the first premise, then we can conclude that Sam did not take a plane (C: \u00acSam took a plane), which is the antecedent of the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
