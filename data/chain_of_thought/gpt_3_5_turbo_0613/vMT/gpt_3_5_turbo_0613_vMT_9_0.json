            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nThe first premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This is a conditional statement, and we can represent it as: \"If P, then Q.\"\n\nThe second premise states that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. We can represent this as: \"Not Q.\"\n\nTo reach the conclusion that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, we need to show that it necessarily follows from the premises. In other words, we need to demonstrate that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo do this, we can use a method called modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that states if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know \"Not Q,\" then we can conclude \"Not P.\"\n\nIn this case, the first premise is in the form of \"If P, then Q,\" and the second premise is \"Not Q.\" Therefore, we can apply modus tollens to conclude \"Not P,\" which means Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
