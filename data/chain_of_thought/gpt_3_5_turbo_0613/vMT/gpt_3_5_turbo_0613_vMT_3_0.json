            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nThe first premise states that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. This can be represented as: \nP1: If A, then B\n\nThe second premise states that the book is not a mystery novel. This can be represented as: \nP2: Not B\n\nThe conclusion is that the book was not written by James. This can be represented as: \nC: Not A\n\nTo evaluate the logical validity, we can use a method called modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that states if we have a conditional statement (if A, then B) and the consequent (B) is false, then we can conclude that the antecedent (A) is also false.\n\nIn this case, the argument follows the form of modus tollens:\nP1: If A, then B\nP2: Not B\nC: Not A\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
