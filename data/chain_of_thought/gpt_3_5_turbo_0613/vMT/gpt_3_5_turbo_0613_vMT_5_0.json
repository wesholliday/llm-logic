This can be represented as: \nJeff played basketball \u2192 Amy played tennis.\n\nThe second premise states that Amy did not play tennis. This can be represented as: \n\u00acAmy played tennis.\n\nTo reach the conclusion that Jeff did not play basketball, we need to show that it necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nIf we assume that Jeff played basketball, then according to the first premise, Amy played tennis. However, the second premise states that Amy did not play tennis, which contradicts the assumption. \n\nIf we assume that Jeff did not play basketball, then the first premise does not provide any information about Amy playing tennis. The second premise does not contradict this assumption. \n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
