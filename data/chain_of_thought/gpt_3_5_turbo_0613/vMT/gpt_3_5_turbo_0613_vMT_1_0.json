            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nThe first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This can be represented as: \nP1: Mary at wedding \u2192 Sue at wedding\n\nThe second premise states that Sue was not at the wedding. This can be represented as: \nP2: \u00acSue at wedding\n\nThe conclusion is that Mary was not at the wedding. This can be represented as: \nC: \u00acMary at wedding\n\nTo evaluate the validity, we can use a proof by contradiction. \n\nAssume that Mary was at the wedding (Mary at wedding). According to the first premise, this would imply that Sue was at the wedding (Sue at wedding). However, the second premise states that Sue was not at the wedding (\u00acSue at wedding). This creates a contradiction, as we have both Sue at wedding and \u00acSue at wedding. \n\nSince assuming Mary at wedding leads to a contradiction, we can conclude that Mary was not at the wedding (\u00acMary at wedding). \n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
