            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. This can be represented as: P \u2192 Q, where P represents \"the doll was plastic\" and Q represents \"the truck was metal\".\n\nThe second premise states that the truck was not metal. This can be represented as: \u00acQ, where \u00acQ represents \"the truck was not metal\".\n\nThe conclusion states that the doll was not plastic. This can be represented as: \u00acP, where \u00acP represents \"the doll was not plastic\".\n\nTo determine if the conclusion follows logically from the premises, we can use a method called modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and the consequent (Q) is false (\u00acQ), then we can conclude that the antecedent (P) is also false (\u00acP).\n\nIn this case, the second premise (\u00acQ) matches the consequent of the first premise (Q). Therefore, we can conclude that the antecedent (P) of the first premise is false (\u00acP).\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
