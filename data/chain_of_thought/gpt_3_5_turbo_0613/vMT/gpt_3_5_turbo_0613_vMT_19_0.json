            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nThe first premise states that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This can be represented as: \nIf Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. \n\nThe second premise states that Jen did not watch basketball. This can be represented as: \nNot Jen watched basketball. \n\nFrom these premises, we can infer that it is not the case that Tom watched football. This can be represented as: \nNot Tom watched football. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion 'Tom did not watch football' logically follows from the given premises. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
