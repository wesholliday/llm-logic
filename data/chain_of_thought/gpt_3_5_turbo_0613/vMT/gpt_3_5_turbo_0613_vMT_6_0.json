            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the form of the argument. The argument can be represented symbolically as follows:\n\nP1: If P, then Q\nP2: Not Q\nC: Not P\n\nThis is a valid form of argument known as modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and the consequent (Q) is false, then we can conclude that the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\nIn this case, the first premise states \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" which can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P represents Sue choosing pizza and Q represents Bob choosing pasta. The second premise states \"Bob did not choose pasta\" which can be represented as \u00acQ. The conclusion is \"Sue did not choose pizza\" which can be represented as \u00acP.\n\nBy applying modus tollens, we can see that if Bob did not choose pasta (\u00acQ), then it follows that Sue did not choose pizza (\u00acP). Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
