It does not provide any information about the actual location of the cookies.\n\nStatement 2: \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\"\nThis statement suggests that there is a possibility that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry. It does not provide any information about the actual location of the cookies either.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that there is a possibility that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, but we still do not have any information about their location.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the cookies are in the jar based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
