This is because the word \"either\" implies that one of the two options must be true.\n\nFrom statement 2, we are told that the watch might not be on his wrist. This means that one of the options mentioned in statement 1 (charging on the dresser or on his wrist) is not true.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser. This is because if the watch were on his wrist, it would contradict statement 2, which says that the watch might not be on his wrist.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
