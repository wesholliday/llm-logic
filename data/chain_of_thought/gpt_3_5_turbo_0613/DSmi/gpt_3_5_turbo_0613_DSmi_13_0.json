This means that these are the only two possible locations for the toy.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf. This means that one of the possible locations for the toy is eliminated.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the toy must be in the toy box because it is the only remaining possible location.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
