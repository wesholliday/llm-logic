This is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the options must be true.\n\nStatement 2 introduces uncertainty by stating that the sunglasses might not be perched on her head. This means that one of the options mentioned in Statement 1 (perched on her head) is not guaranteed.\n\nHowever, this uncertainty does not provide enough information to conclude that the sunglasses are in her bag. It is still possible that the sunglasses are on her head, even though it is not guaranteed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: No",
