It cannot be both places simultaneously.\n\nFrom Statement 2, we are told that the scarf might not be on the coat rack. This means that one possibility is that the scarf is not on the coat rack.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that the scarf is either in the backpack or not on the coat rack. However, we cannot definitively determine whether the scarf is stuffed in the backpack based on the given information. It is still possible that the scarf is not in the backpack but also not on the coat rack.\n\nAnswer: No",
