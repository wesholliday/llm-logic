It cannot be both at the same time.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that there is a possibility that the milk is not chilling in the fridge. This means that one of the options mentioned in statement 1 is eliminated, namely the option of the milk being in the fridge.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
