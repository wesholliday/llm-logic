This is because the word \"either\" implies that one of the two options must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that there is a possibility that the newspaper is not on the porch. However, it does not provide any information about the newspaper's location.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot definitively infer that the newspaper is in the driveway. While it is a possibility, there is not enough evidence to support this conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No",
