The statement 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' suggests that Fido is either inside or in the garden. This is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the options must be true.\n\n2. The statement 'Fido might not be in the garden' indicates that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. This introduces doubt about Fido's location.\n\n3. Combining the two statements, we have two possibilities: \n   a) Fido is inside and not in the garden.\n   b) Fido is in the garden.\n\n4. However, since the second statement introduces doubt about Fido being in the garden, we cannot definitively conclude that Fido is in the garden.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer 'Fido is inside' with certainty.\n\nAnswer: No",
