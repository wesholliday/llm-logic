However, if the cat is playing in the bedroom, we cannot determine where it is napping.\n\nStatement 2 states that the cat might not be playing in the bedroom. This means that there is a possibility that the cat is not playing in the bedroom, but it does not provide any information about where the cat might be.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot definitively infer that the cat is napping on the couch. \n\nAnswer: No",
