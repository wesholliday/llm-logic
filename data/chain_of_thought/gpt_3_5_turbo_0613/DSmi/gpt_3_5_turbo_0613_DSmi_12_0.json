This means that one of these two options must be true.\n\nStatement 2 introduces the possibility that the jacket might not be hanging in the closet. This means that the second option mentioned in Statement 1 (the jacket hanging in the closet) is not necessarily true.\n\nHowever, this does not provide enough information to conclude that the jacket is draped over the chair. It is still possible that the jacket is neither draped over the chair nor hanging in the closet.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: No",
