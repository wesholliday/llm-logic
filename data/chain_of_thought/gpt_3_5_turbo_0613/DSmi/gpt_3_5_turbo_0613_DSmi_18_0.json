It does not provide any specific information about the notebook's location.\n\nStatement 2 states that the notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand. This means that the possibility of the notebook being on the nightstand is not certain.\n\nBased on these statements alone, we cannot definitively infer that the notebook is in the drawer. The information provided does not exclude the possibility of the notebook being on the nightstand or any other location.\n\nAnswer: No",
