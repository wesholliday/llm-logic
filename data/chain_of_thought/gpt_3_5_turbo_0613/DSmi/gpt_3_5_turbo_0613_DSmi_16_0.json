This is because the statement presents two mutually exclusive options.\n\nFrom Statement 2, we are told that the pen might not be on my desk. This means that there is a possibility that the pen is not on the desk.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that if the pen is not on the desk (as stated in Statement 2), then it must be in my bag (as stated in Statement 1). However, we cannot definitively conclude that the pen is in my bag because there is still a possibility that it could be on the desk.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
