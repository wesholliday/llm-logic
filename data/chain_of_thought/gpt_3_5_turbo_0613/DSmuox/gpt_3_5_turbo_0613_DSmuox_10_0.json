This means that it could be either sproinged or not garpled.\n\nStatement 2 presents two possibilities: either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled. Since we know from statement 1 that the wug is not necessarily garpled, it leaves us with the possibility that the wug is sproinged.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The wug is sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
