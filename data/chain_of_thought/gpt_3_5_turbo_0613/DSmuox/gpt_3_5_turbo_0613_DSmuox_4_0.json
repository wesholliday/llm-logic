This means that the fribble can be either crinked or not crinked.\n\nStatement 2 presents two possibilities: either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked. Since we know from statement 1 that it is not necessary for the fribble to be crinked, the only remaining possibility is that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The fribble is snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
