This means that there is a possibility that the smip is not lupped.\n\nStatement 2 presents two possibilities: either the smip is shripped or it must be lupped. Since we know from statement 1 that it is not necessary for the smip to be lupped, the only remaining possibility is that the smip is shripped.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The smip is shripped.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
