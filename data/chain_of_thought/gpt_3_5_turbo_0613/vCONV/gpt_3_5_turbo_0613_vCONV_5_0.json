            "content": "To determine if this form of argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument. \n\nThe premise states: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be represented as: J -> A (If J, then A).\n\nThe conclusion states: \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball.\" This can be represented as: A -> J (If A, then J).\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In this case, we can use the law of contrapositive, which states that if a conditional statement (p -> q) is true, then its contrapositive (~q -> ~p) is also true.\n\nApplying the law of contrapositive to the premise (J -> A), we get: ~A -> ~J (If not A, then not J).\n\nComparing the conclusion (A -> J) with the contrapositive of the premise (~A -> ~J), we can see that they have the same logical structure. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
