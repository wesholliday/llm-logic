            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the form of the argument. The argument follows a conditional statement: \"If A, then B.\" The premise states \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow,\" and the conclusion states \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\"\n\nIn a conditional statement, the antecedent (A) is the part that comes after \"if,\" and the consequent (B) is the part that comes after \"then.\" In this case, the antecedent is \"the apple was red,\" and the consequent is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\nTo evaluate the validity of the argument, we can use the principle of transposition. Transposition allows us to switch the antecedent and the consequent in a conditional statement while maintaining logical equivalence. According to transposition, if \"If A, then B\" is true, then \"If not B, then not A\" is also true.\n\nApplying transposition to the premise, we get \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\" However, this is not the same as the conclusion, which states \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\"\n\nSince the premise and the conclusion are not logically equivalent, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
