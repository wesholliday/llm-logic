            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the form of the argument. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\nPremise: If A, then B\nConclusion: If B, then A\n\nThis argument follows the form of a valid logical inference known as the contrapositive. In a contrapositive, the premise is switched and negated, and the conclusion is also switched and negated. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\".\n\nIn this case, the premise \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" can be rewritten as \"If not denim, then not cotton\". Similarly, the conclusion \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton\" can be rewritten as \"If not cotton, then not denim\".\n\nBy comparing the contrapositive of the premise with the conclusion, we can see that they have the same form. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
