            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the form of the argument. The argument follows a conditional statement: \"If A, then B.\" The premise states \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" The conclusion states \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race.\"\n\nTo evaluate the validity of the argument, we can use a technique called the Law of Contrapositive. According to this law, if a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is true, then its contrapositive \"If not B, then not A\" is also true.\n\nIn this case, the premise \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" can be rewritten as the contrapositive \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\" Similarly, the conclusion \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race\" can be rewritten as the contrapositive \"If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race.\"\n\nSince the premise and conclusion are both contrapositives of each other, and the Law of Contrapositive states that if a conditional statement and its contrapositive are true, then the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
