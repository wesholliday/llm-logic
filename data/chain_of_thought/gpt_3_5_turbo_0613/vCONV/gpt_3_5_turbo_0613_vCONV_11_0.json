            "content": "To determine if this form of argument is logically valid, we can analyze it using the principle of logical implication. \n\nThe premise states \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This can be represented as: \nP1: Cake is chocolate -> Muffins are blueberry\n\nThe conclusion states \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate.\" This can be represented as: \nC1: Muffins are blueberry -> Cake is chocolate\n\nTo evaluate the logical validity, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In other words, we need to determine if the conclusion can be derived from the premise using valid logical reasoning.\n\nIn this case, the argument follows the form of a valid logical implication known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nThe contrapositive of the premise \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is: \nP1': If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\n\nComparing the contrapositive of the premise (P1') with the conclusion (C1), we can see that they have the same structure and meaning. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premise, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
