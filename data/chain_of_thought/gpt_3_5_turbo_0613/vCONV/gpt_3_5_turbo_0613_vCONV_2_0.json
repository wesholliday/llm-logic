            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the form of the argument. The argument follows a conditional statement: \"If A, then B.\" The premise states \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" The conclusion states \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was in the forest.\"\n\nTo evaluate the validity of the argument, we can use a technique called the Law of Contrapositive. According to the Law of Contrapositive, if a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is true, then its contrapositive \"If not B, then not A\" is also true.\n\nIn this case, the premise \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" can be rewritten as \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\" This is the contrapositive of the premise.\n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive of the premise with the conclusion: \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\" (contrapositive of the premise) versus \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was in the forest\" (the conclusion).\n\nSince the contrapositive of the premise matches the conclusion, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
