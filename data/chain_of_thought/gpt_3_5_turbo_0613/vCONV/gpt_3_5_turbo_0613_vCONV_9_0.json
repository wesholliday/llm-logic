            "content": "To determine if this form of argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if it follows a valid logical form.\n\nThe argument can be represented as follows:\n\nPremise: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\nConclusion: If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nThis argument follows the form of a logical implication, where the premise is a conditional statement and the conclusion is also a conditional statement. In this case, the premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. The conclusion states that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. In other words, we need to see if the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premise.\n\nIn this case, the argument is valid because it follows the logical form of a contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. In this argument, the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, which means that if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
