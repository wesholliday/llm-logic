The argument can be represented as follows:\n\nPremise: If A, then B\nConclusion: If B, then A\n\nThis argument follows the form of a valid logical inference known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of an implication is logically equivalent to the original implication. In other words, if the premise \"If A, then B\" is true, then the conclusion \"If B, then A\" must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
