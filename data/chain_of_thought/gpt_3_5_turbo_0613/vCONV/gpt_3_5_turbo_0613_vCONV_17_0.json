The argument can be represented symbolically as follows:\n\nPremise: If P, then Q\nConclusion: If Q, then P\n\nThis argument follows the form of a valid logical inference known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of an implication states that if the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false. In other words, if Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\nIn this case, the argument is in the form of the contrapositive, where the premise is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" and the conclusion is \"If Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta.\" The contrapositive form is logically valid, meaning that if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
