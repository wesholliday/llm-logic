Contraposition is a valid logical inference that states that if a conditional statement is true (if A then B), then its contrapositive is also true (if not B then not A).\n\nIn this case, the premise \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" can be rewritten as its contrapositive \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\" Similarly, the conclusion \"If the truck was blue, then the car was red\" can be rewritten as its contrapositive \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\"\n\nSince the argument follows the form of a valid logical inference (contraposition), we can conclude that this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
