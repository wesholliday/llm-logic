            "content": "To determine if this form of argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument. \n\nThe argument can be represented as follows:\n\nPremise: If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\nConclusion: If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside.\n\nTo evaluate the validity of this argument, we can use a technique called the method of logical inference. In this case, we can use a valid form of inference called contraposition.\n\nContraposition is a valid inference that states that if a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is true, then the contrapositive \"If not B, then not A\" is also true.\n\nIn the given argument, the premise \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" can be rewritten in the contrapositive form as \"If the cat was inside, then the dog was outside.\"\n\nNow, let's compare the conclusion \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside\" with the contrapositive of the premise \"If the cat was inside, then the dog was outside.\"\n\nThe conclusion and the contrapositive have the same logical structure, which means that if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
