            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form. The argument follows a conditional statement: \"If A, then B.\" The premise states \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" The conclusion states \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake.\"\n\nTo evaluate the validity of the argument, we can use the principle of contraposition. According to contraposition, if a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is true, then its contrapositive \"If not B, then not A\" is also true.\n\nIn this case, the premise \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" can be rewritten as \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake\" using contraposition.\n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive of the premise with the conclusion: \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake\" (contrapositive of the premise) versus \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake\" (the conclusion).\n\nThe contrapositive of the premise does not match the conclusion. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
