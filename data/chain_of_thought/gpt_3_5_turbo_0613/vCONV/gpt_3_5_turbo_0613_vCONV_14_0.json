            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the form of the argument. The argument can be represented symbolically as follows:\n\nPremise: If P, then Q\nConclusion: If Q, then P\n\nThis is a form of argument known as the contrapositive. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. It is formed by negating both the antecedent and the consequent, and then switching their positions.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of the premise 'If the bear was in the case, then the wolf was in the den' would be 'If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the case'. \n\nThe conclusion 'If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case' matches the contrapositive of the premise. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
