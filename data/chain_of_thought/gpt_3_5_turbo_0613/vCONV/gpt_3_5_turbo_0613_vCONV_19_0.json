            "content": "To determine if this form of argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument. \n\nThe premise states: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This can be represented as: \nP1: Tom watched football \u2192 Jen watched basketball.\n\nThe conclusion states: \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football.\" This can be represented as: \nC1: Jen watched basketball \u2192 Tom watched football.\n\nTo evaluate the logical validity, we can use a technique called the Law of Contrapositive. According to this law, if a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) is true, then its contrapositive (~Q \u2192 ~P) is also true.\n\nIn this case, the premise (P1) can be rewritten in its contrapositive form as: \nP1': ~Jen watched basketball \u2192 ~Tom watched football.\n\nComparing the conclusion (C1) with the contrapositive of the premise (P1'), we can see that they have the same logical structure. Both statements follow the form of a conditional statement, where the antecedent (~Jen watched basketball) implies the consequent (~Tom watched football).\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure of the argument and the Law of Contrapositive, we can conclude that this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
