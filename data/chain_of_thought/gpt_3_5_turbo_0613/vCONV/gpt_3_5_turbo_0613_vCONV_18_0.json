            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the form of the argument. The argument follows a conditional statement: \"If A, then B.\" The premise states \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" The conclusion states \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic.\"\n\nTo evaluate the validity of the argument, we can use the principle of contraposition. According to the principle of contraposition, if a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is true, then its contrapositive \"If not B, then not A\" is also true.\n\nIn this case, the premise \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" can be rewritten as \"If not metal, then not plastic.\" Similarly, the conclusion \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic\" can be rewritten as \"If not plastic, then not metal.\"\n\nBy applying the principle of contraposition, we can see that the premise and conclusion are equivalent. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
