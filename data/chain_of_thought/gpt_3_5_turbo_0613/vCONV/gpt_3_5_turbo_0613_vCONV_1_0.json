            "content": "To determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise states that \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be represented as: Mary at wedding \u2192 Sue at wedding.\n\nThe conclusion states that \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\" This can be represented as: Sue at wedding \u2192 Mary at wedding.\n\nTo evaluate the logical validity, we can use a technique called the Law of Contrapositive. According to this law, if a conditional statement (p \u2192 q) is true, then its contrapositive (~q \u2192 ~p) is also true.\n\nIn this case, the premise can be rewritten in its contrapositive form as: ~Sue at wedding \u2192 ~Mary at wedding.\n\nComparing the contrapositive of the premise (~Sue at wedding \u2192 ~Mary at wedding) with the conclusion (Sue at wedding \u2192 Mary at wedding), we can see that they have the same structure. Both statements follow the form of a conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the Law of Contrapositive, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
