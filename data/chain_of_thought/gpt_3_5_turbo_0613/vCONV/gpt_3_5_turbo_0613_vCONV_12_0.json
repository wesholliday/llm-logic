In other words, we need to check if the premise implies the conclusion.\n\nIf we assume that Joe went to the park (Joe \u2192 Lucy), can we logically conclude that Lucy went to the zoo (Lucy \u2192 Joe)? Yes, this is a valid implication.\n\nIf Joe went to the park, it implies that Lucy went to the zoo. And if Lucy went to the zoo, it implies that Joe went to the park. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
