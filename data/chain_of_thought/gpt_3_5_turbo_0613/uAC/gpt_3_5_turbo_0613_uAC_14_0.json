The wolf was in the den.\n\nBased on the first statement, if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. Since the second statement tells us that the wolf was indeed in the den, we can conclude that the first part of the conditional statement is true.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer from this information that the bear was in the cave. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if the bear is in the cave, but it does not provide any information about what happens if the bear is not in the cave.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that the bear was in the cave based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
