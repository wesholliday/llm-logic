The banana was yellow.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. However, statement 2 tells us that the banana was indeed yellow. \n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the apple could have been red, but we cannot definitively infer that the apple was red. There could be other possibilities, such as the apple being a different color or the statement about the apple and banana being unrelated.\n\nAnswer: No",
