Chris finished the race.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This means that Chris finishing the race is a necessary condition for Alex finishing the race. \n\nThe second statement tells us that Chris finished the race. \n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer from these two statements that Alex finished the race. It is possible that Chris finished the race, but Alex did not. The first statement only establishes a one-way relationship, stating that if Alex finished, then Chris finished, but it does not provide any information about what happens if Chris finishes.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: No",
