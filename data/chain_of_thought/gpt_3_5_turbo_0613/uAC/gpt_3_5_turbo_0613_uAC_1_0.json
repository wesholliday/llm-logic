Sue was at the wedding.\n\nBased on the first statement, if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. The second statement tells us that Sue was indeed at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer that Mary was at the wedding?\n\nSince the first statement establishes a conditional relationship between Mary and Sue, we can infer that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary must have been at the wedding as well. This is because the first statement states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. Since Sue was at the wedding, it logically follows that Mary must have been there too.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
