However, we cannot definitively infer whether Sam took a plane or not. The first statement only establishes a conditional relationship between Sam taking a plane and Erin taking a train. It does not provide any information about whether Sam actually took a plane or not. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Sam took a plane based on the given information. \n\nAnswer: No",
