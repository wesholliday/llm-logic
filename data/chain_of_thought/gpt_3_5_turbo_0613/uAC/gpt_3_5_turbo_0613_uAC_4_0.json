The robot visited Jupiter.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can conclude that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. However, this does not necessarily mean that the alien actually visited Mars. It only establishes a conditional relationship between the alien visiting Mars and the robot visiting Jupiter.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the robot did visit Jupiter. This information does not provide any direct evidence about whether the alien visited Mars or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the alien visited Mars. \n\nAnswer: No",
