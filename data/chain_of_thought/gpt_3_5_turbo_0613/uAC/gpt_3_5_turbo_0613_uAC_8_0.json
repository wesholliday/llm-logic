The mummy was awake.\n\nBased on the first statement, if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was also awake. So, if the mummy is awake (as stated in the second statement), it implies that the vampire must also be awake. This is because the first statement establishes a conditional relationship between the vampire and the mummy's wakefulness.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
