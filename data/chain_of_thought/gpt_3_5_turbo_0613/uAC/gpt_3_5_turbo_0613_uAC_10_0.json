The cat was outside.\n\nBased on the first statement, if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. This means that if the dog was not inside, we cannot conclude anything about the cat's location. However, if the dog was inside, then we can infer that the cat was outside.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the cat was indeed outside. This aligns with the condition mentioned in the first statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the dog was inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
