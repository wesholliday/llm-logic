If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n2. Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can conclude that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. However, this does not necessarily mean that Lisa actually bought the red shirt. It only establishes a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt.\n\nThe second statement tells us that Mark bought the blue shirt. This information is independent of the first statement and does not provide any direct information about Lisa's purchase.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
