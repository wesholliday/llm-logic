This means that if Tom did watch football, it guarantees that Jen watched basketball. \n\nThe second statement confirms that Jen watched basketball. \n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that Jen watched basketball, but we cannot definitively infer whether Tom watched football or not. It is possible that Tom watched football, as it would satisfy the condition in the first statement. However, it is also possible that Tom did not watch football, as there could be other reasons why Jen watched basketball. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
