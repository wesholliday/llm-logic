The truck was blue.\n\nBased on the first statement, if the car was red, then the truck was blue.

In this case, both the car and the truck are the specified colors.\n2. If the car was not red, then the truck could be any color. In this case, the truck could still be blue, but the car could be a different color.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that the car was red based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
