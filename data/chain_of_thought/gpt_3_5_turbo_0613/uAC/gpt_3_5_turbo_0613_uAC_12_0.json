Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nBased on the first statement, if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. The second statement tells us that Lucy did go to the zoo. \n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer that Joe went to the park. The first statement only establishes a conditional relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo. It does not provide any information about what actually happened to Joe.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Joe went to the park based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
