The second premise states that it might not be under the bed. \n\nIf we assume that the first premise is true, and the missing sock is indeed either in the laundry basket or under the bed, and we also assume that the second premise is true, that it might not be under the bed, then we can conclude that the missing sock must be in the laundry basket. This is because if it is not under the bed, and the only other option is the laundry basket, then it must be in the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
