The pants were not denim.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. However, statement 2 tells us that the pants were not denim. \n\nIf the pants were not denim, it means that the condition in statement 1 was not met. In other words, the antecedent of the conditional statement (the shirt being cotton) did not occur. \n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
