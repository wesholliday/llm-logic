The robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. However, statement 2 tells us that the robot did not visit Jupiter. \n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively conclude whether the alien visited Mars or not. The robot not visiting Jupiter does not provide any information about the alien's visit to Mars. Therefore, we cannot infer that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: No",
