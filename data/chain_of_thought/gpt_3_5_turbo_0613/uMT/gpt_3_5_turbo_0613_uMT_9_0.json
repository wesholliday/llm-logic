Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nFrom statement 2, we can conclude that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. Therefore, the first part of statement 1 (If Lisa bought the red shirt) is false because it implies that Mark bought the blue shirt. Since the first part of statement 1 is false, we cannot make any inferences about Lisa buying the red shirt based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
