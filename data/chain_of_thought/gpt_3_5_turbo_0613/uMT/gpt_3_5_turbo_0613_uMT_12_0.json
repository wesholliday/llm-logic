Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Joe went to the park, Lucy went to the zoo. However, statement 2 tells us that Lucy did not go to the zoo. \n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively infer whether Joe went to the park or not. It is possible that Joe went to the park and Lucy did not go to the zoo for some other reason. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: No",
