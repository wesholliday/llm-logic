The mummy was not awake.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake. However, statement 2 tells us that the mummy is not awake. \n\nIf the mummy is not awake, it means that the condition in statement 1 is not satisfied. In other words, the vampire cannot be awake because if it were, the mummy would also be awake. \n\nTherefore, we can infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
