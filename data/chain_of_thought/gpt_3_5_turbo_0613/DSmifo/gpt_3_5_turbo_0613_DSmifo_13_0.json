It does not provide any information about where the toy might be.\n\nStatement 2: \"Either the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box.\"\nThis statement presents two possibilities: either the toy is on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box. It does not exclude any other locations for the toy.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that the toy is either on the bookshelf or in the toy box. However, we cannot definitively infer that the toy is specifically in the toy box. It is still possible that the toy is on the bookshelf.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
