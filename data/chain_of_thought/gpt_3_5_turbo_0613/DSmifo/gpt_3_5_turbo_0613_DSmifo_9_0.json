It leaves open the possibility that it could be somewhere else.\n\n2. \"Either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\"\n   This statement presents two possibilities: either the missing puzzle piece is on the floor and blending in, or it is in the box. It implies that these are the only two options.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that if the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor, then it must be in the box. However, we cannot definitively infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box without additional information.\n\nAnswer: No",
