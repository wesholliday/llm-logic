It does not provide any information about where the remote control might be.\n\nStatement 2: \"Either the remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table.\"\nThis statement presents two possibilities: either the remote control is under the couch or it is on the coffee table. It does not exclude any other locations.\n\nBased on these statements, we cannot definitively infer that the remote control is on the coffee table. While it is one of the possibilities mentioned in Statement 2, Statement 1 suggests that there is a chance the remote control is not under the couch at all. Therefore, we cannot make a conclusive inference about the remote control's location.\n\nAnswer: No",
