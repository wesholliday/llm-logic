It does not exclude any other options.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that there are two possibilities: the milk is either not in the fridge or it is on the counter. However, we cannot definitively infer that \"The milk is on the counter\" because there is still a possibility that it is not in the fridge.\n\nAnswer: No",
