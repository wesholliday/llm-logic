It does not provide any specific information about where the cookies might be.\n\nStatement 2: \"Either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar.\"\nThis statement presents two possibilities: either the cookies are in the pantry or they are in the jar. It does not exclude any other locations.\n\nCombining the two statements, we can conclude that the cookies are not necessarily in the pantry, but they could be in the jar. However, we cannot definitively infer that the cookies are in the jar because there is still a possibility that they are in another location not mentioned in the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
