It does not provide any information about where the sunglasses might be.\n\nStatement 2: \"Either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag.\"\nThis statement presents two possibilities: either the sunglasses are on her head or they are in her bag. It does not exclude any other locations for the sunglasses.\n\nCombining the two statements, we can conclude that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head and that they could be in her bag. However, we cannot definitively infer that the sunglasses are in her bag based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
