It does not exclude the possibility that the book is on the shelf.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot definitively infer that \"The book is on the shelf.\" The first statement allows for the possibility that the book is not on the table, but it does not provide any information about where the book might be. The second statement only presents two possibilities, but it does not provide any evidence to support one over the other.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
