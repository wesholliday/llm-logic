It does not provide any information about where the scarf might be.\n\nStatement 2: \"Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack.\"\nThis statement presents two possibilities: either the scarf is on the coat rack or it is in the backpack. It does not exclude any other options.\n\nBased on these statements, we cannot definitively infer that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack. While it is one of the possibilities mentioned in Statement 2, Statement 1 does not provide any additional information to confirm this inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
