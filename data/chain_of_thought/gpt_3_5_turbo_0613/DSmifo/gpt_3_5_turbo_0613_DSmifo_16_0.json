It does not provide any information about where the pen might be.\n\nStatement 2: \"Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag.\"\nThis statement presents two possibilities: either the pen is on the desk or it is in the bag. It does not exclude any other locations for the pen.\n\nCombining the two statements, we can conclude that there are two possibilities: either the pen is not on the desk and it is in the bag, or the pen is on the desk. However, we cannot definitively infer that the pen is in the bag based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
