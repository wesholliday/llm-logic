It does not provide any definitive information about Fido's location.\n\n2. \"Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside\": This statement presents two possibilities: either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside. It does not exclude the possibility that Fido is both in the garden and inside.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot definitively infer that \"Fido is inside.\" The statements only provide possibilities and do not provide enough information to make a conclusive determination about Fido's location.\n\nAnswer: No",
