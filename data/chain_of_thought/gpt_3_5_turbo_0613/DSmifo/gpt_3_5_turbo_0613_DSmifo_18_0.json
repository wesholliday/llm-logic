It does not provide any information about where the notebook might be.\n\n2. \"Either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer.\"\n   This statement presents two possibilities: either the notebook is on the nightstand or it is in the drawer. It does not exclude any other locations for the notebook.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot definitively infer that the notebook is in the drawer. While it is one of the possibilities mentioned, the statement does not provide enough evidence to conclude that the notebook is specifically in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: No",
