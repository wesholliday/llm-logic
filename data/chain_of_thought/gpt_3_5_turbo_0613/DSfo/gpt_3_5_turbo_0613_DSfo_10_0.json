It does not provide any information about where the missing sock is.\n\nStatement 2: \"Either the missing sock is under the bed or it's in the laundry basket.\"\nThis statement presents two possibilities: either the missing sock is under the bed or it's in the laundry basket. It does not exclude any other possibilities.\n\nCombining the two statements, we know that the missing sock is not under the bed, but we cannot definitively conclude that it is in the laundry basket. It could still be somewhere else.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
