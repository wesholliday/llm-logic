It does not exclude the possibility that the watch is not on his wrist and also not charging on the dresser.\n\nBased on these statements alone, we cannot definitively infer that the watch is charging on the dresser. The second statement allows for the possibility that the watch is not on his wrist and not charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: No",
