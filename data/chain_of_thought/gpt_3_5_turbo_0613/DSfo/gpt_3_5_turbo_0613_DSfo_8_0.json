It does not provide any information about where the remote control is located.\n\nStatement 2: \"Either the remote control is hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table.\"\nThis statement presents two possibilities: either the remote control is under the couch or it is on the coffee table. It does not exclude any other locations.\n\nCombining the two statements, we know that the remote control is not under the couch, but we do not have any direct information about its location. The second statement only provides two possibilities, but it does not confirm which one is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: No",
