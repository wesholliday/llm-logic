It implies that the puzzle piece is somewhere other than the floor.\n\nStatement 2: \"Either the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\"\nThis statement presents two possibilities: either the missing puzzle piece is on the floor or it is in the box. It does not exclude any other possibilities.\n\nCombining the two statements, we can conclude that the missing puzzle piece is not on the floor. However, we cannot definitively infer that it is in the box because there may be other locations where the puzzle piece could be.\n\nAnswer: No",
