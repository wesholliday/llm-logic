It does not provide any information about where the cat is.\n\nStatement 2: \"Either the cat is playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch.\"\nThis statement presents two possibilities: either the cat is playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch. It does not exclude any other possibilities.\n\nCombining the two statements, we know that the cat is not playing in the bedroom, but we don't have any direct information about where it is. The second statement only provides two possibilities, but it doesn't confirm which one is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: No",
