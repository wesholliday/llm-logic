This means that whenever the doll is plastic, the truck is always metal. \n\nWe are also given that 'The truck was metal' is true. This means that the truck is indeed made of metal. \n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. Since we know that the truck is metal, it is possible that the doll is plastic. However, we do not have enough information to definitively say that the doll is plastic. \n\nTherefore, the statement 'The doll was plastic' cannot be determined to be true based on the given information. \n\nAnswer: No",
