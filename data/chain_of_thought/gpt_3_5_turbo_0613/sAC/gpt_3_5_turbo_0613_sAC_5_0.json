According to the conditional statement, if the antecedent (p) is true, then the consequent (q) must also be true. \n\nSince 'Amy played tennis' is true, it satisfies the condition for the consequent (q) of the conditional statement. Therefore, it follows that the antecedent (p) must also be true. \n\nHence, the answer is: yes.",
