It states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. \n\nThe statement \"Sue was at the wedding\" is a simple statement that asserts Sue's presence at the wedding. \n\nGiven that the conditional statement is true and the statement \"Sue was at the wedding\" is also true, we can conclude that Mary being at the wedding is a possibility. However, we cannot definitively conclude that Mary was at the wedding based on the given information. \n\nAnswer: No",
