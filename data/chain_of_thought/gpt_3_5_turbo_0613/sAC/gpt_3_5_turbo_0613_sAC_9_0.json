It only establishes a relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt.\n\n2. \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" - This statement tells us that Mark did indeed buy the blue shirt. It does not provide any information about Lisa's purchase.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not. The statement \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is not necessarily true just because Mark bought the blue shirt. There could be other factors or conditions that determine Lisa's purchase. \n\nAnswer: No",
