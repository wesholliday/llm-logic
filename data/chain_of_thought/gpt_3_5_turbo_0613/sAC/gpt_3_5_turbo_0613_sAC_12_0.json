This means that whenever A is true (Joe went to the park), B must also be true (Lucy went to the zoo). \n\nWe are also given that \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is true. \n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that it is possible for both A and B to be true. However, we cannot definitively say that Joe went to the park because there could be other scenarios where Lucy went to the zoo without Joe going to the park. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
