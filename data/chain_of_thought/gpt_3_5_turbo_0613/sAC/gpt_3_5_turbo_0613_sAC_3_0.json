'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' is true.\n2. 'The book is a mystery novel' is true.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if the book was indeed written by James, then it is a mystery novel. However, this does not necessarily mean that James is the only author who could have written a mystery novel. It is possible that other authors could have also written mystery novels.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the book in question is a mystery novel. This does not provide any information about who the author might be.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that 'The book was written by James' is true. Other authors could have written mystery novels, so it is possible that someone other than James wrote this particular mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: No",
