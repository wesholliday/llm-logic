This means that whenever the cake is chocolate, the muffins will always be blueberry.\n\nFrom statement 2, we are given the information that the muffins were indeed blueberry.\n\nNow, based on these two statements, we can conclude that the muffins being blueberry is consistent with the first statement. However, we cannot definitively determine the flavor of the cake based on this information alone. It is possible that the cake could be chocolate, but it could also be another flavor.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
