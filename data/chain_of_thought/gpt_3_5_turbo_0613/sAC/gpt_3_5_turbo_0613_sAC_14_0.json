'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den' is true.\n2. 'The wolf was in the den' is true.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. This means that whenever the bear is in the cave, the wolf is also in the den.\n\nFrom the second statement, we are directly told that the wolf was in the den.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the wolf was indeed in the den. However, we cannot definitively determine whether the bear was in the cave or not. The first statement only tells us that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den, but it does not provide any information about the bear's actual location.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
