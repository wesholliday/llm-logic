It states that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. This statement does not provide any information about whether Ben actually ate pasta or not. It only establishes a relationship between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating salad.\n\nThe second statement, \"Kate ate salad,\" tells us that Kate did indeed eat salad. However, it does not provide any direct information about whether Ben ate pasta or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude whether Ben ate pasta or not. The truth value of the statement \"Ben ate pasta\" cannot be determined from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
