It states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. \n\nWe are also given the information that \"Chris finished the race\" is true. \n\nFrom this information, we can conclude that if the condition of the conditional statement is true (Alex finished the race), then the result (Chris finished the race) must also be true. \n\nTherefore, it follows that Alex finished the race. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
