It implies that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim.\n\n2. \"The pants were denim\" is true.\n   This statement directly states that the pants were denim.\n\nBased on the given information, we know that the pants were denim. According to the conditional statement, if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. Since the pants being denim is true, it satisfies the condition of the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, it follows that 'The shirt was cotton' is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
