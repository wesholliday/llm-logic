'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest' is true.\n2. 'The unicorn was in the forest' is true.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was also in the forest. However, this does not necessarily mean that the griffin was actually in the forest. It only establishes a conditional relationship between the griffin and the unicorn.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the unicorn was indeed in the forest. This information does not provide any direct information about the griffin.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude whether the griffin was in the forest or not. The truth value of the statement 'The griffin was in the forest' remains unknown.\n\nAnswer: No",
