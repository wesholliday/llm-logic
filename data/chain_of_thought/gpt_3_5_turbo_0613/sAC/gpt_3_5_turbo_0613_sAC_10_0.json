The statement 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside' is true.\n   This means that whenever the dog is inside, it implies that the cat is outside. However, it does not provide any information about what happens when the cat is outside.\n\n2. The statement 'The cat was outside' is true.\n   This tells us that the cat was indeed outside, but it does not provide any information about the dog's location.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude whether the dog was inside or not. The truth of the statement 'The dog was inside' cannot be determined solely based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
