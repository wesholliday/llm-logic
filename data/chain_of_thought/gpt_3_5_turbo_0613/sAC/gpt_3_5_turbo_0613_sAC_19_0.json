            "content": "To determine if it follows that 'Tom watched football' is true, we need to analyze the given information. \n\nThe statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is a conditional statement. It states that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. \n\nThe second statement \"Jen watched basketball\" is a separate piece of information. \n\nBased on this information, we can conclude the following:\n\n1. If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n2. Jen watched basketball.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude whether Tom watched football or not. It is possible that Tom watched football and Jen watched basketball, which would satisfy both statements. However, it is also possible that Tom did not watch football, and the first statement is still true because it only states what would happen if Tom did watch football.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
