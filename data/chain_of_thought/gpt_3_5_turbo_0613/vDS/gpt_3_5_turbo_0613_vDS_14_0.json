            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nThe first premise states that \"Either the milk is on the counter or it is chilling in the fridge.\" This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the options must be true. \n\nThe second premise states that \"The milk isn't chilling in the fridge.\" This eliminates one of the options mentioned in the first premise, leaving only the possibility that the milk is on the counter.\n\nIf we combine the information from the premises, we can conclude that the milk must be on the counter because it cannot be chilling in the fridge. \n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
