This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the options must be true.\n\nThe second premise states that the remote control is not hiding under the couch. This eliminates one of the options mentioned in the first premise.\n\nGiven these premises, we can conclude that the remote control must be on the coffee table because it cannot be hiding under the couch.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
