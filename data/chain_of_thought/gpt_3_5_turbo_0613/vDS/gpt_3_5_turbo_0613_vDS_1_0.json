            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nThe first premise states that either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden. This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the options must be true. \n\nThe second premise states that Fido is not in the garden. This eliminates the possibility of Fido being in the garden, leaving only the option of Fido being inside.\n\nGiven these premises, the conclusion 'Fido is inside' logically follows because it is the only remaining possibility.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
