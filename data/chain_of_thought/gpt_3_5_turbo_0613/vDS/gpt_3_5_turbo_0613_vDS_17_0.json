The second premise states that the scarf is not draped on the coat rack.\n\nIf we assume that the two options presented in the first premise are exhaustive (i.e., there are no other possibilities), then the negation of one option (the scarf not being draped on the coat rack) would logically lead to the other option (the scarf being stuffed in the backpack).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
