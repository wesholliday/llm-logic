It states that the toy is either in the toy box or sitting on the shelf. The second premise states that the toy is not sitting on the shelf.\n\nIf we assume that the premises are true, then the only possibility left is that the toy is in the toy box. This is because the first premise presents two mutually exclusive options, and the second premise eliminates one of those options.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that the toy is in the toy box logically follows from the premises. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
