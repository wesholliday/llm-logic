It states that the umbrella is either in the car or tucked away in the closet. The second premise denies that the umbrella is tucked away in the closet.\n\nIf we assume that the premises are true, and if the first premise is true, then the only remaining possibility is that the umbrella is in the car. This is because the second premise denies the possibility of the umbrella being tucked away in the closet.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that the umbrella is in the car logically follows from the premises. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
