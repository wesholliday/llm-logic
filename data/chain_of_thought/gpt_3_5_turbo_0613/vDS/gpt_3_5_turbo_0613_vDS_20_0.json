Disjunctive syllogism states that if we have a disjunction (A or B) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false (\u00acB), then the other disjunct must be true (A).\n\nIn this case, the first premise states that either the sunglasses are in her bag (A) or they are perched on her head (B). The second premise states that the sunglasses are not perched on her head (\u00acB). Therefore, according to the disjunctive syllogism, the conclusion that the sunglasses are in her bag (A) logically follows.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
