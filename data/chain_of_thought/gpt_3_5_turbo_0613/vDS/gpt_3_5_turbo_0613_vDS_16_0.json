The second premise states that the pen is not on the desk. \n\nIf we assume that the two premises are true, then the only remaining possibility is that the pen must be in the bag. This is because the first premise presents a disjunction (either/or statement), and if one option is negated (the pen is not on the desk), then the other option must be true (the pen is in the bag). \n\nTherefore, the conclusion 'The pen is in my bag' logically follows from the given premises. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
