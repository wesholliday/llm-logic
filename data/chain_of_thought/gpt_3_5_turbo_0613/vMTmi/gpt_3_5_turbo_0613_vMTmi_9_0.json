            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This is a conditional statement, and it establishes a relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt.\n\nThe second premise states that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. This introduces the possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This conclusion is based on the possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nTo evaluate the logical validity, we need to consider whether the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. In this case, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises. The possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt does not guarantee that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. There could be other reasons why Lisa did not buy the red shirt, unrelated to Mark's purchase.\n\nAnswer: No",
