            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"the car was red\" and the consequent is \"the truck must have been blue.\"\n\nThe second premise states that the truck might not have been blue. This introduces a possibility that contradicts the consequent of the first premise.\n\nGiven these premises, we can see that the argument is in the form of a modus tollens, which is a valid logical form. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, then we can conclude that A must also be false.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is the conditional statement \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\" The second premise states that \"The truck might not have been blue,\" which means that the consequent of the first premise (the truck being blue) is false.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure of the argument, we can conclude that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
