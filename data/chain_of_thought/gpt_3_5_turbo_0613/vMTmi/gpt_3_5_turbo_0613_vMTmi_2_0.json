            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument. \n\nThe first premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest. This can be represented as: \nIf A, then B.\n\nThe second premise states that the unicorn might not have been in the forest. This can be represented as: \nNot B.\n\nThe conclusion states that the griffin was not in the forest. This can be represented as: \nNot A.\n\nTo evaluate the logical validity, we can use a technique called modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that states if we have a conditional statement (If A, then B) and the consequent (B) is false, then we can conclude that the antecedent (A) is also false.\n\nIn this case, the argument follows the form of modus tollens. If the unicorn might not have been in the forest (Not B), then we can conclude that the griffin was not in the forest (Not A).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
