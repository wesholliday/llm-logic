            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry. This can be represented as: \nP1: Cake is chocolate \u2192 Muffins are blueberry\n\nThe second premise states that the muffins might not have been blueberry. This can be represented as:\nP2: \u00acMuffins are blueberry\n\nThe conclusion is that the cake was not chocolate. This can be represented as:\nC: \u00acCake is chocolate\n\nTo evaluate the logical validity, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. In this case, we can use a method called modus tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and the consequent (Q) is false, then we can conclude that the antecedent (P) is also false.\n\nApplying modus tollens to the first premise, we have:\nP1: Cake is chocolate \u2192 Muffins are blueberry\n\u00acMuffins are blueberry\nTherefore, \u00acCake is chocolate\n\nSince the conclusion follows logically from the premises, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
