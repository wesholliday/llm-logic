            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and the consequent is \"Sue must have been at the wedding.\"\n\nThe second premise states that Sue might not have been at the wedding. This introduces the possibility that Sue was not present at the wedding.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is \"Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nTo evaluate the logical validity, we need to consider whether the premises logically support the conclusion. In this case, the first premise establishes a necessary condition for Mary's presence at the wedding, but it does not establish that Mary's presence is the only way Sue could have been at the wedding. The second premise introduces the possibility that Sue was not at the wedding, which weakens the connection between Mary's presence and Sue's presence.\n\nGiven these considerations, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
