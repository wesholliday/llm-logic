            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe first premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. This can be represented as: Jeff played basketball \u2192 Amy played tennis.\n\nThe second premise states that Amy might not have played tennis. This can be represented as: \u00acAmy played tennis.\n\nThe conclusion is that Jeff did not play basketball. This can be represented as: \u00acJeff played basketball.\n\nTo evaluate the logical validity, we need to check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. In this case, we can use a method called modus tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (p \u2192 q) and the consequent (q) is false, then we can conclude that the antecedent (p) is also false.\n\nApplying modus tollens to the first premise, we have: Jeff played basketball \u2192 Amy played tennis. Since the second premise states that Amy did not play tennis (\u00acAmy played tennis), we can conclude that Jeff did not play basketball (\u00acJeff played basketball).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
