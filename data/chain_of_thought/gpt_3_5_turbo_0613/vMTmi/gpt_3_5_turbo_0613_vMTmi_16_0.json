            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. This can be represented as: \nP1: Shirt is cotton \u2192 Pants are denim\n\nThe second premise states that the pants might not have been denim. This can be represented as:\nP2: \u00acPants are denim\n\nThe conclusion is that the shirt was not cotton. This can be represented as:\nC: Shirt is not cotton\n\nTo evaluate the logical validity, we need to see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In this case, we can use a method called modus tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and the consequent (Q) is false, then we can conclude that the antecedent (P) is also false.\n\nApplying modus tollens to the first premise, we have:\nP1: Shirt is cotton \u2192 Pants are denim\n\u00acPants are denim\nTherefore, we can conclude:\n\u00acShirt is cotton\n\nSince the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises using a valid logical inference, we can say that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
