This is a conditional statement, and it does not provide any information about whether Joe actually went to the park or not.\n\nThe second premise states that Lucy might not have gone to the zoo. This introduces the possibility that Lucy did not go to the zoo, which means the first premise might not be true.\n\nGiven these premises, we cannot definitively conclude that Joe did not go to the park. The argument does not provide enough information to establish a necessary connection between Joe not going to the park and Lucy not going to the zoo.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
