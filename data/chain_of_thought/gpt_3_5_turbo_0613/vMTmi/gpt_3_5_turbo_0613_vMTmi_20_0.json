This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"the apple was red\" and the consequent is \"the banana must have been yellow.\"\n\nThe second premise states that the banana might not have been yellow. This introduces a possibility that contradicts the consequent of the first premise.\n\nGiven these premises, we can see that the conclusion \"the apple was not red\" does not necessarily follow. The possibility that the banana might not have been yellow does not directly negate the antecedent of the first premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
