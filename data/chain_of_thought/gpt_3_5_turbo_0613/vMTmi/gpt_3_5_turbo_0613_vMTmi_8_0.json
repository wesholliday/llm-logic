            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake. This can be represented as: V -> M.\n\nThe second premise states that the mummy might not have been awake. This can be represented as: ~M.\n\nThe conclusion is that the vampire was not awake. This can be represented as: ~V.\n\nTo determine if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises, we can use a method called modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (p -> q) and the negation of the consequent (~q), then we can infer the negation of the antecedent (~p).\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is V -> M, and the negation of the consequent is ~M. Therefore, we can infer the negation of the antecedent, which is ~V.\n\nBased on the logical structure of the argument and the application of modus tollens, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
