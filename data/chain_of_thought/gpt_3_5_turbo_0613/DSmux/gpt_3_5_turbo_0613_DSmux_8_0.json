This means that at least one of these conditions must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not the case that the sprocket must be daggled. In other words, we can conclude that the sprocket is not required to be daggled.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that the sprocket is cranked. This is because if the sprocket is not required to be daggled and at least one of the conditions in statement 1 must be true, then the only remaining possibility is that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
