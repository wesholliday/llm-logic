This is because the statement presents a logical disjunction (either/or) where one of the options must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not the case that the smip must be lupped. This means that the second option in statement 1 (the smip must be lupped) is false.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the smip is shripped. This is because if the smip is not shripped, it must be lupped, but we know that it is not the case that the smip must be lupped.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
