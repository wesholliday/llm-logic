This statement establishes a logical disjunction (OR) between the two options.\n\nStatement 2 negates the possibility that the fleeg must be surned. In other words, it states that it is not necessary for the fleeg to be surned.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\nIf the fleeg must be surned, then it cannot be bluttered. However, statement 2 tells us that the fleeg does not have to be surned. Therefore, it is possible that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer that \"The fleeg is bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
