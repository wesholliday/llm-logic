This means that at least one of these options must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not the case that the grommet must be plopped. In other words, the second possibility mentioned in statement 1 is false.\n\nIf the second possibility is false, then the only remaining option is that the grommet is sploffed. Therefore, we can infer that \"The grommet is sploffed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
