This means that at least one of these options must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not the case that the dreb must be spened. In other words, the second possibility mentioned in statement 1 is false.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the only remaining possibility is that \"The dreb is vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
