This means that at least one of these options must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not the case that the flugel must be zargled. In other words, it is not necessary for the flugel to be zargled.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the flugel must be blimmed. This is because if it is not necessary for the flugel to be zargled, and at least one of the options in statement 1 must be true, then the only remaining possibility is that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
