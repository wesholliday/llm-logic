This is because the statement presents a disjunction (either/or) where one of the options must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not the case that the fribble must be crinked. This means that the fribble cannot be exclusively crinked.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that the fribble must be snurgled because it cannot be exclusively crinked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
