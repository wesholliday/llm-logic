This statement establishes a logical disjunction (OR) between the two options.\n\nStatement 2 negates the second option from statement 1. It tells us that it is not the case that the glip must be tragged.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the glip is slogged. This is because if the glip must be tragged, it would contradict statement 2. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
