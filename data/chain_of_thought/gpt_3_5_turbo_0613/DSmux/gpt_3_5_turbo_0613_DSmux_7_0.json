This is because the statement presents a disjunction (either/or) where one of the options must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not the case that the whiffle must be tinked. This means that the second option in statement 1 (it must be tinked) is false.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that the first option in statement 1 (the whiffle is shanked) must be true. This is because if the second option (it must be tinked) is false, then the first option (the whiffle is shanked) must be true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
