This means that at least one of these options must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not the case that the splat must be quanked. In other words, the second possibility mentioned in statement 1 is false.\n\nIf the second possibility is false, then the only remaining option is that the splat is morphed. Therefore, we can infer that \"The splat is morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
