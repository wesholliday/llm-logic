This is because the statement presents a disjunction (either/or) where one of the options must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not the case that the smonk must be plagged. This means that the smonk cannot be exclusively plagged.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that the smonk must be vreebled. This is because if the smonk is not vreebled, it would have to be plagged according to statement 1. However, statement 2 tells us that the smonk cannot be exclusively plagged, so it must be vreebled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
