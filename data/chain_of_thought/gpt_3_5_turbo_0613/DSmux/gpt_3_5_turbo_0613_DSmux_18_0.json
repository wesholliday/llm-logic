This is because the statement presents a disjunction (either/or) where one of the options must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not the case that the shank must be nugged. This means that the shank is not necessarily nugged.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that the shank is plooked because if it were not plooked, it would have to be nugged according to statement 1. However, statement 2 tells us that it is not the case that the shank must be nugged, so the only remaining option is that the shank is plooked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
