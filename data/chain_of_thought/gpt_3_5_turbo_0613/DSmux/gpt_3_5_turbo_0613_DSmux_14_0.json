This means that at least one of these two conditions must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not the case that the clug must be snugged. In other words, it is not necessary for the clug to be snugged.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the clug must be fleeked. This is because if it is not necessary for the clug to be snugged, and at least one of the conditions in statement 1 must be true, then the only remaining possibility is that the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
