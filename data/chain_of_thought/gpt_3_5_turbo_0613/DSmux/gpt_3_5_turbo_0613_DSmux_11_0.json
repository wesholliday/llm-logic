It implies that one of these options must be true.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed.\"\n   This statement negates the possibility that the flug must be zimmed. In other words, it states that the flug being zimmed is not true.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that if the flug is not zimmed, then it must be blummed. However, we cannot definitively infer that \"The flug is blummed\" because there could be other possibilities or information that we are not aware of.\n\nAnswer: No",
