This means that at least one of these conditions must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not the case that the wug must be garpled. In other words, it is not necessary for the wug to be garpled.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the wug must be sproinged. This is because if it is not necessary for the wug to be garpled (as stated in statement 2), and the wug must be either sproinged or garpled (as stated in statement 1), then the only remaining possibility is that the wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
