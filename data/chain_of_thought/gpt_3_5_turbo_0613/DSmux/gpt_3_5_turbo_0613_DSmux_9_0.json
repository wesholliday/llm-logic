This means that at least one of these statements is true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not the case that the twonk must be plinked. In other words, the second possibility mentioned in statement 1 (the twonk must be plinked) is false.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the first possibility mentioned in statement 1 (the twonk is varnished) must be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The twonk is varnished.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
