It implies that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate definitely ate the salad.\n\n2. \"Ben did not eat pasta\": This statement tells us that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\n- Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities:\n\n1. If Ben did eat pasta, then Kate definitely ate the salad. However, since we know that Ben did not eat pasta, this possibility is eliminated.\n\n2. If Ben did not eat pasta, then we cannot determine whether Kate ate the salad or not. The first statement does not provide any information about what happens if Ben does not eat pasta.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Kate did not eat the salad based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
