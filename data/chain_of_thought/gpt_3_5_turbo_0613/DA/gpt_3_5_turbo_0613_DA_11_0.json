It implies that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry.\n\n2. \"The cake was not chocolate.\"\nThis statement tells us that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nBased on these statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- Since the cake was not chocolate, we cannot conclude anything about the flavor of the muffins based on the first statement. The conditional relationship between the cake being chocolate and the muffins being blueberry does not apply because the cake is not chocolate.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the muffins were not blueberry based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
