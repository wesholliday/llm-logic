            "content": "To determine if we can infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, we need to analyze the given statements logically.\n\n1. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\nThis statement establishes a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. It implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark definitely bought the blue shirt.\n\n2. \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\nThis statement tells us that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n- Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively infer whether Mark bought the blue shirt or not. The first statement establishes a conditional relationship, but it does not provide any information about what happens if Lisa did not buy the red shirt. It is possible that Mark still bought the blue shirt even if Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
