It states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This means that if Alex did not finish the race, we cannot conclude anything about Chris.\n\nThe second statement, \"Alex did not finish the race,\" tells us that Alex did not finish the race. However, it does not provide any information about Chris.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot infer whether Chris finished the race or not. The information provided is not sufficient to make a conclusion about Chris.\n\nAnswer: No",
