            "content": "To determine if we can infer that Jen did not watch basketball, we need to analyze the given information. \n\nThe first statement, \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball,\" is a conditional statement. It suggests that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if Tom did not watch football.\n\nThe second statement, \"Tom did not watch football,\" tells us that Tom did not watch football. This means that the condition in the first statement, \"If Tom watched football,\" is not satisfied.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot directly infer whether Jen watched basketball or not. The first statement only tells us what happens if Tom watched football, but it does not provide any information about what happens if Tom did not watch football. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether Jen watched basketball or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
