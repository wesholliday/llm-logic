It implies that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n\n2. \"Sam did not take a plane.\"\n   This statement tells us that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If Sam took a plane, Erin took a train.\n- Sam did not take a plane.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer whether Erin took a train or not. The first statement only establishes a relationship between Sam taking a plane and Erin taking a train. It does not provide any information about what happens if Sam does not take a plane.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer whether Erin took a train or not based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
