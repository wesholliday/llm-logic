It implies that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy definitely played tennis.\n\n2. \"Jeff did not play basketball.\"\nThis statement tells us that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- Since Jeff did not play basketball, we cannot determine whether the condition in the first statement (Jeff playing basketball) is true or false. Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether Amy played tennis or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
