This is because the statement establishes a conditional relationship between Mary and Sue's presence at the wedding.\n\nHowever, statement 2 tells us that Mary was not at the wedding. This means that the antecedent of the conditional statement in statement 1 is false. In formal logic, when the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the truth value of the entire statement is considered true, regardless of the consequent.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer anything about Sue's presence at the wedding based on the given information. It is possible that Sue was at the wedding or not, as the truth value of the conditional statement in statement 1 remains undetermined.\n\nAnswer: No",
