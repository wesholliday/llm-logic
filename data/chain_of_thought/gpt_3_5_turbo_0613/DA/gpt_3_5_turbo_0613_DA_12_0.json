It implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\n2. \"Joe did not go to the park.\"\n   This statement tells us that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that Joe did not go to the park. Since the first statement establishes a conditional relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo, and we know that Joe did not go to the park, we can infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
