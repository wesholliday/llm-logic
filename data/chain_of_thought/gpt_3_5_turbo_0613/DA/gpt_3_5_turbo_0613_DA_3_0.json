            "content": "To determine if we can infer that the book is not a mystery novel, we need to analyze the given statements logically.\n\n1. \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\"\n   This statement establishes a conditional relationship between James being the author and the book being a mystery novel. It implies that if James is the author, then the book is definitely a mystery novel.\n\n2. \"The book was not written by James.\"\n   This statement negates the condition that James is the author of the book.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel.\n- The book was not written by James.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively infer that the book is not a mystery novel. The second statement does not provide any information about the genre of the book. It only tells us that James is not the author. There could be other authors who write mystery novels, so it is still possible that the book is a mystery novel even though James did not write it.\n\nAnswer: No",
