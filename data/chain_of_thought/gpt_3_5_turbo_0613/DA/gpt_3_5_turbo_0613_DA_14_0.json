This is an example of a conditional statement.\n\nFrom statement 2, we are given that the bear was not in the cave. This means that the condition of the conditional statement in statement 1 is not satisfied.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer that the wolf was not in the den based on these two statements alone. The absence of the bear in the cave does not provide any information about the wolf's location.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the wolf was not in the den based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
