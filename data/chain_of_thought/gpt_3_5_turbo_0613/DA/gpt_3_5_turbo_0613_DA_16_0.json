This means that the first part of statement 1, \"the shirt was cotton,\" is false. \n\nIn a conditional statement (if-then statement) like statement 1, if the hypothesis (the part after \"if\") is false, then the conclusion (the part after \"then\") can be either true or false. \n\nSince the hypothesis \"the shirt was cotton\" is false, we cannot determine the truth value of the conclusion \"the pants were denim.\" It could be true or false. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"the pants were not denim\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
