            "content": "To determine if we can infer that the truck was not metal, we need to analyze the given statements logically.\n\n1. \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\nThis statement establishes a conditional relationship between the doll and the truck. It states that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. However, it does not provide any information about the truck if the doll is not plastic.\n\n2. \"The doll was not plastic.\"\nThis statement tells us that the doll is not plastic. It does not provide any direct information about the truck.\n\nBased on these statements, we cannot directly infer that the truck was not metal. The first statement only establishes a relationship between the doll and the truck when the doll is plastic. Since we know the doll is not plastic, we cannot make any conclusions about the truck's material.\n\nAnswer: No",
