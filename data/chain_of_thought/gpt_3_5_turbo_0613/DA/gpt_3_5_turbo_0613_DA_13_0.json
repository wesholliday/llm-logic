            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'The truck was not blue' from the given statements, let's analyze the logic step by step:\n\n1. The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" implies that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. This is a conditional statement.\n\n2. The statement \"The car was not red\" tells us that the car is not red. This is a negation of the first part of the conditional statement.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If the car is red, then the truck is blue.\n- The car is not red.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. If the car is red (which we know it is not), then the truck is blue. However, since the car is not red, we cannot conclude anything about the color of the truck.\n\n2. If the car is not red, then we have no information about the color of the truck. It could be blue or any other color.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The truck was not blue\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
