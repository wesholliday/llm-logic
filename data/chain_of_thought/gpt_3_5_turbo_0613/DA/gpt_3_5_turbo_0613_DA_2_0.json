This is an example of a conditional statement.\n\nFrom statement 2, we are given that the griffin was not in the forest. This means that the condition of the conditional statement in statement 1 is not satisfied.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that the unicorn was not in the forest, we need to consider the truth value of the conditional statement when the condition is false. In this case, since the griffin was not in the forest, the condition is false.\n\nWhen the condition of a conditional statement is false, the truth value of the statement as a whole is not determined. It could be true or false. Therefore, we cannot infer whether the unicorn was in the forest or not based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
