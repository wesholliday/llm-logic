This means that it could be something other than zargled.\n\nStatement 2 presents two possibilities: either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled. This statement does not exclude the possibility that the flugel is not zargled, as stated in statement 1.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The flugel is blimmed\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
