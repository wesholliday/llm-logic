This means that it is uncertain whether the sneg is sproted or not.\n\nStatement 2 presents two possibilities: either the sneg is crampled or it must be sproted. This statement does not provide any information about the actual state of the sneg.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot definitively infer that \"The sneg is crampled.\" The statements only provide possibilities and uncertainty, but no direct evidence or logical connection to support the inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
