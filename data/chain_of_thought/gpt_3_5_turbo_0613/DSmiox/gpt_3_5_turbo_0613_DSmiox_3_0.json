This means that it could be either quanked or not quanked.\n\nStatement 2 presents two possibilities: either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked. This statement does not exclude the possibility that the splat is not quanked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The splat is morphed\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
