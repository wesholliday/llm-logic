It does not provide any information about whether the fleeg is bluttered or not.\n\n2. \"Either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned.\"\n   This statement presents two possibilities: either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned. It does not exclude the possibility that the fleeg is not bluttered.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot directly infer that \"The fleeg is bluttered.\" The statements only provide possibilities and do not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion about the bluttered status of the fleeg.\n\nAnswer: No",
