This means that it could be either plopped or not plopped.\n\nStatement 2 presents two possibilities: either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped. This means that if the grommet is not sploffed, it must be plopped.\n\nConsidering both statements together, we can conclude that if the grommet is not plopped, it must be sploffed. However, we cannot definitively infer that \"The grommet is sploffed\" because there is still a possibility that the grommet is plopped.\n\nAnswer: No",
