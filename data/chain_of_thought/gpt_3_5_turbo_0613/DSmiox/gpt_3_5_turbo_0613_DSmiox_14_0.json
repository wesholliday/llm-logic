This means that snugging is not guaranteed.\n\nStatement 2 presents two possibilities: either the clug is fleeked or it must be snugged. This statement does not exclude the possibility that the clug is not snugged.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The clug is fleeked\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
