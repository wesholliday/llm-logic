This means that it could be either daggled or not daggled.\n\nStatement 2 presents two possibilities: either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled. This means that if the sprocket is not cranked, it must be daggled.\n\nBased on these statements, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The sprocket is cranked.\" The possibility remains that the sprocket is not cranked but instead daggled.\n\nAnswer: No",
