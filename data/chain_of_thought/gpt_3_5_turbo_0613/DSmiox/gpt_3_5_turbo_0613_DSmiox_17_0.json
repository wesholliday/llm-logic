This means that it is not certain whether the flob is movated or not.\n\nStatement 2 presents two possibilities: either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated. This statement does not provide any information about the actual state of the flob. It only states that if the flob is not skizzled, then it must be movated.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot definitively infer that \"The flob is skizzled.\" The statements do not provide enough information to make a conclusive determination about the skizzled state of the flob.\n\nAnswer: No",
