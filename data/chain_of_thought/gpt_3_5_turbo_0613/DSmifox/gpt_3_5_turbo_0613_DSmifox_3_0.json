It does not provide any information about whether the splat is morphed or not.\n\n2. \"Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed.\"\n   This statement presents two possibilities: either the splat is quanked or it is morphed. It does not exclude the possibility that the splat is both quanked and morphed, or neither quanked nor morphed.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot directly infer that \"The splat is morphed.\" The statements only provide possibilities and do not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion about the splat being morphed.\n\nAnswer: No",
