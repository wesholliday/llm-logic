This means that it could be either snugged or not snugged.\n\nStatement 2 presents two possibilities: either the clug must be snugged or it is fleeked. This means that if the clug is not snugged, then it must be fleeked.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that if the clug is not snugged, it is fleeked. However, we cannot definitively determine whether the clug is fleeked or not, as there is still a possibility that it could be snugged.\n\nAnswer: No",
