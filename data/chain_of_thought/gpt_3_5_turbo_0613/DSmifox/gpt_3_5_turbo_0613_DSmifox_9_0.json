This means that it could be either plinked or not plinked.\n\nStatement 2 presents two possibilities: either the twonk must be plinked or it is varnished. This means that if the twonk is not plinked, it must be varnished.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively conclude that the twonk is varnished based on the given information. It is still possible that the twonk is plinked but not varnished.\n\nAnswer: No",
