It does not provide any information about whether the shank is plooked or not.\n\n2. \"Either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked.\"\n   This statement presents two possibilities: either the shank is nugged or it is plooked. It does not exclude the possibility that the shank is both nugged and plooked, or that it is neither nugged nor plooked.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot directly infer that \"The shank is plooked.\" The statements only provide possibilities and do not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion about the plooked status of the shank.\n\nAnswer: No",
