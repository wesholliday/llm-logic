It does not provide any information about whether the flugel is blimmed or not.\n\n2. \"Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed.\"\n   This statement presents two possibilities: either the flugel is zargled or it is blimmed. It does not exclude the possibility that the flugel is both zargled and blimmed, nor does it provide any information about which possibility is true.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot infer that \"The flugel is blimmed.\" The information provided does not directly or indirectly establish the flugel's blimmed status.",
