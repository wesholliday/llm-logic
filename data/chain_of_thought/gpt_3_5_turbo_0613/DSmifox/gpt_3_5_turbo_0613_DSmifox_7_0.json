This means that it could be tinked or not tinked.\n\nStatement 2 presents two possibilities: either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked. This means that if the whiffle is not tinked, it must be shanked.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively conclude that the whiffle is shanked based on the given information. It is still possible that the whiffle is tinked.\n\nAnswer: No",
