This means that it could be surned or not surned.\n\nStatement 2 presents two possibilities: either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered. This means that if the fleeg is not surned, it must be bluttered.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively conclude that the fleeg is bluttered based on the given information. It is still possible that the fleeg is surned.\n\nAnswer: No",
