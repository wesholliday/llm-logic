This means that it could be plagged or not plagged.\n\nStatement 2 presents two possibilities: either the smonk is plagged or it is vreebled. This statement does not exclude the possibility that the smonk is not plagged.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The smonk is vreebled\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
