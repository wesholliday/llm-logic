This means that it could be either plopped or not plopped.\n\nStatement 2 presents two possibilities: either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed. This means that if the grommet is not plopped, it must be sploffed.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that if the grommet is not plopped, it is sploffed. However, we cannot definitively determine whether the grommet is sploffed or not without additional information.\n\nAnswer: No",
