It establishes a relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. \n\nThe second statement, \"Lisa bought the red shirt,\" provides a fact about Lisa's purchase. \n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that if the first statement is true and Lisa did indeed buy the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This is because the first statement establishes a cause-and-effect relationship between Lisa's purchase and Mark's purchase. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: Yes.",
