It establishes a relationship between Sam taking a plane and Erin taking a train. It implies that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n\nThe second statement, \"Sam took a plane,\" provides information about Sam's mode of transportation.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that if the first statement is true and Sam did indeed take a plane (as stated in the second statement), then Erin must have taken a train. This is because the first statement establishes a logical connection between Sam taking a plane and Erin taking a train.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: yes.",
