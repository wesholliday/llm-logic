            "content": "To determine if we can infer that Jen watched basketball, we need to analyze the given statements logically.\n\nThe first statement, \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball,\" is a conditional statement. It establishes a relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball. It implies that whenever Tom watches football, Jen will watch basketball.\n\nThe second statement, \"Tom watched football,\" tells us that Tom indeed watched football.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that if the first statement is true and Tom watched football (as stated in the second statement), then Jen must have watched basketball. This is because the first statement establishes a cause-and-effect relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
