            "content": "To determine if we can infer that the truck was metal, we need to analyze the given statements. \n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This statement establishes a relationship between the doll being plastic and the truck being metal. It implies that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal.\n\nThe second statement is a simple statement: \"The doll was plastic.\" This statement tells us that the doll is indeed plastic.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that if the doll is plastic (which is confirmed by the second statement), then the truck must be metal (according to the first statement). Therefore, we can infer that \"The truck was metal.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
