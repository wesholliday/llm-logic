It suggests that whenever Sue chooses pizza, Bob will choose pasta. \n\nThe second statement, \"Sue chose pizza,\" tells us that Sue made the choice of pizza. \n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that if the first statement is true and Sue did choose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: yes.",
