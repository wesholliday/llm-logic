It states that if James is the author, then the book is a mystery novel.\n\nThe second statement, \"The book was written by James,\" provides the information that James is indeed the author of the book.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that if James is the author (which is confirmed in the second statement), then the book is a mystery novel (as stated in the first statement). However, we cannot definitively infer that the book is a mystery novel without additional information.\n\nAnswer: No",
