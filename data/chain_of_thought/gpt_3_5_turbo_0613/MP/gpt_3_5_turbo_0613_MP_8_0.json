            "content": "To determine if we can infer that the mummy was awake, we need to analyze the given statements logically.\n\nThe first statement, \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake,\" establishes a conditional relationship between the vampire and the mummy. It states that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake.\n\nThe second statement, \"The vampire was awake,\" provides information about the vampire's state of being.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake. However, we cannot definitively infer that the mummy is awake solely based on the fact that the vampire is awake. There could be other factors or conditions that determine the mummy's state of being.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
