            "content": "To determine if we can infer that the truck was blue, we need to analyze the given statements. \n\nThe first statement, \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue,\" is a conditional statement. It establishes a relationship between the car being red and the truck being blue. It implies that whenever the car is red, the truck will be blue.\n\nThe second statement, \"The car was red,\" provides information about the car's color.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that if the car is red, then the truck is blue. However, we cannot definitively infer that the truck is blue solely from the fact that the car is red. There could be other conditions or factors that determine the truck's color.\n\nAnswer: No",
