It establishes a relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo. It implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nThe second statement, \"Joe went to the park,\" provides information about Joe's actions.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. However, we cannot definitively infer that Lucy went to the zoo solely based on the fact that Joe went to the park. There could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo, unrelated to Joe's actions.\n\nAnswer: No",
