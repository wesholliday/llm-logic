It states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This means that if the condition (Alex finishing the race) is true, then the result (Chris finishing the race) must also be true. \n\nThe second statement, \"Alex finished the race,\" tells us that Alex indeed finished the race. \n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that the condition of the conditional statement is true (Alex finished the race). Therefore, according to the conditional statement, the result (Chris finished the race) must also be true. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
