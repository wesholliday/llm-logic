It states that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. This means that the robot's visit to Jupiter is dependent on the alien's visit to Mars.\n\nStatement 2 confirms that the alien visited Mars. This information aligns with the condition stated in Statement 1.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that the robot visited Jupiter. Since the alien visited Mars (as stated in Statement 2), and the conditional relationship in Statement 1 indicates that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter, we can conclude that the robot did indeed visit Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
