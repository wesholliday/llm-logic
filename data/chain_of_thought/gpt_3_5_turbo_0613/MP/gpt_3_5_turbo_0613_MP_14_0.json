            "content": "To determine if we can infer that the wolf was in the den, we need to analyze the given statements logically.\n\nThe first statement, \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den,\" is a conditional statement. It establishes a relationship between the bear being in the cave and the wolf being in the den. It implies that whenever the bear is in the cave, the wolf will be in the den.\n\nThe second statement, \"The bear was in the cave,\" provides us with a fact. It tells us that the bear was indeed in the cave.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that if the bear was in the cave (which is true), then the wolf was in the den (according to the first statement). Therefore, we can infer that the wolf was in the den.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
