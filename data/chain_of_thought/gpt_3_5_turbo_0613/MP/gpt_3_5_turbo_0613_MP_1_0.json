This is because the statement establishes a conditional relationship between Mary and Sue's presence at the wedding.\n\nThe second statement tells us that Mary was indeed at the wedding. \n\nNow, based on this information, we can conclude that Sue must have been at the wedding as well. This is because the first statement establishes that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there too. Since we know that Mary was at the wedding, it follows logically that Sue must have been there too.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
