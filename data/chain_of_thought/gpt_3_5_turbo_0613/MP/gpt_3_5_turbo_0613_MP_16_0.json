            "content": "To determine if we can infer that the pants were denim, we need to analyze the given statements. \n\nThe first statement, \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim,\" is a conditional statement. It establishes a relationship between the shirt being cotton and the pants being denim. It implies that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim.\n\nThe second statement, \"The shirt was cotton,\" provides information about the shirt. It tells us that the shirt is indeed cotton.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that if the shirt is cotton (which it is), then the pants must be denim. This is because the first statement establishes a logical connection between the shirt being cotton and the pants being denim.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
