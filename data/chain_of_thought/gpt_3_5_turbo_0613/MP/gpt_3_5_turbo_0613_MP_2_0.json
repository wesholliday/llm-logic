This statement establishes a conditional relationship between the griffin and the unicorn.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the griffin was indeed in the forest. \n\nBased on these two statements, we can infer that the unicorn was in the forest. This is because if the griffin is in the forest (as stated in Statement 2), then the unicorn must also be in the forest (as stated in Statement 1).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
