            "content": "To determine if we can infer that the banana was yellow, we need to analyze the given statements. \n\nThe first statement, \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow,\" is a conditional statement. It establishes a relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana. It states that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow.\n\nThe second statement, \"The apple was red,\" provides information about the color of the apple.\n\nTo infer that the banana was yellow, we need to check if the condition of the conditional statement is satisfied. In this case, the condition is that the apple is red. Since the second statement tells us that the apple is indeed red, we can conclude that the condition is satisfied.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the banana was yellow.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
