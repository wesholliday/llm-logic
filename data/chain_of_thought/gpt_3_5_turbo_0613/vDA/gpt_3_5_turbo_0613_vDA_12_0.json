            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nThe first premise states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. This can be represented as: \nP1: Joe went to the park \u2192 Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nThe second premise states that Joe did not go to the park. This can be represented as: \nP2: \u00acJoe went to the park.\n\nThe conclusion states that Lucy did not go to the zoo. This can be represented as: \nC: \u00acLucy went to the zoo.\n\nTo evaluate the validity, we can use a technique called modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that states if we have a conditional statement (if A, then B) and the consequent (B) is false, then we can conclude that the antecedent (A) is also false.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" The consequent, Lucy going to the zoo, is not mentioned in the premises or the conclusion. Therefore, we cannot apply modus tollens to this argument.\n\nSince we cannot apply a valid logical form to this argument, we cannot determine its validity. \n\nAnswer: No",
