Modus tollens is a valid deductive argument form that states if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false, then we can conclude that P must also be false.\n\nIn this case, the argument follows the form of modus tollens. The first premise is a conditional statement, and the second premise denies the consequent of that conditional statement. Therefore, if the argument is logically valid, the conclusion \"Bob did not choose pasta\" must necessarily follow.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
