            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nThe first premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. This can be represented as: \nP1: Jeff played basketball -> Amy played tennis.\n\nThe second premise states that Jeff did not play basketball. This can be represented as: \nP2: ~Jeff played basketball.\n\nFrom these premises, we can use a valid logical inference rule called Modus Tollens. Modus Tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (P -> Q) and the consequent (Q) is false, then we can infer that the antecedent (P) must also be false. \n\nUsing Modus Tollens, we can infer:\nP3: ~Amy played tennis.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is 'Amy did not play tennis'.\n\nTo summarize:\nP1: Jeff played basketball -> Amy played tennis.\nP2: ~Jeff played basketball.\nC: ~Amy played tennis.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
