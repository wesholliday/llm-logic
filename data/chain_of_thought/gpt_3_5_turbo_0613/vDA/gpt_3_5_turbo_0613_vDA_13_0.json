            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. This can be represented as: \nP1: If A, then B.\n\nThe second premise states that the car was not red. This can be represented as:\nP2: Not A.\n\nThe conclusion states that the truck was not blue. This can be represented as:\nC: Not B.\n\nTo evaluate the logical validity, we can use a technique called modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that states if we have a conditional statement (if A, then B) and the consequent (B) is false, then we can conclude that the antecedent (A) is also false.\n\nIn this case, if we assume that the truck was blue (B), and the first premise is true (if the car was red, then the truck was blue), then we can conclude that the car must have been red (A). However, the second premise states that the car was not red (not A). Therefore, we can conclude that the truck was not blue (not B).\n\nBased on this analysis, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
