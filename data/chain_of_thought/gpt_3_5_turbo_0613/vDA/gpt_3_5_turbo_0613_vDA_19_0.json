            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nThe first premise states that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This can be represented as: \nIf P, then Q.\n\nThe second premise states that Tom did not watch football. This can be represented as: \nNot P.\n\nThe conclusion states that Jen did not watch basketball. This can be represented as: \nNot Q.\n\nTo evaluate the validity of the argument, we can use a method called modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that states if we have an implication (if P, then Q) and the consequent (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\nIn this case, the argument follows the form of modus tollens. The first premise is an implication, and the second premise denies the consequent. Therefore, the argument is logically valid if the premises are true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
