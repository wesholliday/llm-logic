            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nThe first premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This can be represented as: \nP1: If A, then B.\n\nThe second premise states that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This can be represented as: \nP2: Not A.\n\nThe conclusion states that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This can be represented as: \nC: Not B.\n\nTo evaluate the validity, we can use a technique called modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (if A, then B) and the consequent (B) is false, then the antecedent (A) must also be false. \n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" The consequent (B) is \"Mark bought the blue shirt,\" and the antecedent (A) is \"Lisa bought the red shirt.\" \n\nUsing modus tollens, if the consequent (B) is false (Mark did not buy the blue shirt), then the antecedent (A) must also be false (Lisa did not buy the red shirt). \n\nTherefore, based on the premises and the modus tollens reasoning, the conclusion \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" logically follows. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
