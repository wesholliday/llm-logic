            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument. \n\nThe argument is a conditional statement in the form of \"If A, then B.\" The first premise states that if the bear was in the cave (A), then the wolf was in the den (B). The second premise states that the bear was not in the cave, which can be represented as \u00acA (not A). The conclusion is that the wolf was not in the den, which can be represented as \u00acB (not B).\n\nTo evaluate the validity of the argument, we can use a method called modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that states if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false (\u00acB), then we can conclude that A must also be false (\u00acA).\n\nIn this case, the argument follows the form of modus tollens. The first premise is a conditional statement, and the second premise states that the consequent (B) is false (\u00acB). Therefore, we can conclude that the antecedent (A) must also be false (\u00acA).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
