            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nThe first premise states that \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This is a conditional statement, and it means that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue must have also attended.\n\nThe second premise states that \"Mary was not at the wedding.\" This means that Mary did not attend the wedding.\n\nFrom these premises, we can conclude that Sue's presence at the wedding is uncertain. The absence of Mary does not provide any information about whether Sue was present or not. It is possible that Sue attended the wedding even if Mary did not.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Sue was not at the wedding\" does not necessarily follow from the given premises. \n\nAnswer: No",
