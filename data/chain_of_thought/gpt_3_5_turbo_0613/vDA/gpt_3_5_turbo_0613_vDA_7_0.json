            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nThe first premise states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This can be represented as: \nP1: If A, then C\n\nThe second premise states that Alex did not finish the race. This can be represented as: \nP2: Not A\n\nThe conclusion is that Chris did not finish the race. This can be represented as: \nC: Not C\n\nTo evaluate the validity, we can use a technique called modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that states if we have a conditional statement (if A, then B) and the consequent (B) is false, then we can conclude that the antecedent (A) is also false. \n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" (P1: If A, then C). The second premise states that Alex did not finish the race (P2: Not A). \n\nUsing modus tollens, we can conclude that Chris did not finish the race (C: Not C). \n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
