            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nThe first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This can be represented as: \nVampireAwake -> MummyAwake\n\nThe second premise states that the vampire was not awake. This can be represented as: \n~VampireAwake\n\nFrom these premises, we can use a valid logical inference called modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (if-then) and the consequent (the part after the arrow) is false, then we can conclude that the antecedent (the part before the arrow) is also false. \n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"VampireAwake -> MummyAwake\" and the consequent \"MummyAwake\" is false (since the conclusion is \"The mummy was not awake\"). Therefore, we can conclude that the antecedent \"VampireAwake\" is also false.\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can infer that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake. This can be represented as: \n~VampireAwake -> ~MummyAwake\n\nSince the conclusion \"The mummy was not awake\" aligns with this inferred statement, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
