Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, then we can conclude that A must also be false.\n\nIn this case, the first premise states \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" The second premise states \"The cake was not chocolate.\" From these premises, we can conclude that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
