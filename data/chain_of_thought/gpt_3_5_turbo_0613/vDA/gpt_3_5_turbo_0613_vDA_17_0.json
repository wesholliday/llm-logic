            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nThe first premise states that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. This can be represented as: \nP1: Ben ate pasta \u2192 Kate ate salad\n\nThe second premise states that Ben did not eat pasta. This can be represented as: \nP2: \u00acBen ate pasta\n\nFrom these premises, we want to determine if the conclusion that Kate did not eat salad necessarily follows. This can be represented as: \nC: \u00acKate ate salad\n\nTo evaluate the validity of the argument, we can use a method called Modus Tollens. Modus Tollens is a valid form of argumentation that follows the pattern: \nIf P, then Q\nNot Q\nTherefore, not P\n\nIn this case, we can apply Modus Tollens to the first premise: \nIf Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\nNot Kate ate salad\nTherefore, not Ben ate pasta\n\nHowever, the second premise states that Ben did not eat pasta, which aligns with the conclusion of the Modus Tollens application. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
