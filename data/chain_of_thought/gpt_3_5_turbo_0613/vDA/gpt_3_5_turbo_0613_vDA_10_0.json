            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nThe first premise states that \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This can be represented as: \nP1: Dog inside \u2192 Cat outside\n\nThe second premise states that \"The dog was not inside.\" This can be represented as: \nP2: \u00ac(Dog inside)\n\nThe conclusion states that \"The cat was not outside.\" This can be represented as: \nC: \u00ac(Cat outside)\n\nTo evaluate the validity, we can use a method called modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that states if we have a conditional statement (if-then) and the consequent (the part after the 'then') is false, then we can conclude that the antecedent (the part before the 'then') is also false.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" The consequent is \"The cat was outside,\" which is negated in the conclusion as \"The cat was not outside.\"\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can infer that if the consequent is false (the cat was not outside), then the antecedent (the dog was inside) must also be false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
