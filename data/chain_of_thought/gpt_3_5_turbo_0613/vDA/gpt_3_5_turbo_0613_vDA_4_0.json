This can be represented as: \nP1: If A, then R\n\nThe second premise states that the alien did not visit Mars. This can be represented as: \nP2: Not A\n\nThe conclusion is that the robot did not visit Jupiter. This can be represented as: \nC: Not R\n\nTo evaluate the logical validity, we can use a technique called modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that states if we have a conditional statement (if A, then B) and the consequent (B) is false, then we can conclude that the antecedent (A) is also false. \n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\" The consequent (the robot visited Jupiter) is not mentioned in the premises or the conclusion. Therefore, we cannot apply modus tollens to this argument.\n\nSince we cannot apply a valid logical form to the argument, we cannot determine if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nAnswer: No",
