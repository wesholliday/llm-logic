The argument follows a conditional statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" The first premise states that the griffin was not in the forest, which means the antecedent of the conditional statement is false. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the antecedent is false, the truth value of the entire statement is not determined. Therefore, we cannot conclude anything about the truth value of the consequent (the unicorn being in the forest) based on the first premise alone.\n\nSince the argument does not provide sufficient information to determine the truth value of the conclusion, it is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
