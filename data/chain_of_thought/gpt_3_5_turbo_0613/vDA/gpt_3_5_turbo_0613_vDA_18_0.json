            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. This can be represented as: P \u2192 Q, where P represents \"the doll was plastic\" and Q represents \"the truck was metal\".\n\nThe second premise states that the doll was not plastic. This can be represented as: \u00acP.\n\nThe conclusion states that the truck was not metal. This can be represented as: \u00acQ.\n\nTo evaluate the validity of the argument, we can use a method called modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that states if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and the consequent (Q) is false, then we can conclude that the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\nIn this case, the argument follows the form of modus tollens. The first premise is a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q), and the second premise states the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ). Therefore, we can conclude that the antecedent (P) must also be false (\u00acP).\n\nSince the conclusion of the argument aligns with the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP), the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
