            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument can be represented symbolically as follows:\nP1: If A, then B\nP2: Not A\nC: Not B\n\nTo evaluate the validity, we can use a technique called modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, then we can conclude that A must also be false.\n\nIn this case, the first premise states \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" Let's represent this as \"If C, then D\" for simplicity.\n\nUsing modus tollens, if the conclusion \"The pants were not denim\" (Not D) is true, then we can conclude that \"The shirt was not cotton\" (Not C) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
