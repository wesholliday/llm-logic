            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the form of the argument. The argument follows a conditional statement: \"If A, then B.\" The premise states that if the cake was chocolate (A), then the muffins were blueberry (B). The conclusion states that if the cake was not chocolate (not A), then the muffins were not blueberry (not B).\n\nTo evaluate the logical validity, we can use the contrapositive rule. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the contrapositive of the premise would be \"If the muffins were not blueberry (not B), then the cake was not chocolate (not A).\"\n\nIf the argument is logically valid, the conclusion should match the contrapositive of the premise. So, if the contrapositive \"If not B, then not A\" matches the conclusion \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry,\" then the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
