            "content": "To determine if this form of argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This can be represented as: \"If P, then Q.\"\n\nThe conclusion states that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This can be represented as: \"If not P, then not Q.\"\n\nTo evaluate the logical validity, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In this case, the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
