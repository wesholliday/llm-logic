            "content": "To determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument. \n\nThe premise states: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be represented as: P \u2192 Q, where P represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe conclusion states: \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\" This can be represented as: \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ, where \u00acP represents \"Mary was not at the wedding\" and \u00acQ represents \"Sue was not at the wedding.\"\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In this case, we can use the contrapositive rule of inference, which states that if P \u2192 Q is true, then \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP is also true.\n\nApplying the contrapositive rule to the premise, we have: \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, which is equivalent to the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
