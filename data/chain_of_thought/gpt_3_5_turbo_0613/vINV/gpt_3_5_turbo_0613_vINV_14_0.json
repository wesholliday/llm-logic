            "content": "To determine if this form of argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument. \n\nThe premise states: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\" This can be represented as: P \u2192 Q, where P represents \"the bear was in the cave\" and Q represents \"the wolf was in the den.\"\n\nThe conclusion states: \"If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.\" This can be represented as: \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ, where \u00acP represents \"the bear was not in the cave\" and \u00acQ represents \"the wolf was not in the den.\"\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In this case, we can use the contrapositive rule of inference, which states that if P \u2192 Q is true, then \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP is also true.\n\nApplying the contrapositive rule to the premise, we have: \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, which is equivalent to the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
