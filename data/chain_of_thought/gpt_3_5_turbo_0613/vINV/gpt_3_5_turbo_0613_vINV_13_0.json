In this case, we can use the contrapositive rule, which states that if a conditional statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nThe contrapositive of the premise \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\"\n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive to the conclusion: \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\"\n\nSince the contrapositive and the conclusion have the same form, and the contrapositive is true, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
