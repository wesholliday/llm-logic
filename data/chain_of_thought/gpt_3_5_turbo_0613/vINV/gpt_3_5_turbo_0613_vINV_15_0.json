            "content": "To determine if this form of argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. This can be represented as: P \u2192 Q, where P represents \"Sam took a plane\" and Q represents \"Erin took a train.\"\n\nThe conclusion states that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train. This can be represented as: \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ, where \u00acP represents \"Sam did not take a plane\" and \u00acQ represents \"Erin did not take a train.\"\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In this case, we can use the contrapositive rule of inference, which states that if P \u2192 Q is true, then \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP is also true.\n\nApplying the contrapositive rule to the premise, we have: \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, which is the same as the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
