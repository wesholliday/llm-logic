            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the form of the argument. The argument follows a conditional statement: \"If A, then B.\" The premise states that if the griffin was in the forest (A), then the unicorn was in the forest (B). The conclusion states that if the griffin was not in the forest (not A), then the unicorn was not in the forest (not B).\n\nTo evaluate the validity of this argument, we can use the contrapositive rule. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" If the contrapositive is true, then the original conditional statement is also true.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of the premise would be \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\" If we assume that the premise is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
