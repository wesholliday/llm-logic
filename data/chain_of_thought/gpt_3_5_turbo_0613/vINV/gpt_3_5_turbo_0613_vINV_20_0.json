In this case, we can use the contrapositive rule, which states that if a conditional statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nThe contrapositive of the premise is: If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\n\nIf we assume that the premise is true, then the contrapositive must also be true. This means that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
