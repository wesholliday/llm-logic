The argument can be represented symbolically as follows:\n\nPremise: If P, then Q\nConclusion: If not P, then not Q\n\nThis argument follows the form of a valid logical principle known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of an implication states that if the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false. In other words, if \"If P, then Q\" is true, then \"If not Q, then not P\" is also true.\n\nIn this case, the premise \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" can be rewritten as \"If P, then Q.\" The conclusion \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake\" can be rewritten as \"If not P, then not Q.\"\n\nSince the argument follows the form of a valid logical principle (the contrapositive), we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
