            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument. \n\nThe premise states: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This can be represented as: P \u2192 Q, where P represents \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q represents \"Kate ate salad.\"\n\nThe conclusion states: \"If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad.\" This can be represented as: \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ, where \u00acP represents \"Ben did not eat pasta\" and \u00acQ represents \"Kate did not eat salad.\"\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In this case, we can use the contrapositive rule of inference, which states that if a conditional statement P \u2192 Q is true, then its contrapositive \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP is also true.\n\nApplying the contrapositive rule to the premise, we have: \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, which can be interpreted as \"If Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n\nComparing the conclusion (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ) with the contrapositive of the premise (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP), we can see that they have the same logical form. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
