We will consider all possible truth values for P and Q and check if the conclusion is always true when the premise is true.\n\nP | Q | P \u2192 Q | \u00acP | \u00acQ | \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ\n----------------------------------\nT | T |   T   |  F |  F |    T\nT | F |   F   |  F |  T |    T\nF | T |   T   |  T |  F |    F\nF | F |   T   |  T |  T |    T\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that when the premise (P \u2192 Q) is true, the conclusion (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ) is also true in all cases. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
