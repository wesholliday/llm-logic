In this case, the argument follows the form of a valid argument called the contrapositive.\n\nThe contrapositive of the premise P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP. In this case, the conclusion \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ matches the contrapositive form.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
