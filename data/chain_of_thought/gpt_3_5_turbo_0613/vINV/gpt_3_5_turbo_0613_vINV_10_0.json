In this case, we can use the contrapositive rule of inference, which states that if P \u2192 Q is true, then \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP is also true.\n\nApplying the contrapositive rule to the premise, we have: \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, which is equivalent to the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
