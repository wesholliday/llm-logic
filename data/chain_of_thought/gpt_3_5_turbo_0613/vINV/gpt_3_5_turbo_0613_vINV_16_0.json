            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the form of the argument. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\nPremise: If A, then B\nConclusion: If not A, then not B\n\nThis argument follows the form of a valid logical inference known as the contrapositive. In a contrapositive, the conclusion is the negation of the consequent (B) and the premise is the negation of the antecedent (A). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nIn this case, the argument follows the contrapositive form, where the conclusion \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim\" is the negation of the consequent, and the premise \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is the negation of the antecedent.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
