The argument can be represented as follows:\n\nPremise: If A, then B\nConclusion: If not A, then not B\n\nThis argument follows the form of a valid logical rule called contraposition. The contraposition rule states that if a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is true, then its contrapositive \"If not B, then not A\" is also true.\n\nIn this case, the argument follows the contraposition rule, where A represents \"the book was written by James\" and B represents \"the book is a mystery novel.\" The premise states that if A is true, then B is true. The conclusion states that if not A is true (i.e., the book was not written by James), then not B is true (i.e., the book is not a mystery novel).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
