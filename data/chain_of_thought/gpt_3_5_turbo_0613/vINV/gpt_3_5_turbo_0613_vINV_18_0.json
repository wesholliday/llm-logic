The argument can be represented as follows:\n\nPremise: If A, then B.\nConclusion: If not A, then not B.\n\nThis argument follows the form of a valid logical inference known as contraposition. In contraposition, the implication \"If A, then B\" is logically equivalent to \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nSince the argument in question follows this valid form, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
