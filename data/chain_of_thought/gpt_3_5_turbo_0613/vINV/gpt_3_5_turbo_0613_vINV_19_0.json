            "content": "To determine if this form of argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise states that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This can be represented as: \n\nP1: Tom watched football -> Jen watched basketball\n\nThe conclusion states that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball. This can be represented as:\n\nC1: ~Tom watched football -> ~Jen watched basketball\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In other words, we need to see if the conclusion is a valid deduction based on the given premise.\n\nIn this case, the argument is using the form of a conditional statement, specifically the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nThe contrapositive of P1 is:\n\nP1 Contrapositive: ~Jen watched basketball -> ~Tom watched football\n\nComparing the contrapositive to the conclusion (C1), we can see that they are the same statement. Therefore, the conclusion is a valid deduction based on the given premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
