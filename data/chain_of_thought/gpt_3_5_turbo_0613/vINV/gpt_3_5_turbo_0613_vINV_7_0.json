            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the form of the argument. The argument follows a conditional statement: \"If A, then B.\" The premise states that if Alex finished the race (A), then Chris finished the race (B). The conclusion states that if Alex did not finish the race (not A), then Chris did not finish the race (not B).\n\nTo evaluate the logical validity, we can use the principle of contraposition. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. In this case, the contrapositive of the premise would be \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\"\n\nIf the conclusion matches the contrapositive of the premise, then the argument is logically valid. So, let's compare the conclusion (\"If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race\") with the contrapositive of the premise (\"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race\").\n\nAnswer: Yes",
