            "content": "To determine if this form of argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise states that \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be represented as: Jeff played basketball \u2192 Amy played tennis.\n\nThe conclusion states that \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\" This can be represented as: \u00acJeff played basketball \u2192 \u00acAmy played tennis.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In this case, the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise.\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
