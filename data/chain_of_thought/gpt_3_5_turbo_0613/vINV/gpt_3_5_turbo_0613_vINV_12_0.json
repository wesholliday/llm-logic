            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. \n\nThe premise states that \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be represented as: \nP1: Joe went to the park \u2192 Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nThe conclusion states that \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\" This can be represented as: \nC: Joe did not go to the park \u2192 Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nTo evaluate the validity of the argument, we can use a technique called the Law of Contrapositive. According to this law, if a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) is true, then its contrapositive (~Q \u2192 ~P) is also true.\n\nIn this case, the premise can be rewritten in its contrapositive form as: \nP1: If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\n\nComparing the contrapositive of the premise with the conclusion, we can see that they have the same structure and meaning. Both statements state that if one event does not occur, then the other event does not occur. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
