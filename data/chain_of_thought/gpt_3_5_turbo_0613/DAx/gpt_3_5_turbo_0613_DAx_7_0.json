If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked. (Conditional statement)\n2. The whiffle was not shanked. (Given information)\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the whiffle was not shanked. Therefore, we cannot conclude anything about whether the whiffle tinked or not. The absence of shanking does not provide any information about the tink sound.\n\nAnswer: No",
