It implies that if the splat is morphed, then it will quank.\n\n2. \"The splat was not morphed.\"\n   This statement provides the information that the splat was not morphed.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If the splat was morphed, it would quank (from statement 1).\n- However, we know that the splat was not morphed (from statement 2).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the splat did not quank because it did not meet the condition of being morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
