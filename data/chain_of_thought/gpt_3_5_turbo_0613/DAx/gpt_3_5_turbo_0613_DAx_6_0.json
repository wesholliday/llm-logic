However, we don't have any information about what happens if the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot directly infer whether or not the grommet plopped the frink. The second statement does not provide any information about what happens when the grommet is not sploffed. Therefore, we cannot make a conclusion about whether or not the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nAnswer: No",
