However, this does not provide any information about what happens if the shank was not plooked.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the shank was not plooked. Since we don't have any information about what happens when the shank is not plooked, we cannot make any conclusions about whether it was nugged or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The shank was not nugged\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
