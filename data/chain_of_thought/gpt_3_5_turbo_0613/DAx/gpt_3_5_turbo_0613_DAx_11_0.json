(Conditional statement)\n2. The flug was not blummed. (Given information)\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the flug was blummed, then it was zimmed. However, we don't have any information about what happens if the flug was not blummed.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the flug was not blummed. This means that the condition in statement 1 is not satisfied, and we cannot make any conclusions about whether the flug was zimmed or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The flug was not zimmed' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
