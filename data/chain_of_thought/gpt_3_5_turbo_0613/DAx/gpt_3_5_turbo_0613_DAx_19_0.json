If the smonk is vreebled, it will be plagged.\n\n2. \"The smonk was not vreebled.\"\n   This statement tells us that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- Since the smonk was not vreebled, we cannot determine whether it was plagged or not. The first statement only tells us what happens if the smonk is vreebled, but it does not provide any information about what happens if the smonk is not vreebled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The smonk was not plagged\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
