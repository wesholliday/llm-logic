This is an example of a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"the sneg was crampled\" and the consequent is \"the sneg sproted the frink.\"\n\nStatement 2 tells us that \"the sneg was not crampled.\" \n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The sneg did not sprot the frink,\" we need to consider the logical relationship between the statements. \n\nIf the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the truth value of the consequent is irrelevant. In this case, since statement 2 tells us that \"the sneg was not crampled,\" the antecedent of the conditional statement in statement 1 is false. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusions about whether the sneg sproted the frink or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
