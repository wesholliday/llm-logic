If the wug is flooped, then it bims the zoint.\n\n2. \"The wug was not flooped.\"\n   This statement tells us that the wug was not flooped.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- Since the wug was not flooped, we cannot determine whether it bimmed the zoint or not. The first statement only tells us what happens if the wug is flooped, but it does not provide any information about what happens if the wug is not flooped.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The wug did not bim the zoint\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
