This means that skizzled is a necessary condition for movated.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the flob was not skizzled. Since skizzled is a necessary condition for movated, if the flob was not skizzled, we cannot conclude anything about whether it was movated or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The flob was not movated' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
