This is a conditional statement.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'The fribble did not crink', we need to consider the contrapositive of statement 1. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and reversing their order.\n\nThe contrapositive of statement 1 would be: \"If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled.\"\n\nSince statement 2 tells us that the fribble was not snurgled, we can conclude that the fribble did not crink based on the contrapositive of statement 1.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
