It implies that if the sprocket is cranked, then it will be daggled.\n\n2. \"The sprocket was not cranked.\"\nThis statement tells us that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nBased on these statements, we can make the following logical deductions:\n\n- If the sprocket was cranked, then it was daggled. (Statement 1)\n- The sprocket was not cranked. (Statement 2)\n\nFrom these deductions, we cannot directly infer whether or not the sprocket was daggled. The reason is that the first statement establishes a conditional relationship, but it does not provide any information about what happens if the sprocket is not cranked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The sprocket was not daggled\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
