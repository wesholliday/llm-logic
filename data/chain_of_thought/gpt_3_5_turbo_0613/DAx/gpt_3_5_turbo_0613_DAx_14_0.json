It implies that if the clug is fleeked, then it will be snugged.\n\n2. \"The clug was not fleeked\" - This statement tells us that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nBased on these statements, we can make the following logical deductions:\n\n- If the clug was fleeked, then it would be snugged (from the first statement).\n- However, we know that the clug was not fleeked (from the second statement).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that we do not have enough information to infer whether or not the clug was snugged. The second statement does not provide any direct information about the snugging of the clug. It only tells us that the clug was not fleeked.",
