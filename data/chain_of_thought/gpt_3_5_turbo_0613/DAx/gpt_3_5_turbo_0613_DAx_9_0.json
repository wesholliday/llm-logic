This means that plinking is a necessary condition for varnishing.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the twonk was not plinked. Therefore, we can conclude that the necessary condition for varnishing (plinking) did not occur.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can infer that \"The twonk was not varnished.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
