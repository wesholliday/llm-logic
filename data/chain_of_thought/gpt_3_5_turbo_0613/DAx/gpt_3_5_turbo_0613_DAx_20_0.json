This means that if the antecedent (the fleeg was bluttered) is true, then the consequent (it surned) must also be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the fleeg was not bluttered. This means that the antecedent of statement 1 is false.\n\nNow, let's consider the inference we are trying to make: \"The fleeg did not surn.\"\n\nSince the antecedent of statement 1 is false (the fleeg was not bluttered), we cannot determine the truth value of the consequent (it surned). It could be true or false, but we don't have enough information to make a definitive inference.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The fleeg did not surn\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
