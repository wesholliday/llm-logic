If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint. (Conditional statement)\n2. The smip was not shripped. (Given information)\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the smip was not shripped. This means that the condition in statement 1 is not satisfied, as it requires the smip to be shripped. \n\nSince the condition in statement 1 is not met, we cannot make any conclusions about whether the smip lupped the zoint or not. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The smip did not lup the zoint' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
