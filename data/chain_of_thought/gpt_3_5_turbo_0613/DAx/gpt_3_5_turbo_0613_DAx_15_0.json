            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"The dreb was not spened\" from the given statements, let's break down the logic:\n\n1. \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\" - This is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between being vroombed and being spened. It implies that if the dreb is vroombed, then it must be spened.\n\n2. \"The dreb was not vroombed\" - This statement tells us that the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications:\n\n- If the dreb was vroombed, then it must be spened (from the first statement).\n- However, we know that the dreb was not vroombed (from the second statement).\n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively conclude whether the dreb was spened or not. The second statement does not provide enough information to determine the status of being spened.\n\nAnswer: No",
