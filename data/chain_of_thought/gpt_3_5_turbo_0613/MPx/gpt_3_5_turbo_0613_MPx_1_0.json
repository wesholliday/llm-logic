It states that whenever the flugel is blimmed, it is also zargled. This can be represented as \"Blimmed \u2192 Zargled.\"\n\nThe second statement, \"The flugel was blimmed,\" provides the information that the flugel is indeed blimmed.\n\nTo infer \"The flugel was zargled,\" we need to determine if the condition in the first statement is satisfied. Since the second statement confirms that the flugel is blimmed, we can conclude that the condition is met. Therefore, we can infer that \"The flugel was zargled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
