This means that if the condition (smonk being vreebled) is true, then the consequence (smonk being plagged) must also be true.\n\nFrom Statement 2, we are given the information that \"The smonk was vreebled.\"\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that the condition in Statement 1 (smonk being vreebled) is true. Therefore, according to the logical structure of the conditional statement, the consequence (smonk being plagged) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
