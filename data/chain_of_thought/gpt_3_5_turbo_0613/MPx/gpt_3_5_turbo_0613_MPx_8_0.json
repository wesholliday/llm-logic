However, the first statement does not provide any information about what happens if the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the sprocket was cranked. This means that the condition in the first statement is satisfied.\n\nTo infer that the sprocket was daggled, we need to conclude that the second statement implies the second part of the first statement. In other words, we need to determine if the sprocket being cranked guarantees that it was daggled.\n\nAnswer: No",
