It states that if the condition \"the dreb was vroombed\" is true, then the consequence \"the dreb was spened\" must also be true.\n\nThe second statement, \"The dreb was vroombed,\" is a premise that provides the condition mentioned in the first statement.\n\nTo infer \"The dreb was spened,\" we need to confirm that the condition \"the dreb was vroombed\" is true. If the condition is true, then we can conclude that the consequence \"the dreb was spened\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
