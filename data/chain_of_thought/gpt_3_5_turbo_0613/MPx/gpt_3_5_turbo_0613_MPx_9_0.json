It states that if the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\n\n2. \"The twonk was plinked\" - This is a statement that tells us the twonk was indeed plinked.\n\nTo infer \"It was varnished,\" we need to confirm that the condition in the first statement is satisfied, which is that the twonk was plinked. Since the second statement tells us that the twonk was plinked, we can conclude that the condition is met.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"It was varnished.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
