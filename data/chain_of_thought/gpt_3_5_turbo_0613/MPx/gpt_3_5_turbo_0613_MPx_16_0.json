It states that if the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\n\n2. \"The sneg was crampled\" - This is a statement that tells us the sneg was indeed crampled.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If the sneg was crampled (which we know it was), then the sneg sproted the frink.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The sneg sproted the frink.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
