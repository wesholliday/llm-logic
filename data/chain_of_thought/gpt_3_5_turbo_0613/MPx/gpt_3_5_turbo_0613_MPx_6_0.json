It states that if the grommet was sploffed, then it plopped the frink. This means that whenever the grommet is sploffed, it will always plop the frink.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the grommet was indeed sploffed. \n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the grommet plopped the frink. This is because the first statement establishes a logical connection between being sploffed and plopping the frink, and the second statement confirms that the grommet was sploffed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
