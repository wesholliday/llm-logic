The statement \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated\" can be represented as: \"If A, then B\" (A: the flob was skizzled, B: the flob movated).\n\n2. The statement \"The flob was skizzled\" can be represented as: A (the flob was skizzled).\n\n3. If we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" (step 1) and we know that A is true (step 2), we can infer that B is also true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and the logical reasoning, we can infer that 'The flob movated'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
