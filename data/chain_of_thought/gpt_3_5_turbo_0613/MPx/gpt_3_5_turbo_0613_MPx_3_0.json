This is a conditional statement.\n\nFrom statement 2, we are given that the splat was indeed morphed.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that the condition in statement 1 is satisfied (the splat was morphed). Therefore, according to the conditional statement, we can infer that \"The splat quanked.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
