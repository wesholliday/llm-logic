It states that if the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\n\n2. \"The wug was sproinged\" - This is a statement that tells us the wug was indeed sproinged.\n\nTo infer \"It was garpled,\" we need to determine if the second statement satisfies the condition stated in the first statement. If the wug being sproinged fulfills the condition, then we can infer that it was garpled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
