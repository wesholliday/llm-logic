It states that if the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked. This means that whenever the whiffle is shanked, it will always result in the whiffle tinked.\n\nThe second statement, 'The whiffle was shanked', tells us that the whiffle was indeed shanked.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that the condition in the first statement is satisfied because the whiffle was shanked. Therefore, according to the conditional statement, it follows that 'The whiffle tinked'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
