The statement \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" is a conditional statement. It establishes a cause-and-effect relationship between the fleeg being bluttered and it surning.\n\n2. The statement \"The fleeg was bluttered\" is a premise, which means it is assumed to be true.\n\n3. Based on the first statement, if the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned. Since we know that the fleeg was bluttered (from the second statement), we can conclude that it surned.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
