This statement does not provide any information about the actual state of the wug.\n\nStatement 2 negates the possibility that the wug must be garpled. It tells us that it is not the case that the wug must be garpled, but it does not provide any information about whether the wug is sproinged or not.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The wug is sproinged.\" The statements only tell us that the wug is not required to be garpled, but they do not provide any direct information about the state of the wug being sproinged.\n\nAnswer: No",
