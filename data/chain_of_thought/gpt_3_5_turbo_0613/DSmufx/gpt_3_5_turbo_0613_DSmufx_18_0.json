This is because the statement presents a disjunction (either/or) where one of the options must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not the case that the shank must be nugged. This means that the shank is not required to be nugged.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that if the shank is not required to be nugged (as stated in statement 2), then it must be plooked (as stated in statement 1).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
