This means that if one of these possibilities is false, the other must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not the case that the sprocket must be daggled. This means that the possibility of the sprocket being daggled is false.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the only remaining possibility is that \"The sprocket is cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
