This means that at least one of these statements is true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not the case that the flugel must be zargled. In other words, we know that the flugel is not required to be zargled.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the flugel must be blimmed. This is because if the flugel is not required to be zargled (as stated in statement 2), and at least one of the two possibilities in statement 1 must be true, then the only remaining possibility is that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
