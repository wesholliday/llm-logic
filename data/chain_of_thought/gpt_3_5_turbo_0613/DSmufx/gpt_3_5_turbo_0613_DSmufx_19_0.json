In other words, it tells us that the smonk is not necessarily plagged.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that the smonk must be vreebled. This is because if one possibility (plagged) is negated, the other possibility (vreebled) becomes the only remaining option.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: yes.",
