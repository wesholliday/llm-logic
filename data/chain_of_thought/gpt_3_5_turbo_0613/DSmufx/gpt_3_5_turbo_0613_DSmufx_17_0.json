The statement \"Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled\" can be represented as \"Flob must be movated \u2228 Flob is skizzled.\"\n\n2. The statement \"It's not the case that the flob must be movated\" can be represented as \"\u00ac(Flob must be movated).\"\n\n3. To infer \"The flob is skizzled,\" we need to find a logical connection between the two statements.\n\n4. By using the rule of inference called Disjunctive Syllogism, we can conclude that if we have a disjunction (A \u2228 B) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false (\u00acA), then the other disjunct must be true (B).\n\n5. Applying Disjunctive Syllogism to the given statements, we have \"Flob must be movated \u2228 Flob is skizzled\" and \"\u00ac(Flob must be movated).\" From this, we can infer \"The flob is skizzled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
