This means that at least one of these conditions must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not the case that the twonk must be plinked. In other words, the condition \"it is plinked\" is false.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that the twonk must be varnished. This is because if the condition \"it is plinked\" is false, then the only remaining possibility is that \"the twonk must be varnished.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
