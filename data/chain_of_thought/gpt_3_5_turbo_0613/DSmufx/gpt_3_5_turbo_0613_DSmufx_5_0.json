This is because the statement says that either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled, meaning one of these two conditions must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not the case that the zinger must be smoogled. This means that the zinger cannot be smoogled.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that the zinger must be fraggled. This is because if it is not smoogled, then it must be fraggled according to statement 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
