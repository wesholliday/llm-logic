This means that at least one of these statements is true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not the case that the whiffle must be tinked. In other words, the first possibility mentioned in statement 1 is false.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the second possibility mentioned in statement 1 must be true, which is \"the whiffle is shanked.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
