The statement \"Either the wug must be bimmed or it is flooped\" can be represented as \"Bimmed(wug) \u2228 Flooped(wug)\".\n\n2. The statement \"It's not the case that the wug must be bimmed\" can be represented as \"\u00acBimmed(wug)\".\n\n3. To infer \"The wug is flooped\", we need to combine the two statements and see if we can derive it logically.\n\nUsing the rule of inference called Disjunctive Syllogism, we can conclude that if we have a disjunction (A \u2228 B) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false (\u00acA), then the other disjunct must be true (B).\n\nApplying this rule to our statements, we have:\n- \"Bimmed(wug) \u2228 Flooped(wug)\" (Either the wug must be bimmed or it is flooped)\n- \"\u00acBimmed(wug)\" (It's not the case that the wug must be bimmed)\n\nSince we know that \"\u00acBimmed(wug)\" is true, we can conclude that \"Flooped(wug)\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nAnswer: Yes",
