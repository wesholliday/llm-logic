This means that one of these two options must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not the case that the glip must be tragged. In other words, the first possibility mentioned in statement 1 is false.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the glip is slogged. This is because if the glip must be tragged and that possibility is false, then the only remaining option is that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
