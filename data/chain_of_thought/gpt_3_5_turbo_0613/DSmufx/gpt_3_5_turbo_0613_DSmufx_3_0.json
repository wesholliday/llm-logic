This means that one of these two options must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not the case that the splat must be quanked. In other words, the first possibility mentioned in statement 1 is false.\n\nGiven this information, we can conclude that the second possibility mentioned in statement 1 must be true, which is \"the splat is morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
