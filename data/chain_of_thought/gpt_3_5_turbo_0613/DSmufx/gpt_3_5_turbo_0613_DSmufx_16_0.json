It implies that one of these two options must be true.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the sneg must be sproted.\"\n   This statement negates the possibility that the sneg must be sproted. It tells us that the first option presented in statement 1 is false.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that the only remaining possibility is that \"The sneg is crampled.\" Therefore, we can infer \"The sneg is crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
