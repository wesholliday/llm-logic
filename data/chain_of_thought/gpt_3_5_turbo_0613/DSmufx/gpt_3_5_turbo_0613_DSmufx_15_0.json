The statement \"Either the dreb must be spened or it is vroombed\" can be represented as: (Dreb must be spened) OR (Dreb is vroombed).\n\n2. The statement \"It's not the case that the dreb must be spened\" can be represented as: NOT (Dreb must be spened).\n\n3. Combining the two statements, we have: NOT (Dreb must be spened) AND [(Dreb must be spened) OR (Dreb is vroombed)].\n\n4. Using De Morgan's law, we can rewrite the combined statement as: (NOT (Dreb must be spened)) AND (NOT (Dreb is vroombed)).\n\n5. From the combined statement, we can conclude that it is not the case that the dreb is vroombed, but we cannot directly infer that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: No.",
