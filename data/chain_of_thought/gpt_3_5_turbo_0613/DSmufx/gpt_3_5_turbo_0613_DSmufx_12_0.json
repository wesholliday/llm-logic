This means that one of these two options must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not the case that the smip must be lupped. In other words, the first possibility mentioned in statement 1 is false.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the smip must be shripped. This is because if one of the two possibilities must be true and we know that the first possibility (the smip must be lupped) is false, then the second possibility (the smip is shripped) must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
