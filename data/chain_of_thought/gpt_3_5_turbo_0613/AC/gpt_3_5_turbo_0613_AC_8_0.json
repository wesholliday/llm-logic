However, this does not necessarily mean that if the mummy is awake, the vampire must also be awake. The statement only establishes a one-way relationship.\n\nGiven Statement 2, which states that the mummy was awake, we cannot directly infer the state of the vampire. The vampire could be awake or asleep, as there is no information provided about its state.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: No",
