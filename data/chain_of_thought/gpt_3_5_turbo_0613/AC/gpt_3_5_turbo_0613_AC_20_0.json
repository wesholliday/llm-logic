            "content": "To determine if we can infer that the apple was red, we need to analyze the given statements. \n\nThe first statement, \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow,\" is a conditional statement. It establishes a relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana. It states that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow.\n\nThe second statement, \"The banana was yellow,\" provides information about the color of the banana.\n\nTo infer that the apple was red, we need to establish a valid logical connection between the two statements. In this case, we have the second statement confirming that the banana was indeed yellow. However, we do not have any information about the color of the apple.\n\nWithout any direct information about the color of the apple, we cannot make a valid inference that the apple was red based solely on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
