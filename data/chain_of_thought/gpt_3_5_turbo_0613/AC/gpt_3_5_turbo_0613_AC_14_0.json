It does not provide any information about the wolf being in the den independently of the bear being in the cave.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the wolf was indeed in the den. However, it does not provide any direct information about the bear's location.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot definitively infer that the bear was in the cave. The first statement only establishes a conditional relationship, and the second statement does not provide any information about the bear.\n\nAnswer: No",
