It establishes a relationship between the cake being chocolate and the muffins being blueberry. It does not provide any information about the cake if the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nThe second statement, \"The muffins were blueberry,\" tells us that the muffins were indeed blueberry.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. However, we cannot definitively infer that the cake was chocolate solely based on the given information. It is possible that the cake could be a different flavor, or there could be other factors influencing the cake's flavor that are not mentioned.\n\nAnswer: No",
