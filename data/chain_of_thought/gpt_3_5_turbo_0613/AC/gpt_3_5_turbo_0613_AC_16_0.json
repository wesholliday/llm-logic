It establishes a relationship between the shirt being cotton and the pants being denim. It does not provide any information about the pants being denim without the shirt being cotton.\n\nThe second statement, \"The pants were denim,\" tells us that the pants were indeed denim.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. However, we cannot infer that the shirt was cotton just because the pants were denim. The second statement does not provide any information about the shirt.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
