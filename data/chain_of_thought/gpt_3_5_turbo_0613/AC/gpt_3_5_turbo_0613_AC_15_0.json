It does not provide any information about whether Sam actually took a plane or not.\n\nThe second statement is \"Erin took a train.\" This statement tells us that Erin definitely took a train.\n\nBased on these two statements, we cannot directly infer that Sam took a plane. The first statement only establishes a conditional relationship, and the second statement does not provide any information about Sam's mode of transportation.\n\nAnswer: No",
