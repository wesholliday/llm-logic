It suggests that if Jeff played basketball, it would imply that Amy played tennis. \n\nThe second statement, \"Amy played tennis,\" is a separate piece of information that tells us that Amy did indeed play tennis. \n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that Amy played tennis. However, we cannot directly infer whether Jeff played basketball or not. The first statement only establishes a relationship between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis, but it does not provide any information about Jeff's actual participation in basketball. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
