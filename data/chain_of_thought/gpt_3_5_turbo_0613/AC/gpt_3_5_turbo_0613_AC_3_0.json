It suggests that if James is the author, then the book is a mystery novel.\n- Statement 2 asserts that the book is indeed a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\n- If the book is a mystery novel, it could have been written by James (according to statement 1).\n- However, statement 1 does not state that James is the only author who writes mystery novels. It only establishes a relationship between James being the author and the book being a mystery novel.\n\nBased on this analysis, we cannot definitively infer that the book was written by James. The book being a mystery novel does not necessarily mean that James is the author. Other authors could also write mystery novels. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
