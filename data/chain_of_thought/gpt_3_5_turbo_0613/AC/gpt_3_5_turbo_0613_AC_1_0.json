It states that if Mary was present at the wedding, then Sue was also present. This statement does not provide any information about whether Mary was actually at the wedding or not.\n\nThe second statement, \"Sue was at the wedding,\" tells us that Sue was indeed present at the wedding. This statement does not provide any direct information about Mary's presence at the wedding.\n\nBased on the given statements alone, we cannot infer whether Mary was at the wedding or not. The first statement only establishes a relationship between Mary and Sue, but it does not provide any information about Mary's actual presence at the wedding. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Mary was at the wedding based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
