It states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This means that if the condition (Alex finishing the race) is true, then the result (Chris finishing the race) must also be true. However, it does not tell us anything about what happens if Alex did not finish the race.\n\nThe second statement, \"Chris finished the race,\" tells us that Chris indeed finished the race. This statement does not provide any information about Alex.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot directly infer whether Alex finished the race or not. The first statement only establishes a relationship between Alex and Chris, but it does not provide any information about Alex's actual participation or completion of the race. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alex finished the race based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
