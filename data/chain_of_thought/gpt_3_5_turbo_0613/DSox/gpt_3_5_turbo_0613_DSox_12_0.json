This means that it cannot be in the state of being lupped.\n\nStatement 2 presents two possibilities: either the smip is shripped or it is lupped. Since we already know from Statement 1 that the smip is not lupped, the only remaining possibility is that the smip is shripped.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The smip is shripped.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
