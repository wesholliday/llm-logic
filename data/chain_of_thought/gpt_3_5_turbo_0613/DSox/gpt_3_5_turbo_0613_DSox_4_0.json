This means that the fribble cannot be both snurgled and crinked simultaneously.\n\nStatement 2 presents two possibilities: either the fribble is snurgled or it is crinked. However, since we already know that the fribble is not crinked (from statement 1), the only remaining possibility is that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The fribble is snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
