This means that the twonk cannot have the property of being plinked.\n\nStatement 2 presents two possibilities: either the twonk is varnished or it is plinked. Since we know from statement 1 that the twonk is not plinked, the only remaining possibility is that the twonk is varnished.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The twonk is varnished.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
