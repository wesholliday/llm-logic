This is because the second statement states that one of the possibilities is that the zinger is fraggled. Since the first statement tells us that the zinger is not smoogled, the only remaining possibility is that it is fraggled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The zinger is fraggled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
