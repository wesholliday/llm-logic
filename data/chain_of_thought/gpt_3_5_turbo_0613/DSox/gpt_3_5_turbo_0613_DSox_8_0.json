This means that it cannot be in a daggled state.\n\nStatement 2 presents two possibilities: either the sprocket is cranked or it is daggled. Since we know from statement 1 that the sprocket is not daggled, the only remaining possibility is that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The sprocket is cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
