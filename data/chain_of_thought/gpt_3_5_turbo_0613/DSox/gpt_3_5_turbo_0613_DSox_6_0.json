This means that it cannot be in the state of being plopped.\n\nStatement 2 presents two possibilities: either the grommet is sploffed or it is plopped. Since we know from statement 1 that the grommet is not plopped, the only remaining possibility is that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The grommet is sploffed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
