It does not exclude the possibility that the splat is both morphed and quanked.\n\nBased on these statements, we cannot definitively infer that \"The splat is morphed.\" The second statement allows for the possibility that the splat is quanked, and the first statement does not provide enough information to determine if the splat is morphed or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
