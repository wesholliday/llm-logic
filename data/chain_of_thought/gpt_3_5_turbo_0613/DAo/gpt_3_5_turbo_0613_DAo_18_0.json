It implies that if the doll is made of plastic, then the truck must be made of metal.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n- The doll was not plastic.\n\nFrom these deductions, we can conclude that:\n\n- The doll was not plastic, so the condition of the first statement is not met.\n- Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the material of the truck.\n\nAnswer: No",
