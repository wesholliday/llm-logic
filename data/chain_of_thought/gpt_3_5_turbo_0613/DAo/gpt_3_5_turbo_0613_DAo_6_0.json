It implies that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob would have chosen pasta.\n\nBased on these statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n- Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nFrom these deductions, we can conclude that Sue did not choose pizza, and therefore, we cannot infer anything about Bob's choice of pasta. It is possible that Bob chose pasta or did not choose pasta. The given information does not provide enough evidence to determine Bob's choice.\n\nAnswer: No",
