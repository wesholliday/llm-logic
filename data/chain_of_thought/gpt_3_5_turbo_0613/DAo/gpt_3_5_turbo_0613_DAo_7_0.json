It states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nBased on these statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n1. Alex did not finish the race.\n2. If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nIf Alex did not finish the race, then the condition in the second statement (if Alex finished the race) is false. In a conditional statement, if the condition is false, the conclusion can be either true or false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer whether Chris finished the race or not based on the given statements.",
