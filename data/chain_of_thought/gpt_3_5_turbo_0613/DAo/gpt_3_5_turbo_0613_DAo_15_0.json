It implies that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If Sam did not take a plane (as stated in the first statement), then the conditional statement in the second statement does not apply. In other words, we cannot conclude anything about Erin's mode of transportation if Sam did not take a plane.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Erin did not take a train' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
