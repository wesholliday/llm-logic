It states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was also in the forest.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If the griffin was not in the forest (as stated in the first statement), then the conditional statement in the second statement does not apply. In this case, we cannot conclude anything about the presence or absence of the unicorn in the forest.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The unicorn was not in the forest\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
