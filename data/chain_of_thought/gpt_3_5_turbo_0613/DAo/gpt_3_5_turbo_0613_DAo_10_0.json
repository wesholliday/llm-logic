It implies that if the dog was inside, then the cat cannot be outside.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that if the dog was not inside (as stated in the first statement), then we cannot determine whether the cat was outside or not. The second statement only provides information about the relationship between the dog being inside and the cat being outside, but it does not give us any direct information about the cat's location.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The cat was not outside\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
