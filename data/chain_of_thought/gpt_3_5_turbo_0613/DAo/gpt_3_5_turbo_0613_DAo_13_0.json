            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"The truck was not blue\" from the given statements, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. \"The car was not red\": This statement tells us that the car was a color other than red.\n\n2. \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\": This statement establishes a conditional relationship between the color of the car and the color of the truck. It states that if the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- Since the car was not red, we cannot determine the color of the truck based on the first statement alone.\n\n- However, the second statement provides a conditional relationship between the car and the truck. It implies that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. Since we know that the car was not red, we can conclude that the condition of the conditional statement was not met. Therefore, we can infer that the truck was not blue.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
