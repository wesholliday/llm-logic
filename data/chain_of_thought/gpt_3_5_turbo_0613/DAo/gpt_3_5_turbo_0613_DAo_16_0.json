It does not provide any direct information about the pants.\n\n2. \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" - This statement establishes a conditional relationship between the material of the shirt and the material of the pants. It states that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. However, it does not provide any information about the actual material of the shirt or the pants.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot directly infer the material of the pants. The information provided only establishes a conditional relationship between the shirt and the pants, but it does not give us any specific information about the pants themselves.\n\nAnswer: No",
