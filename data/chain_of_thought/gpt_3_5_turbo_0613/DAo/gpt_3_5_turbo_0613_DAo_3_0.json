This means that the book could have been written by someone else.\n\nFrom Statement 2, we have a conditional statement. It states that if the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. However, since we know from Statement 1 that the book was not written by James, we cannot determine whether the book is a mystery novel or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the book is not a mystery novel based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
