It does not provide any information about the color of the banana.\n\n2. \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\": This statement establishes a conditional relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana. It states that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. However, it does not provide any information about the actual color of the apple or the banana.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot directly infer the color of the banana. The information provided does not give us any conclusive evidence about the color of the banana. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The banana was not yellow\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
