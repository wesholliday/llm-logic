            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'Jen did not watch basketball' from the given statements, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. The statement 'Tom did not watch football' tells us that Tom did not watch football.\n2. The statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' establishes a conditional relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball. This means that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n- Tom did not watch football.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively determine whether Jen watched basketball or not. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if Tom watches football, but it does not provide any information about what happens if Tom does not watch football. Therefore, we cannot infer whether Jen watched basketball or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
