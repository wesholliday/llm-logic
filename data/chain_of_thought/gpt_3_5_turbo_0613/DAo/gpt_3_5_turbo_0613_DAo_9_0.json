It implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark definitely bought the blue shirt.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n- Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nFrom this information, we cannot definitively determine whether Mark bought the blue shirt or not. It is possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, which would make the conditional statement irrelevant. Therefore, we cannot infer \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
