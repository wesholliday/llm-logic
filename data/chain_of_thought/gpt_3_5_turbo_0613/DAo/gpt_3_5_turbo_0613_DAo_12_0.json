It implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nBased on these statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n- Joe did not go to the park.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively conclude whether Lucy went to the zoo or not. The second statement only establishes a conditional relationship, but it does not provide any information about whether Lucy actually went to the zoo or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Lucy did not go to the zoo' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
