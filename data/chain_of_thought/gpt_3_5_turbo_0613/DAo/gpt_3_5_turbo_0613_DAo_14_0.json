It implies that if the bear was indeed in the cave, then the wolf would be in the den.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If the bear was not in the cave (as stated in the first statement), then the conditional statement in the second statement does not apply. In other words, we cannot determine whether the wolf was in the den or not based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The wolf was not in the den\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
