This means that there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nThe conclusion states that it is not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza. This means that it is not necessary or certain that Sue chose pizza.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can see that the conclusion is a logical inference from the premise. If there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza, then it is not necessary or certain that she chose pizza.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
