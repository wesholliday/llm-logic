The argument can be represented as follows:\n\nPremise: The griffin might not have been in the forest.\nConclusion: It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest.\n\nThe argument follows a form known as denying the consequent. This form of argument is valid, and it can be represented as:\n\nIf P, then Q.\nNot Q.\nTherefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P represents \"the griffin was in the forest\" and Q represents \"the griffin must have been in the forest.\" The argument follows the denying the consequent form, where the conclusion denies the consequent (not Q) based on the premise (not P).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
