This means that there is a possibility that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nThe conclusion states 'It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race.' This means that it is not necessary or certain that Alex finished the race.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can see that the conclusion is a logical inference from the premise. If there is a possibility that Alex did not finish the race, then it is not necessary or certain that Alex finished the race.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
