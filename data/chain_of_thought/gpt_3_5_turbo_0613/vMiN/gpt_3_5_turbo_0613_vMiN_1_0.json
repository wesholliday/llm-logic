            "content": "To determine if this form of argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise states that \"Mary might not have been at the wedding.\" This means that there is a possibility that Mary was not present at the wedding.\n\nThe conclusion states \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\" This means that it is not necessary or certain that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can see that the conclusion is a logical inference from the premise. If there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding, then it is not necessary or certain that she was there.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
