It does not provide any information about the doll.\n\n2. \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\": This statement establishes a conditional relationship between the doll and the truck. It states that if the doll was made of plastic, then the truck must have been made of metal. However, it does not provide any information about the doll's actual material.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot directly infer that \"The doll was not plastic.\" The statements only provide information about the possibility of the truck not being metal and the conditional relationship between the doll and the truck. We do not have any direct information about the doll's material.\n\nAnswer: No",
