            "content": "To determine if we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, we need to analyze the given statements.\n\n1. \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\"\nThis statement suggests that there is a possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. It does not provide any information about whether Mark actually bought the blue shirt or not.\n\n2. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\"\nThis statement establishes a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. It implies that if Lisa did buy the red shirt, then it is necessary for Mark to have bought the blue shirt.\n\nBased on these statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then the conditional statement in the second statement is not satisfied. This means that Lisa did not buy the red shirt because the condition for Mark buying the blue shirt was not met.\n\n- If Mark did buy the blue shirt, then the conditional statement in the second statement is satisfied. This means that Lisa may or may not have bought the red shirt, as the condition for Mark buying the blue shirt was met.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
