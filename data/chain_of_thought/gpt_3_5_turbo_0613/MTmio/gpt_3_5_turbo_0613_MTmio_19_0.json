It does not provide any information about whether Tom watched football or not.\n\nStatement 2: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\"\nThis statement establishes a conditional relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball. It implies that if Tom watched football, it is necessary for Jen to have watched basketball. However, it does not provide any information about whether Tom actually watched football or not.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot directly infer whether Tom watched football or not. The information provided does not give us any conclusive evidence about Tom's actions.",
