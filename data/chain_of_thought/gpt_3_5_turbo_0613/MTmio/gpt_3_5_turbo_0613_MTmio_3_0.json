It does not provide any information about who the author might be.\n\nStatement 2: \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\"\nThis statement establishes a conditional relationship between the authorship and the genre of the book. It states that if James is the author, then the book must be a mystery novel. However, it does not provide any information about whether James is the actual author or not.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot directly infer that the book was not written by James. The first statement only suggests a possibility that the book might not be a mystery novel, but it does not exclude the possibility that James could still be the author. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive inference about the authorship of the book.\n\nAnswer: No",
