It means that the muffins could be blueberry, but they could also be a different flavor.\n\n2. \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry\": This statement establishes a conditional relationship between the flavor of the cake and the flavor of the muffins. It states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If the muffins might not have been blueberry, it means that there is a possibility that they were a different flavor.\n- If the cake being chocolate implies that the muffins must have been blueberry, and there is a possibility that the muffins were a different flavor, then it follows that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The cake was not chocolate.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
