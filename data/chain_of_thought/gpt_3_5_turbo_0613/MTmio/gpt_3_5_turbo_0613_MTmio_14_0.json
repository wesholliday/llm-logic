            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"The bear was not in the cave\" from the given statements, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. \"The wolf might not have been in the den\": This statement suggests that it is possible for the wolf to not be in the den. It does not provide any information about the bear or its location.\n\n2. \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den\": This statement establishes a conditional relationship between the bear being in the cave and the wolf being in the den. It implies that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf must be in the den.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If the wolf is not in the den, it does not necessarily mean that the bear is not in the cave. The first statement only suggests the possibility that the wolf might not be in the den, but it does not provide any information about the bear's location.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The bear was not in the cave\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
