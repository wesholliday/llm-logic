It does not provide a definitive answer about whether Chris finished or did not finish the race.\n\nStatement 2: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\"\nThis statement establishes a conditional relationship between Alex and Chris. It states that if Alex finished the race, then it is necessary for Chris to have also finished the race. However, it does not provide any information about whether Alex actually finished the race or not.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot directly infer whether Alex finished the race or not. The information provided does not give us any conclusive evidence about Alex's participation or completion of the race.\n\nAnswer: No",
