It does not provide any information about the color of the car.\n\n2. \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\": This statement establishes a conditional relationship between the color of the car and the color of the truck. It states that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. However, it does not provide any information about the actual color of the car or the truck.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot directly infer the color of the car. The statements only provide information about the possibility of the truck not being blue and the conditional relationship between the car being red and the truck being blue. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether the car was or was not red.\n\nAnswer: No",
