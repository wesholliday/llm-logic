This means that Sue's presence at the wedding is uncertain.\n\nStatement 2 introduces a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This means that if Mary attended the wedding, it is necessary for Sue to have also been there.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer that Mary was not at the wedding?\n\nIf Mary was at the wedding, according to statement 2, Sue must have been there as well. However, statement 1 tells us that Sue's presence is uncertain. Therefore, if Sue might not have been at the wedding, it is possible that Mary was not at the wedding either.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
