It states that if the vampire was awake, then it implies that the mummy must have been awake as well.\n\nBased on these statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If the mummy was not awake, then it is not necessary for the vampire to be awake. This is because the second statement only establishes a one-way conditional relationship. It does not state that if the mummy was not awake, then the vampire must not be awake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The vampire was not awake\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
