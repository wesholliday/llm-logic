It does not provide any information about the material of the pants.\n\n2. \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\": This statement establishes a conditional relationship between the material of the shirt and the material of the pants. It states that if the shirt was made of cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If the pants were not denim, then the shirt could be made of any material, including cotton.\n- If the pants were denim, then the shirt must have been made of cotton.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The shirt was not cotton\" from the given statements.",
