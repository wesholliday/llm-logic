            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"The apple was not red\" from the given statements, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. \"The banana might not have been yellow\": This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the banana was not yellow. It does not provide any information about the color of the apple.\n\n2. \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\": This statement establishes a conditional relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana. It states that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If the banana was not yellow (as stated in the first statement), then the condition in the second statement (\"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\") would not be satisfied. This means that the apple cannot be red.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The apple was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
