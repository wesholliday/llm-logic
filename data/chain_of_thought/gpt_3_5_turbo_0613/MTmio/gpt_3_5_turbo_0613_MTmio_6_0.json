It does not provide any information about what Bob actually chose.\n\n2. \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\": This statement establishes a conditional relationship between Sue choosing pizza and Bob choosing pasta. It implies that if Sue did choose pizza, then Bob's choice must have been pasta.\n\nBased on these statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\n- However, it is also possible that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that Sue did not choose pizza based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
