It implies that if the alien did visit Mars, then it is necessary for the robot to have visited Jupiter.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If the robot did not visit Jupiter (as stated in the first statement), then the condition in the second statement cannot be fulfilled. This means that the alien did not visit Mars because if it did, the robot would have had to visit Jupiter.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The alien did not visit Mars.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
