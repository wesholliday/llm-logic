This is because the second statement states that one of the possibilities is that the smonk is vreebled. Since the first statement tells us that the smonk is not plagged, the only remaining possibility is that it is vreebled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The smonk is vreebled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
