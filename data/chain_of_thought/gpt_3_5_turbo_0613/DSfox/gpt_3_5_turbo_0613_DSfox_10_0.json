This means that the wug cannot be described as garpled.\n\nStatement 2 presents two possibilities: either the wug is garpled or it is sproinged. Since we know from Statement 1 that the wug is not garpled, the only remaining possibility is that the wug is sproinged.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The wug is sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
