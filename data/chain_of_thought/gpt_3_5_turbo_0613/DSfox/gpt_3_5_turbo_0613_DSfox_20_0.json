This means that the first option in statement 2, \"the fleeg is surned,\" is false.\n\nIf the first option in statement 2 is false, then the second option, \"it is bluttered,\" must be true. This is because in a statement of the form \"Either A or B,\" if A is false, then B must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The fleeg is bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
