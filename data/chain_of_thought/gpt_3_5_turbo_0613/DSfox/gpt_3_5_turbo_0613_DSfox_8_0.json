This means that it is not in a certain state or condition.\n\nStatement 2 presents two possibilities: either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked. It does not exclude the possibility that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively infer that \"The sprocket is cranked\" based on these two statements alone. It is possible that the sprocket is neither daggled nor cranked.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
