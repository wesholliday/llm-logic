It does not provide any information about whether Sam actually took a plane or not.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\"\n   This statement negates the claim that Erin must have taken a train. It implies that Erin could have taken a different mode of transportation or that it is uncertain which mode she took.\n\nBased on these two statements, we cannot directly infer whether Sam took a plane or not. The given information does not provide any direct information about Sam's mode of transportation.\n\nAnswer: No",
