It does not provide any information about whether Joe actually went to the park or not.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\"\n   This statement negates the claim that Lucy must have gone to the zoo. It implies that Lucy may or may not have gone to the zoo.\n\nBased on these two statements alone, we cannot directly infer whether Joe went to the park or not. The information provided does not give us any direct information about Joe's actions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
