It implies that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\"\n   This statement negates the claim that the muffins must be blueberry. It indicates that the muffins could be a different flavor.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of these statements:\n\n- If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\n- It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nFrom these statements, we can conclude that it is possible for the cake to be chocolate and the muffins to be a flavor other than blueberry. The given statements do not provide enough information to determine the flavor of the cake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The cake was not chocolate\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
