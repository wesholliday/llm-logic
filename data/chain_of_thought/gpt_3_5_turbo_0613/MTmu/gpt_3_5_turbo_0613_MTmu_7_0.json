It implies that if Alex finished the race, then it is necessary for Chris to have also finished the race.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race.\"\n   This statement negates the claim that Chris must have finished the race. It indicates that it is not necessary for Chris to have finished the race.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If Chris did not necessarily finish the race, it means that Alex may or may not have finished the race.\n- The first statement does not provide any information about whether Alex finished the race or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty whether Alex finished the race or not based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
