It implies that if Mary was present, Sue must also have been present.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\"\n   This statement negates the assertion that Sue must have been at the wedding. It indicates that Sue's presence at the wedding is not a requirement.\n\nBased on these two statements, we cannot directly infer whether Mary was at the wedding or not. The absence of Sue's requirement does not provide any information about Mary's presence or absence. It is possible that Mary was at the wedding, but Sue was not required to be there for some other reason.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
