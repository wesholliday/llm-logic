The first statement is: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten the salad.\"\n   This statement establishes a conditional relationship between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating the salad. It does not provide any information about whether Ben actually ate pasta or not.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad.\"\n   This statement negates the claim that Kate must have eaten the salad. It implies that Kate may or may not have eaten the salad.\n\nBased on these two statements, we cannot directly infer whether Ben ate pasta or not. The given information does not provide any direct evidence or logical connection to determine Ben's pasta consumption.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
