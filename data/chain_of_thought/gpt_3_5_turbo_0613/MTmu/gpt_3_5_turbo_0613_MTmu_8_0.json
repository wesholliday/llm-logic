This is an example of a conditional statement.\n\nStatement 2 states that it is not the case that the mummy must have been awake. This can be interpreted as the negation of the statement \"the mummy must have been awake.\"\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'The vampire was not awake,' we need to consider the logical relationship between the statements.\n\nIf the mummy must have been awake (as stated in statement 1), and it is not the case that the mummy must have been awake (as stated in statement 2), then we can conclude that the mummy was not awake.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer the state of the vampire from these statements. The given statements only provide information about the relationship between the vampire and the mummy, not the individual states of each.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The vampire was not awake' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
