It implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then it is necessary for Mark to have bought the blue shirt.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\"\nThis statement negates the previous implication. It states that it is not necessary for Mark to have bought the blue shirt.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that it is not necessary for Lisa to have bought the red shirt. However, we cannot definitively infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. It is still possible that Lisa bought the red shirt, but Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
