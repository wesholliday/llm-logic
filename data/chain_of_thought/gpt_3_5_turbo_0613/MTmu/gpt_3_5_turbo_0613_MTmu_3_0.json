This is an example of a conditional statement.\n\nStatement 2 states that it is not the case that the book must be a mystery novel. This means that the book does not necessarily have to be a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The book was not written by James\"?\n\nTo answer this, we need to consider the logical relationship between the statements. The given statements do not provide any direct information about who wrote the book. The absence of the statement \"The book must be a mystery novel\" does not necessarily imply that James did not write the book. It only tells us that the book does not have to be a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The book was not written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
