This is an example of a conditional statement.\n\nFrom statement 2, we are given the negation of the second part of the conditional statement in statement 1. It states that it is not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The alien did not visit Mars,\" we need to consider the logical relationship between the statements. \n\nIf the robot must have visited Jupiter (as stated in statement 1), and it is not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter (as stated in statement 2), then we can conclude that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nHowever, the absence of the robot visiting Jupiter does not provide any information about whether the alien visited Mars or not. The robot's visit to Jupiter is not directly linked to the alien's visit to Mars.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The alien did not visit Mars\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
