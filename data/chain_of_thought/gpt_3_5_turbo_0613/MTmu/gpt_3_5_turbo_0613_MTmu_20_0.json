            "content": "To answer this question, let's break down the statements and analyze the logical reasoning:\n\n1. \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\"\n   This is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana. It states that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\"\n   This statement negates the previous statement. It says that it is not true that the banana must have been yellow.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Can we infer 'The apple was not red'?\"\n\nTo answer this, we need to determine if the negation of the second statement implies the negation of the first statement. In other words, if it is not the case that the banana must have been yellow, does it necessarily mean that the apple was not red?\n\nTo infer that the apple was not red, we would need to conclude that the first statement is false. However, the negation of the second statement does not directly contradict the first statement. It only states that it is not the case that the banana must have been yellow, but it does not provide any information about the color of the apple.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The apple was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
