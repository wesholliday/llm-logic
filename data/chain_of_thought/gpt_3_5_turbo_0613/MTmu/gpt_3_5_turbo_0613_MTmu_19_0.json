            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'Tom did not watch football' from the given statements, let's analyze the logical reasoning:\n\n1. \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\"\n   This statement establishes a conditional relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball. It implies that if Tom watched football, then it is necessary for Jen to have watched basketball.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\"\n   This statement negates the necessity of Jen watching basketball. It indicates that it is not true that Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If Jen did not watch basketball, it does not necessarily mean that Tom did not watch football. The first statement only establishes a conditionality between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball. It does not provide any information about what happens if Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Tom did not watch football' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
