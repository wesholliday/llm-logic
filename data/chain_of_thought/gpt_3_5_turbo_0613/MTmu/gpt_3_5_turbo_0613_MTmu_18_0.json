            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"The doll was not plastic\" from the given statements, let's analyze the logic:\n\n1. \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\"\n   This statement establishes a conditional relationship between the doll being plastic and the truck being metal. It implies that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\"\n   This statement negates the claim that the truck must be metal. It suggests that the truck may not necessarily be metal.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal.\n- The truck may or may not be metal.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer the statement \"The doll was not plastic\" from the given information. The second statement does not provide any information about the doll itself, only about the truck. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive conclusion about the doll's material based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
