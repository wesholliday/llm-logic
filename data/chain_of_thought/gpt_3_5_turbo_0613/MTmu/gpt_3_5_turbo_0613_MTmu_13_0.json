It implies that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\"\n   This statement negates the previous statement. It states that it is not necessary for the truck to be blue.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of these statements:\n\n- If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\n- It is not necessary for the truck to be blue.\n\nFrom these statements, we can conclude that it is possible for the car to be red without the truck being blue. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The car was not red\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
