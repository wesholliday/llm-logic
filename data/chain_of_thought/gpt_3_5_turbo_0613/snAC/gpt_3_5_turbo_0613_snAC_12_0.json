This means that whenever Joe goes to the park, Lucy always goes to the zoo.\n\nFrom statement 2, we are given the information that Lucy went to the zoo. \n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that Lucy went to the zoo, but we do not have any information about whether Joe went to the park or not. It is possible that Joe went to the park, but it is also possible that he did not. We cannot determine Joe's actions solely based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
