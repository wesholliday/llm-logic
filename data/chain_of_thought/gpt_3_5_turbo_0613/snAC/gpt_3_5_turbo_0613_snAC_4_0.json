However, this does not necessarily mean that the alien actually visited Mars. It only establishes a conditional relationship between the alien visiting Mars and the robot visiting Jupiter.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the robot visited Jupiter. This statement does not provide any direct information about the alien visiting Mars.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that 'The alien visited Mars' is true.",
