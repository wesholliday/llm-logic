We also know that the wolf was in the den (B). \n\nHowever, we cannot definitively conclude that the bear was in the cave. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if the bear is in the cave, but it does not provide any information about the actual presence of the bear in the cave. \n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
