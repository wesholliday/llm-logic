It implies that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must choose pasta.\n\n2. \"Bob chose pasta\" is true.\n   This statement tells us that Bob indeed chose pasta.\n\nBased on the given information, we know that Bob chose pasta. According to the conditional statement, if Sue chose pizza, then Bob would choose pasta. However, the statement does not provide any information about what Sue actually chose.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that Sue chose pizza. It is possible that Sue chose pizza, but it is also possible that she chose something else.",
