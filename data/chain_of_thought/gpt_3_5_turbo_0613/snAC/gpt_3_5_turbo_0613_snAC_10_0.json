It implies that whenever the dog is inside, the cat is outside.\n\n2. \"The cat was outside\" is true.\n   This statement directly states that the cat was indeed outside.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n- The cat was outside.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively conclude that the dog was inside. The first statement only establishes a one-way conditional relationship, meaning that if the dog is inside, the cat is outside, but it does not provide any information about what happens when the cat is outside. Therefore, we cannot determine the dog's location solely based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
