The statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is a conditional statement. It establishes a relationship between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis. It does not provide any information about whether Jeff actually played basketball or not.\n\n2. The statement \"Amy played tennis\" is a separate statement that tells us that Amy did indeed play tennis.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively conclude whether Jeff played basketball or not. The conditional statement only establishes a relationship between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis, but it does not provide any information about Jeff's actual participation in basketball.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
