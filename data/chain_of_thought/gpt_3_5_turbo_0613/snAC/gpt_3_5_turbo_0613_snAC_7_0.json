It states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. \n\nThe second statement, \"Chris finished the race,\" is a separate statement that tells us that Chris indeed finished the race. \n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that if the first statement is true and the second statement is true, it does necessarily follow that Alex finished the race. This is because the first statement establishes a logical connection between Alex and Chris, stating that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. Since we know that Chris finished the race, it logically implies that Alex must have also finished the race. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: Yes.",
