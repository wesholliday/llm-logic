The statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q.\" In this case, P represents \"Sam took a plane\" and Q represents \"Erin took a train.\" The given statement is true.\n\n2. The statement \"Erin took a train\" is true.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that Erin took a train. However, we cannot definitively determine whether Sam took a plane or not. The conditional statement only establishes a relationship between Sam taking a plane and Erin taking a train, but it does not provide any information about Sam's actions independently.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
