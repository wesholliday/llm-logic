Since statement 2 tells us that Sue was indeed at the wedding, it is consistent with statement 1.\n\nHowever, we cannot conclude with certainty that Mary was at the wedding based on the given information. It is possible that Mary was not at the wedding, but Sue was still there. The truth of statement 1 does not guarantee the truth of its converse.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
