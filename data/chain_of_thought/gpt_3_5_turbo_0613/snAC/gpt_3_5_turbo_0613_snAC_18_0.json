It states that if the doll is made of plastic, then the truck is made of metal. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the doll is not made of plastic.\n\n2. \"The truck was metal\" is true.\n   This statement tells us that the truck is indeed made of metal.\n\nBased on the given information, we can conclude that the truck is made of metal. However, we do not have any direct information about the doll. The statement \"The doll was plastic\" cannot be inferred from the given information alone.\n\nAnswer: No",
