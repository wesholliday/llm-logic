The statement 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest' is true.\n2. The statement 'The unicorn was in the forest' is true.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that whenever the griffin is in the forest, the unicorn is also in the forest. However, this does not tell us anything about the griffin's location when the unicorn is in the forest.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the unicorn is in the forest, but this does not provide any information about the griffin's location.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude whether the griffin was in the forest or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
