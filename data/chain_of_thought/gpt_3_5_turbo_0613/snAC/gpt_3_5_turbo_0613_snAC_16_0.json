It implies that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim.\n\n2. \"The pants were denim\" is true.\n   This statement directly states that the pants were denim.\n\nBased on the given information, we know that the pants were denim. According to the conditional statement, if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. However, the conditional statement does not provide any information about what happens if the pants are denim. It only establishes a relationship in one direction.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that 'The shirt was cotton' is true based solely on the given information.",
