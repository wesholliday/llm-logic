This statement does not provide a definitive answer about whether the whiffle was shanked or not.\n\n\"It's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked\" implies that the whiffle was not necessarily shanked. This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the whiffle was not shanked, similar to the previous statement.\n\nBased on the logical relationship between the two statements, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked\" from \"The whiffle might not have been shanked.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
