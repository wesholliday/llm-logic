This statement does not provide certainty or indicate that the clug was definitely not fleeked.\n\n\"It's not the case that the clug must have been fleeked\" implies that there is no requirement or necessity for the clug to have been fleeked. This statement does not necessarily mean that the clug was not fleeked; it simply states that it is not a mandatory condition.\n\nBased on this analysis, we cannot directly infer \"It's not the case that the clug must have been fleeked\" from \"The clug might not have been fleeked.\" The possibility that the clug was not fleeked does not necessarily imply that it was not a requirement for the clug to be fleeked. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
