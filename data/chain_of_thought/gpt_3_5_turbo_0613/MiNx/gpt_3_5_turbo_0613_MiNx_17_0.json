This means that skizzling is not a certainty.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled\" implies that it is not necessary or obligatory for the flob to have been skizzled. This means that skizzling is not a requirement.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled\" from \"The flob might not have been skizzled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
