This statement does not provide certainty or definitiveness about whether the glip was slogged or not.\n\n\"It's not the case that the glip must have been slogged\" implies that there is no necessity or requirement for the glip to have been slogged. This statement suggests that the glip could have been slogged or not, but there is no obligation for it to have been slogged.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer \"It's not the case that the glip must have been slogged\" from \"The glip might not have been slogged.\" \n\nAnswer: Yes",
