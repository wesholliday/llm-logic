This means that it is not certain whether the grommet was sploffed or not.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the grommet must have been sploffed\" implies that it is not necessary or obligatory for the grommet to have been sploffed. This means that there is a possibility that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the grommet must have been sploffed\" from \"The grommet might not have been sploffed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
