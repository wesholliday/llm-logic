This statement does not provide certainty or definitiveness about whether the wug was sproinged or not.\n\nOn the other hand, \"It's not the case that the wug must have been sproinged\" implies that there is no necessity or requirement for the wug to have been sproinged. This statement suggests that the possibility of the wug not being sproinged is open.\n\nGiven these considerations, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the wug must have been sproinged\" from \"The wug might not have been sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
