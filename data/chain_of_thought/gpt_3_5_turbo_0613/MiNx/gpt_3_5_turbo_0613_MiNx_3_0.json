This means that it is not certain whether the splat was morphed or not.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed\" implies that it is not necessary or obligatory for the splat to have been morphed. This means that there is a possibility that the splat was not morphed.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed\" from \"The splat might not have been morphed.\" Both statements convey the idea that there is a possibility that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
