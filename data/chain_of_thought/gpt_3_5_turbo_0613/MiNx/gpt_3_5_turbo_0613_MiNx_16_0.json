This means that it is not certain whether the sneg was crampled or not.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the sneg must have been crampled\" implies that it is not necessary or obligatory for the sneg to have been crampled. This means that there is a possibility that the sneg was not crampled.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the sneg must have been crampled\" from \"The sneg might not have been crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
