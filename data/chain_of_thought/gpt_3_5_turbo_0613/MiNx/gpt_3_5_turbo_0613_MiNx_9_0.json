This means that it is not certain whether the twonk was plinked or not.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the twonk must have been plinked\" implies that it is not necessary or obligatory for the twonk to have been plinked. This means that there is a possibility that the twonk was not plinked.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the twonk must have been plinked\" from the statement \"The twonk might not have been plinked.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
