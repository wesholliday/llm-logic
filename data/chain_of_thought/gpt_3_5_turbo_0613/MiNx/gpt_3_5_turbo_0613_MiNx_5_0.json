This means that fraggling is not a certainty for the zinger.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the zinger must have been fraggled\" implies that fraggling is not a requirement or necessity for the zinger. It suggests that there is a possibility that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the zinger must have been fraggled\" from \"The zinger might not have been fraggled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
