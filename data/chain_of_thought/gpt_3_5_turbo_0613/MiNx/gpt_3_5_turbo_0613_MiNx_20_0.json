This means that bluttering is not a necessary condition for the fleeg.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered\" implies that bluttering is not a requirement for the fleeg. It suggests that there is a possibility that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered\" from \"The fleeg might not have been bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
