This statement does not provide certainty or definitiveness about whether the flug was blummed or not.\n\n\"It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed\" implies that there is no necessity or requirement for the flug to have been blummed. This statement suggests that blumming the flug is not a mandatory condition.\n\nGiven these explanations, we can infer \"It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed\" from \"The flug might not have been blummed\" because the possibility of the flug not being blummed indicates that blumming is not a necessary condition. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
