This means that it is not certain whether the shank was plooked or not.\n\nTo infer the statement \"It's not the case that the shank must have been plooked,\" we need to negate the certainty of the shank being plooked. If the original statement suggests that there is a possibility that the shank was not plooked, then it implies that it is not necessary for the shank to have been plooked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the shank must have been plooked\" from the given statement \"The shank might not have been plooked.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
