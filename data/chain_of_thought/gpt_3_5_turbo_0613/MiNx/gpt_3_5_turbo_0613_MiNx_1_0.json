This means that it is not certain whether the flugel was blimmed or not.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed\" implies that it is not necessary or obligatory for the flugel to have been blimmed. This means that there is a possibility that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed\" from \"The flugel might not have been blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
