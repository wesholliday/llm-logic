This statement does not provide certainty or definitiveness about whether the sprocket was cranked or not.\n\n\"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been cranked\" implies that there is no requirement or necessity for the sprocket to have been cranked. This statement suggests that it is possible for the sprocket to remain uncranked.\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been cranked\" from \"The sprocket might not have been cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
