This statement does not provide a definitive answer about whether the smonk was vreebled or not.\n\nOn the other hand, \"It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled\" implies that it is not necessary or obligatory for the smonk to have been vreebled. This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled\" from \"The smonk might not have been vreebled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
