This statement does not provide certainty or definitiveness about whether the fribble was snurgled or not.\n\n\"It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled\" implies that there is no necessity or requirement for the fribble to have been snurgled. This statement suggests that the fribble could have been snurgled, but it is not a mandatory condition.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer \"It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled\" from \"The fribble might not have been snurgled\" because the possibility of the fribble not being snurgled aligns with the absence of a requirement for the fribble to be snurgled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
