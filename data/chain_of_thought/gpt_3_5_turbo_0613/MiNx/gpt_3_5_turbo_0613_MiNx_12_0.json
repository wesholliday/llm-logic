This means that it is not certain whether the smip was shripped or not.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the smip must have been shripped\" implies that it is not necessary or obligatory for the smip to have been shripped. This means that there is a possibility that the smip was not shripped.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the smip must have been shripped\" from \"The smip might not have been shripped.\" Both statements convey the idea that there is a possibility that the smip was not shripped.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
