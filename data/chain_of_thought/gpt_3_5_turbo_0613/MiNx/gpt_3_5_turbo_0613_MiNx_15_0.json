This means that vroombing is not a certainty for the dreb.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the dreb must have been vroombed\" implies that it is not necessary or obligatory for the dreb to have been vroombed. This means that vroombing is not a requirement for the dreb.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the dreb must have been vroombed\" from \"The dreb might not have been vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
