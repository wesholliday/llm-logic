This is an example of a conditional statement.\n\nStatement 2 negates the claim that the sprocket must have been daggled. This means that it is possible for the sprocket to not have been daggled.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The sprocket was not cranked\"?\n\nNo, we cannot directly infer that the sprocket was not cranked. The given statements do not provide any information about whether the sprocket was cranked or not. The absence of the claim that the sprocket must have been daggled does not imply anything about whether the sprocket was cranked or not.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
