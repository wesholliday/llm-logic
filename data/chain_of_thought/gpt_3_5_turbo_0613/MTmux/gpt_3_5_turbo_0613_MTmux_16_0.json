This is an example of a conditional statement.\n\nStatement 2 negates the claim that the sneg must have sproted the frink. This means that it is possible for the sneg to not have sproted the frink.\n\nNow, let's consider the original question: Can we infer \"The sneg was not crampled\"?\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot directly infer that the sneg was not crampled. The absence of the claim that the sneg must have sproted the frink does not provide any information about whether the sneg was crampled or not.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
