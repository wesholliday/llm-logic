It implies that if the splat was morphed, then it is necessary for the splat to have quanked.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the splat must have quanked.\"\n   This statement negates the necessity of the splat quanking. It indicates that the splat did not necessarily quank.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked.\n- It is not necessary for the splat to have quanked.\n\nFrom this information, we cannot definitively infer whether \"The splat was not morphed\" or \"The splat was morphed.\" The given statements do not provide enough information to determine the morphing status of the splat.\n\nAnswer: No",
