If the clug was fleeked, it implies that it must have been snugged.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the clug must have been snugged.\"\n   This statement negates the claim that the clug must have been snugged. In other words, it states that it is not necessary for the clug to have been snugged.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If the clug was fleeked, then it must have been snugged.\n- It is not necessary for the clug to have been snugged.\n\nFrom this information, we cannot definitively infer whether or not the clug was fleeked. The absence of the necessity for the clug to be snugged does not provide enough information to determine if it was fleeked or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
