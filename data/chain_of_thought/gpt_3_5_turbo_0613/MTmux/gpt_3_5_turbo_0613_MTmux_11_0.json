It implies that if the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed.\"\n   This statement negates the claim that the flug must have been zimmed. In other words, it states that it is not necessary for the flug to have been zimmed.\n\nBased on these statements, we cannot directly infer that \"The flug was not blummed.\" The reason is that the absence of the necessity for the flug to have been zimmed does not necessarily mean that the flug was not blummed. It is possible that the flug was blummed but not zimmed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
