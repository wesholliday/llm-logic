It implies that if the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the fribble must have crinked.\"\n   This statement negates the claim that the fribble must have crinked. It suggests that it is not necessarily true that the fribble crinked.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked.\n- It is not necessarily true that the fribble crinked.\n\nFrom these deductions, we cannot directly infer that \"The fribble was not snurgled.\" The given statements do not provide enough information to determine the snurgling status of the fribble.\n\nAnswer: No",
