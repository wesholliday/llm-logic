It implies that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it is necessary for it to have been surned.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned.\"\n   This statement negates the necessity of the fleeg being surned. It suggests that it is not true that the fleeg must have been surned.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements and see if we can infer \"The fleeg was not bluttered\":\n\n- If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\n- It's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned.\n\nFrom these statements, we cannot directly infer \"The fleeg was not bluttered.\" The reason is that the absence of the necessity for the fleeg to be surned does not necessarily imply anything about whether the fleeg was bluttered or not.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: No.",
