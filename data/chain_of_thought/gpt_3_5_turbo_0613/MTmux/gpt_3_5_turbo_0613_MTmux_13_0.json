It implies that if the glip was slogged, then it must have also been tragged.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the glip must have tragged.\"\n   This statement negates the claim that the glip must have been tragged. It suggests that it is not necessary for the glip to have been tragged.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If the glip was slogged, then it must have been tragged.\n- It is not necessary for the glip to have been tragged.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The glip was not slogged.\"",
