If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged. (Conditional statement)\n2. It's not the case that the smonk must have plagged. (Negation of the consequent)\n\nTo infer \"The smonk was not vreebled,\" we need to show that the negation of the antecedent is true. Let's assume the opposite and see if it leads to a contradiction:\n\nAssume: The smonk was vreebled.\n\nFrom statement 1, if the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged. But this contradicts statement 2, which says it's not the case that the smonk must have plagged.\n\nSince assuming the opposite leads to a contradiction, we can conclude that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
