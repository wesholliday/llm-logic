However, we cannot definitively conclude that the cat is napping on the couch. It is still possible that the cat is doing something other than playing in the bedroom or napping on the couch.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The cat is napping on the couch\" based on the given statements. \n\nAnswer: No",
