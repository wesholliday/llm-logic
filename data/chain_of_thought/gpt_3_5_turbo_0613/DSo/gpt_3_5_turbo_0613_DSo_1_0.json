It does not provide any information about Fido's actual location.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- Fido is not currently in the garden.\n- Fido is either inside or in the garden.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively infer that \"Fido is inside\" based on this information alone. The second statement allows for the possibility that Fido is still in the garden. Without further information, we cannot make a conclusive inference about Fido's location.\n\nAnswer: No",
