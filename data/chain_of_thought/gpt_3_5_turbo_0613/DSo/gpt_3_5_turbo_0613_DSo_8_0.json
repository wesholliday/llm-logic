It eliminates the possibility of the remote control being under the couch.\n\nStatement 2: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch.\"\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the remote control is either on the coffee table or hiding under the couch. It does not provide any information about the actual location of the remote control.\n\nCombining the two statements, we know that the remote control is not under the couch, but we don't have any direct information about its location. Therefore, we cannot infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: No",
