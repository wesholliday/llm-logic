If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged. (Conditional statement)\n2. The glip was not tragged. (Given information)\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the glip was slogged, then it was also tragged. However, we don't have any information about whether the glip was slogged or not.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the glip was not tragged. This tells us something about the glip's tragged status but doesn't provide any direct information about whether it was slogged or not.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot directly infer whether the glip was slogged or not. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
