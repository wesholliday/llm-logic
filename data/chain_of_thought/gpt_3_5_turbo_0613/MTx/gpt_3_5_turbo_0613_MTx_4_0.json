It suggests that if the fribble was snurgled, then it crinked.\n\n2. \"The fribble did not crink.\"\n   This statement tells us that the fribble did not crink.\n\nNow, let's consider the inference we can make based on this information:\n\nIf the fribble did not crink, it means that the condition mentioned in the first statement (\"If the fribble was snurgled\") did not occur. However, it does not necessarily mean that the fribble was not snurgled. There could be other reasons why the fribble did not crink.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The fribble was not snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
