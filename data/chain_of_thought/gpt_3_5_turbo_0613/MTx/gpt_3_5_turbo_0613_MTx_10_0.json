This means that whenever the wug is sproinged, it must also be garpled.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the wug was not garpled. This means that the condition required for the wug to be garpled is not met.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The wug was not sproinged\" from the given statements?\n\nSince statement 2 tells us that the wug was not garpled, and being garpled is a necessary condition for being sproinged (according to statement 1), we can conclude that the wug was not sproinged. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
