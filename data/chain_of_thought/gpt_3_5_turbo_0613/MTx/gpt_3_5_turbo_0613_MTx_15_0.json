            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"The dreb was not vroombed\" from the given statements, let's break down the logic:\n\n1. \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\" - This is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between being vroombed and being spened. It implies that if the dreb was vroombed, it must also be spened.\n\n2. \"The dreb was not spened\" - This statement tells us that the dreb was not spened.\n\nBased on these statements, we can make the following logical deductions:\n\n- If the dreb was vroombed, then it was spened (from the first statement).\n- The dreb was not spened (from the second statement).\n\nFrom these deductions, we can conclude that:\n\n- The dreb was not vroombed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
