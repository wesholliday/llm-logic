It states that if the sprocket was cranked, then it was daggled. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the sprocket was not cranked.\n\n2. \"The sprocket was not daggled.\"\n   This statement directly states that the sprocket was not daggled.\n\nBased on these statements, we cannot definitively infer that \"The sprocket was not cranked.\" The first statement only tells us what happens if the sprocket was cranked, but it does not provide any information about what happens if it was not cranked. The second statement tells us that the sprocket was not daggled, but it does not provide any information about whether it was cranked or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The sprocket was not cranked\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
