It implies that if the shank was plooked, then it must have been nugged.\n\n2. \"The shank was not nugged.\"\nThis statement tells us that the shank was not nugged.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of these statements together. If the shank was not nugged, it means that the condition required for the first statement to hold true (i.e., being nugged) is not satisfied. Therefore, we cannot conclude anything about whether the shank was plooked or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
