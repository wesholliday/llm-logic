If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked. (Conditional statement)\n2. The whiffle did not tink. (Negation of the consequent)\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the whiffle was shanked, then it tinked. However, we cannot conclude anything about the whiffle if it was not shanked.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the whiffle did not tink. This means that the consequent of the conditional statement (tinking) did not occur.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively infer whether or not the whiffle was shanked. The absence of tinking does not provide enough information to determine if the whiffle was shanked or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
