The grommet did not plop the frink.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the grommet was sploffed, then it plopped the frink. This is because the statement uses the word \"if,\" indicating a conditional relationship.\n\nHowever, statement 2 tells us that the grommet did not plop the frink. This means that the second part of the conditional statement in statement 1 is false.\n\nNow, let's consider the original question: Can we infer that the grommet was not sploffed?\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot directly infer that the grommet was not sploffed. The absence of the grommet plopping the frink does not provide any information about whether the grommet was sploffed or not.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
