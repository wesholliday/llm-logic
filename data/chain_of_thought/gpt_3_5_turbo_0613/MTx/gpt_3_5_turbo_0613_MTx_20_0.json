It implies that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it definitely surned.\n\nStatement 2: \"The fleeg did not surn.\"\nThis statement tells us that the fleeg did not surn.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of these statements together. If the fleeg did not surn, it means that the condition for surning was not met. According to statement 1, the condition for surning is being bluttered. Therefore, if the fleeg did not surn, it suggests that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer that \"The fleeg was not bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
