This is an example of a conditional statement.\n\nFrom Statement 2, we are given the information that the flob did not movate.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that \"The flob was not skizzled,\" we need to consider the logical relationship between the statements. \n\nIf the flob was skizzled, then it movated. However, we know that the flob did not movate. This means that the antecedent of the conditional statement in Statement 1 is false. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the antecedent is false, the truth value of the consequent is irrelevant. Therefore, we cannot infer whether the flob was skizzled or not based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
