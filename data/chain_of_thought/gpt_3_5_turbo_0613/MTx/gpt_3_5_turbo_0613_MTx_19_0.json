This statement establishes a conditional relationship between being vreebled and plagging.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the smonk did not plagged. This means that the smonk did not experience plagging.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The smonk was not vreebled\"?\n\nTo answer this, we need to determine if the absence of plagging implies the absence of being vreebled. \n\nIt is important to note that the absence of plagging does not necessarily mean that the smonk was not vreebled. There could be other reasons why the smonk did not plagged, unrelated to being vreebled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The smonk was not vreebled.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
