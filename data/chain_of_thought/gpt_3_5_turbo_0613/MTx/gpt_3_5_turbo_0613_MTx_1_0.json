If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled. (Conditional statement)\n2. The flugel was not zargled. (Contradictory statement)\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the flugel was blimmed, then it was zargled. However, we don't have any information about what happens if the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the flugel was not zargled. This contradicts the first statement, which says that if the flugel was blimmed, then it was zargled.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot definitively infer whether the flugel was or was not blimmed. The statements do not provide enough information to make a conclusion about the blimming status of the flugel.\n\nAnswer: No",
