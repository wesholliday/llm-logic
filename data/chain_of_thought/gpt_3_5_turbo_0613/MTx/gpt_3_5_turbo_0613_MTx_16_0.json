If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink. (Conditional statement)\n2. The sneg did not sproted the frink. (Contradictory statement)\n\nFrom statement 2, we can conclude that the sneg did not sproted the frink. This means that the antecedent of the conditional statement in statement 1 is false. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the antecedent is false, the truth value of the consequent does not affect the truth value of the conditional statement. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the sneg was crampled or not based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
