This is an example of a conditional statement, where the first part (antecedent) implies the second part (consequent).\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the splat did not quank. This contradicts the consequent of statement 1, which states that if the splat was morphed, then it quanked.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the antecedent of statement 1, \"The splat was morphed,\" is false. This is because if the antecedent were true, then the consequent would also be true, which contradicts statement 2.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The splat was not morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
