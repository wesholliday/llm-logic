This means that blumming is a necessary condition for zimming.\n\nFrom statement 2, we are told that the flug might not have been zimmed. This means that zimming is not a guaranteed condition.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively conclude whether the flug was blummed or not. The possibility remains that the flug was blummed but not zimmed, or it was neither blummed nor zimmed. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The flug was not blummed.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
