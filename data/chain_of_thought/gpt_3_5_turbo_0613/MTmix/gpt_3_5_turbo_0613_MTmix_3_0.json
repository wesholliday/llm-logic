This is a conditional statement.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that there is a possibility that the splat did not quank. This is an uncertain statement.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that if the splat did not quank, then it cannot be morphed. However, we cannot definitively say that the splat was not morphed because there is still a possibility that it quanked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The splat was not morphed\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
