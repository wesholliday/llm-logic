It implies that if the flugel was blimmed, it must have also been zargled.\n\n2. \"The flugel might not have been zargled.\"\n   This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the flugel was not zargled.\n\nBased on these statements, we cannot directly infer that \"The flugel was not blimmed.\" The reason is that the second statement only introduces a possibility that the flugel was not zargled, but it does not provide any information about whether the flugel was blimmed or not.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
