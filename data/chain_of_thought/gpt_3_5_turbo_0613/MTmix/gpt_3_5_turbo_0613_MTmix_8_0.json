This means that if the sprocket was not daggled, then it was not cranked.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the sprocket might not have been daggled. This means that there is a possibility that the sprocket was not daggled.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that it is possible that the sprocket was not cranked. However, we cannot definitively infer that the sprocket was not cranked because there is still a possibility that it was cranked but not daggled.\n\nAnswer: No",
