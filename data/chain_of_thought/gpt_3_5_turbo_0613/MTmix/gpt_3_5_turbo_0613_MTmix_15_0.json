This means that if the first statement is true, the second statement must also be true.\n\nHowever, from statement 2, we are told that the dreb might not have been spened. This means that there is a possibility that the dreb was not spened.\n\nBased on these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude whether the dreb was vroombed or not. The possibility remains that the dreb was vroombed but not spened.\n\nAnswer: No",
