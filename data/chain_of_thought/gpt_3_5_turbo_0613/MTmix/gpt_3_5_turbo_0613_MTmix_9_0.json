This statement establishes a necessary condition: plinking implies varnishing.\n\nStatement 2 introduces the possibility that the twonk might not have been varnished. This statement contradicts the necessary condition established in statement 1.\n\nBased on this analysis, we cannot definitively infer that \"The twonk was not plinked.\" The possibility remains that the twonk was plinked but not varnished, which is consistent with the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
