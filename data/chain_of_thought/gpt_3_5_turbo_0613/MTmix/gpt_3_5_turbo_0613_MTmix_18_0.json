This means that if the first statement is true, the second statement must also be true.\n\nHowever, the second statement says that the shank might not have been nugged. This means that there is a possibility that the shank was not nugged.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively infer whether the shank was plooked or not. The possibility that the shank was not nugged does not necessarily mean that it was not plooked.\n\nAnswer: No",
