The flob might not have movated.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the flob was skizzled, then it definitely movated. This is a conditional statement.\n\nFrom statement 2, we are told that the flob might not have movated. This means there is a possibility that the flob did not movate.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer that the flob was not skizzled?\n\nTo answer this, we need to consider the possibilities:\n\n1. If the flob was skizzled, then it must have movated. But we are told that the flob might not have movated. So, this possibility is not valid.\n\n2. If the flob was not skizzled, then there is no requirement for it to movate. This possibility is consistent with the given information.\n\nBased on the given information, we can infer that the flob was not skizzled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
