It implies that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it definitely was surned.\n\n2. \"It might not have been surned.\"\n   This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the fleeg was not surned.\n\nBased on these statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\n- It might not have been surned.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude that the fleeg was not bluttered. The possibility remains that the fleeg was bluttered but not surned. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The fleeg was not bluttered' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
