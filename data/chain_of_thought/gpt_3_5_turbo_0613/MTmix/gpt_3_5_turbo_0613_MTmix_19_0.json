This means that if the first statement is true, the second statement must also be true.\n\nHowever, the second statement says that the smonk might not have plagged. This means that there is a possibility that the smonk did not plag.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively infer whether the smonk was vreebled or not. The second statement does not provide enough information to contradict the first statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
