It implies that if the clug was fleeked, then it must have also been snugged.\n\n2. \"The clug might not have been snugged.\"\n   This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the clug was not snugged.\n\nBased on these statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If the clug was fleeked, then it must have been snugged.\n- There is a possibility that the clug was not snugged.\n\nFrom these deductions, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The clug was not fleeked.\" The possibility remains that the clug was fleeked but not snugged. Therefore, we cannot infer that the clug was not fleeked based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
