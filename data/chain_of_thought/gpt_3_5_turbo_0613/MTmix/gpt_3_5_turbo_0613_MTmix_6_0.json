If the grommet was sploffed, it implies that it must have plopped the frink.\n\n2. \"The grommet might not have plopped the frink.\"\n   This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the grommet did not plop the frink. It does not provide any information about whether the grommet was sploffed or not.\n\nBased on these statements, we cannot directly infer whether \"The grommet was not sploffed.\" The possibility that the grommet did not plop the frink does not provide any conclusive information about whether it was sploffed or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
