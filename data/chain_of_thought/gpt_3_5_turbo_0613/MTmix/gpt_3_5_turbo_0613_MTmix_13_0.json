This means that if the first statement is true, the second statement must also be true.\n\nHowever, statement 2 introduces uncertainty by saying that the glip might not have tragged. This means that there is a possibility that the glip did not trag.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, we cannot definitively infer that the glip was not slogged based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
