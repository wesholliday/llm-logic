This means that if the first statement is true, the second statement must also be true.\n\nHowever, the second statement says that the fribble might not have crinked. This means that there is a possibility that the fribble did not crink.\n\nBased on these two statements, we cannot definitively infer whether the fribble was snurgled or not. The possibility remains that the fribble was snurgled but did not crink.\n\nAnswer: No",
