If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked. (Conditional statement)\n2. The whiffle might not have tinked. (Negation of the consequent)\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the whiffle was shanked, then it must have tinked. This is a valid logical deduction based on the given information.\n\nHowever, statement 2 introduces uncertainty by stating that the whiffle might not have tinked. This means there is a possibility that the whiffle did not tink, even if it was shanked.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The whiffle was not shanked.\" The possibility remains that the whiffle was shanked but did not tink.\n\nAnswer: No",
