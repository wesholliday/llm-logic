This would result in: Q -> P\n\nHowever, reversing the logical relationship between P and Q is not a valid inference. Just because it's not raining hard (Q), it does not necessarily mean that it is raining (P). It could be lightly drizzling or not raining at all.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If it's raining hard, then it's not raining' from 'If it's raining, then it's not raining hard'.\n\nAnswer: No",
