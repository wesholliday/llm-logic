If the job was completed (A)\n2. Then it was not completed well (B)\n\nThe original statement can be represented as: A -> B\n\nNow, let's analyze the statement \"If the job was completed well, then it was not completed\":\n\n1. If the job was completed well (C)\n2. Then it was not completed (D)\n\nThe statement \"If the job was completed well, then it was not completed\" can be represented as: C -> D\n\nTo determine if we can infer this statement from the original statement, we need to compare the logical structures.\n\nIn the original statement, A -> B, we have the antecedent (A) being \"the job was completed\" and the consequent (B) being \"it was not completed well.\"\n\nIn the statement we want to infer, C -> D, we have the antecedent (C) being \"the job was completed well\" and the consequent (D) being \"it was not completed.\"\n\nComparing the logical structures, we can see that the antecedents (A and C) are different, and the consequents (B and D) are also different. Therefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If the job was completed well, then it was not completed\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
