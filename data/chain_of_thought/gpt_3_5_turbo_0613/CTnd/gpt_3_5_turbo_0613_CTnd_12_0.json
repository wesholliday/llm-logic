This would result in the statement:\n\nIf Q, then not P\n\nHowever, this is not the same as the original statement \"If Jane studied, then she did not study long.\" The original statement does not provide enough information to make the inference that if Jane studied long, then she did not study.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
