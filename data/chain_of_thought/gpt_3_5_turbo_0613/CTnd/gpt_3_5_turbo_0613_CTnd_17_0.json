This would result in: \nIf Q, then not P.\n\nHowever, this is not the same as the original statement. The original statement states that if the customer was greeted, then they were not greeted warmly. It does not provide any information about what happens if the customer was greeted warmly.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
