If the issue was discussed (A)\n2. Then it was not discussed in depth (B)\n\nThe original statement states that if the issue was discussed (A), then it was not discussed in depth (B). This means that if A is true, B must also be true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the inferred statement: \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed.\"\n\n1. If the issue was discussed in depth (C)\n2. Then it was not discussed (?)\n\nThe inferred statement suggests that if the issue was discussed in depth (C), then it was not discussed at all. However, this conclusion goes beyond what the original statement tells us. The original statement only tells us that if the issue was discussed, it was not discussed in depth. It does not provide any information about whether the issue was discussed at all if it was discussed in depth.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
