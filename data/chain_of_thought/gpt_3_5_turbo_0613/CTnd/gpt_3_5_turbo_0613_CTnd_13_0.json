This is known as the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of 'If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much' would be 'If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
