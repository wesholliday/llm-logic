If the room was cleaned (A)\n2. Then it was not cleaned thoroughly (B)\n\nThe original statement can be represented as: A -> B\n\nTo infer the statement \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned,\" we need to reverse the logical structure of the original statement.\n\nReversing the original statement, we get: B -> A\n\nNow, let's compare the original statement (A -> B) with the inferred statement (B -> A).\n\nIn the original statement, we have the condition \"If the room was cleaned,\" which implies that the room was indeed cleaned. However, in the inferred statement, we have the condition \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly,\" which does not necessarily imply that the room was cleaned.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
