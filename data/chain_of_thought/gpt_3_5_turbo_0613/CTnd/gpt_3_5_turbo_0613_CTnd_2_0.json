In other words, we need to change the statement from \"If P, then not Q\" to \"If Q, then not P.\"\n\nHowever, simply reversing the statement does not necessarily result in a valid inference. In this case, reversing the statement would give us \"If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise.\" But this inference is not valid because it does not follow logically from the given statement.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: No, we cannot infer \"If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise\" from the given statement.",
