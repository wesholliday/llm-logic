This means that if the issue was addressed, it was not done in an effective manner.\n\nHowever, the statement does not provide any information about what happens if the issue was addressed effectively. It only tells us that if it was addressed, it was not done effectively. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the issue was addressed effectively, it was not addressed at all.\n\nAnswer: No",
