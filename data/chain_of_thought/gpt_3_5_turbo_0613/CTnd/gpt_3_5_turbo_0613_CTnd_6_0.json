This is known as the contrapositive.\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of the original statement would be: \"If the clothes were washed properly, then they were washed.\"\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
