This would result in:\n\nQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationship between the original statement and the inferred statement:\n\n1. If I went to the store (P), then I did not buy vegetables (\u00acQ).\n2. If I bought vegetables (Q), can we conclude that I did not go to the store (\u00acP)?\n\nTo determine if the inference is valid, we can use a counterexample. Let's consider a scenario where both statements are false:\n\n1. If I went to the store (False), then I did not buy vegetables (False).\n2. If I bought vegetables (False), can we conclude that I did not go to the store (False)?\n\nIn this counterexample, both statements are false, which means the inference is not valid. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store\" from \"If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
