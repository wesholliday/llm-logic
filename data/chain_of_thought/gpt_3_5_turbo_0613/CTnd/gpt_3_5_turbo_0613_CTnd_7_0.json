This would be represented as: \"not B implies A\" (If not B, then A).\n\nHowever, reversing the logical structure of the original statement does not necessarily result in a valid inference. In this case, it is not valid to infer that if the customer was served promptly, then he was not served.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: No.",
