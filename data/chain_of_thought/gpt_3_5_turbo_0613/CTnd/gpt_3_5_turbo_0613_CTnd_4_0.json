            "content": "To determine if we can infer the statement \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study,\" we need to analyze the original statement and the logical relationship between its components.\n\nThe original statement is \"If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently.\" This statement can be represented as \"P \u2192 \u00acQ,\" where P represents \"Ben studied\" and Q represents \"Ben studied diligently.\"\n\nIn this statement, the antecedent (P) is \"Ben studied,\" and the consequent (\u00acQ) is \"he did not study diligently.\" The logical relationship between the antecedent and the consequent is that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study.\" This statement can be represented as \"Q \u2192 \u00acP,\" where Q represents \"Ben studied diligently\" and P represents \"Ben studied.\"\n\nComparing the original statement \"P \u2192 \u00acQ\" with the statement we want to infer \"Q \u2192 \u00acP,\" we can see that they have different logical structures. In the original statement, the antecedent is P, and in the inferred statement, the antecedent is Q. Similarly, the consequent in the original statement is \u00acQ, while in the inferred statement, the consequent is \u00acP.\n\nTherefore, we cannot directly infer the statement \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study\" from the original statement \"If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently.\" The logical relationship between the components is different, and the inferred statement does not follow logically from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
