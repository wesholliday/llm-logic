It implies that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry.\n\n2. \"The muffins were blueberry\" is true.\n   This statement directly states that the muffins were indeed blueberry.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry.\n- The muffins are blueberry.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively conclude that the cake is chocolate. The first statement only establishes a conditional relationship, but it does not provide any information about the actual flavor of the cake.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
