If the condition is false, then the statement \"Jeff played basketball\" cannot be concluded. \n\nSince we do not have any information about whether Jeff played basketball or not, we cannot determine if the condition (A) is true or false. \n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that Jeff played basketball. \n\nAnswer: No",
