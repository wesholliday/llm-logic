However, this does not tell us anything about the color of the apple if the banana was not yellow.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the banana was indeed yellow.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot conclude with certainty that the apple was red. It is possible that the apple was red, but it could also be another color. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
