However, this does not necessarily mean that the car was red. It is possible that the car was a different color.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the truck was blue. This information does not provide any direct evidence about the color of the car.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that 'The car was red' is true.\n\nAnswer: No",
