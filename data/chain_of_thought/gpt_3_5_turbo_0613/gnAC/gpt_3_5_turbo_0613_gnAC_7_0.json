It states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. \n\nThe second statement \"Chris finished the race\" is a separate statement that tells us that Chris indeed finished the race. \n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. However, we cannot definitively conclude that Alex finished the race based on the given information alone. It is possible that Alex did not finish the race, even though Chris did. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
