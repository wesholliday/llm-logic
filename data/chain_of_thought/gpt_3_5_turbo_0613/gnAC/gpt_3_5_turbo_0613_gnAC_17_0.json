If Ben ate pasta, then the conditional statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" would be true. In this case, both the conditional statement and the fact that \"Kate ate salad\" are true, which means that \"Ben ate pasta\" would also be true.\n\n2. If Ben did not eat pasta, then the conditional statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" would be false. However, we are given that \"Kate ate salad\" is true. In this case, the conditional statement would be false, but the fact that \"Kate ate salad\" is true does not provide any information about whether Ben ate pasta or not.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot conclude with certainty that \"Ben ate pasta\" is true. \n\nAnswer: No",
