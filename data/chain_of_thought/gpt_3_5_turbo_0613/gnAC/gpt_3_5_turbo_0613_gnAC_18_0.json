It states that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the doll is not plastic.\n\n2. \"The truck was metal\" is true.\n   This statement tells us that the truck is indeed made of metal.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal.\n- The truck is metal.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively determine the material of the doll based on this information alone. The statement \"The doll was plastic\" is not necessarily true because there is no direct information given about the doll's material.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
