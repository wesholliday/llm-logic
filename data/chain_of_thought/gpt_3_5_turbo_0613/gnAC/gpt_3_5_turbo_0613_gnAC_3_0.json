However, this does not necessarily mean that James is the only author who could have written a mystery novel. It is possible that other authors could have also written mystery novels.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the book is a mystery novel. This information alone does not provide any direct evidence about who the author is.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude with certainty that \"The book was written by James\" is necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: No",
