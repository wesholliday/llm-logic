However, it does not tell us anything about what happens if the robot visits Jupiter. \n\nGiven that Statement B is true, it tells us that the robot visited Jupiter. However, it does not provide any information about whether the alien visited Mars or not. \n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that \"the alien visited Mars\" is necessarily true. \n\nAnswer: No",
