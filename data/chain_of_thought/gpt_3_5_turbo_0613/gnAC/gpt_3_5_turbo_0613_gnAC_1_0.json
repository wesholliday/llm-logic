            "content": "To determine if it necessarily follows that Mary was at the wedding, we need to consider the logical relationship between the statements. \n\nThe statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement. It states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. \n\nThe statement \"Sue was at the wedding\" is a simple statement that asserts Sue's presence at the wedding. \n\nIf we know that the conditional statement is true and the consequent (Sue was at the wedding) is also true, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (Mary was at the wedding) is true. \n\nFor example, the conditional statement \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\" is true. If we know that the ground is wet, it does not necessarily mean that it is raining. The ground could be wet due to other reasons like watering or a spill. \n\nTherefore, based on the given information, it does not necessarily follow that Mary was at the wedding. \n\nAnswer: No",
