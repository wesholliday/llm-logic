The statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is true.\n2. The statement \"Erin took a train\" is true.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. However, this does not mean that Sam must have taken a plane. It is possible that Sam took a different mode of transportation or did not travel at all.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that Sam took a plane. \n\nAnswer: No",
