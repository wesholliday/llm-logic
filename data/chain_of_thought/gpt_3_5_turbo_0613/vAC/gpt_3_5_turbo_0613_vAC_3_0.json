            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nThe first premise states that \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"the book was written by James\" and the consequent is \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nThe second premise states that \"The book is a mystery novel.\" This aligns with the consequent of the conditional statement in the first premise.\n\nIf we assume that the premises are true, we can use modus ponens, a valid deductive argument form, to derive the conclusion. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, we can conclude that B is true.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is a conditional statement, and the second premise confirms the consequent of that conditional statement. Therefore, we can apply modus ponens and conclude that \"The book was written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
