            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This is a conditional statement, where the doll being plastic is the antecedent and the truck being metal is the consequent.\n\nThe second premise states that \"The truck was metal.\" This is a straightforward statement.\n\nThe conclusion states \"The doll was plastic.\"\n\nTo evaluate the validity of the argument, we need to check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. In this case, the argument follows the form of a valid deductive argument known as modus ponens:\n\n1. If A, then B.\n2. A.\nTherefore, B.\n\nIn our argument, the premises match the form of modus ponens:\n\n1. If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n2. The truck was metal.\nTherefore, the doll was plastic.\n\nSince the argument follows a valid deductive form, we can conclude that it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
