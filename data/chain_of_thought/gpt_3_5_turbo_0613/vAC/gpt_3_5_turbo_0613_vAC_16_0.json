            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nThe first premise states that \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"the shirt was cotton\" and the consequent is \"the pants were denim.\"\n\nThe second premise states that \"The pants were denim.\" This premise directly supports the consequent of the conditional statement in the first premise.\n\nIf we assume that both premises are true, we can use modus ponens, a valid form of deductive reasoning, to draw the conclusion. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (if-then statement) and the antecedent is true, then we can conclude that the consequent is also true.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is a conditional statement, and the second premise confirms the truth of the consequent. Therefore, we can validly conclude that \"The shirt was cotton.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
