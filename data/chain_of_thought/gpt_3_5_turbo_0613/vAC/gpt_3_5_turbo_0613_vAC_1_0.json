            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nThe first premise states that \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This is a conditional statement, and it does not provide any information about whether Mary was actually at the wedding or not. It only establishes a relationship between Mary and Sue's presence at the wedding.\n\nThe second premise states that \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This premise provides direct information about Sue's presence at the wedding.\n\nBased on these premises, we cannot definitively conclude that Mary was at the wedding. The first premise only establishes a conditional relationship, and the second premise does not provide any information about Mary's presence.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
