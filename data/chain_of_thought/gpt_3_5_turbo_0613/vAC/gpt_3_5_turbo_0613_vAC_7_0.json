This is a conditional statement, and it does not provide any information about whether Alex actually finished the race or not. It only establishes a relationship between Alex and Chris.\n\nThe second premise states that Chris finished the race is true. This premise provides information about Chris but does not directly address Alex.\n\nGiven these premises, we cannot logically conclude that Alex finished the race. The argument does not provide any direct information about Alex's performance in the race. It is possible that Alex did not finish the race, even if Chris did.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
