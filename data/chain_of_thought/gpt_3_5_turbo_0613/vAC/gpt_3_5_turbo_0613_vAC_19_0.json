            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nThe first premise states that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This can be represented as: \nIf P (Tom watched football), then Q (Jen watched basketball).\n\nThe second premise states that Jen watched basketball, which can be represented as: \nQ (Jen watched basketball).\n\nFrom these premises, we can use the rule of hypothetical syllogism, which states that if we have two conditional statements where the consequent of one statement matches the antecedent of another, we can infer a conclusion. In this case, we have:\nIf P, then Q\nQ\n\nUsing the rule of hypothetical syllogism, we can conclude:\nP (Tom watched football)\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid if the premises are true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
