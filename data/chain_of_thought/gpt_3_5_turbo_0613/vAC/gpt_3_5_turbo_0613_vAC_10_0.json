In this case, we can see that the premises do not guarantee the conclusion. The first premise only establishes a conditional relationship between the dog being inside and the cat being outside. It does not provide any information about the cat being outside or inside if the dog is not inside. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the dog was inside based solely on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
