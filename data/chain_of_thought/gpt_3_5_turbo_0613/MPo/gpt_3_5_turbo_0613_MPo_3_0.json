The second statement presents a conditional statement, stating that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel.\n\nTo infer that the book is a mystery novel, we need to establish that the first statement is true and that the second statement is valid. \n\nGiven that the first statement is true, we can conclude that the book was indeed written by James. However, we cannot determine the validity of the second statement without additional information. We do not know if the second statement is true or if it accurately represents the relationship between James and mystery novels.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the book is a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: No",
