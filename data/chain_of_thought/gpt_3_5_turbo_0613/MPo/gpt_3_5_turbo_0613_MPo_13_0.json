It states that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. \n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that if the car was indeed red, then the truck was blue. However, we do not have any information about the actual color of the car. \n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that the truck was blue. \n\nAnswer: No",
