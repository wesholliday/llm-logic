It states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. \n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that if Mary was indeed at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding as well. However, we do not have any direct information about whether Mary was actually at the wedding or not. \n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that Sue was at the wedding based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
