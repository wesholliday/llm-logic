Statement 1: \"The griffin was in the forest.\"\n2. Statement 2: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the griffin was in the forest. \n\nStatement 2 introduces a conditional statement, stating that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. \n\nSince we know that the griffin was in the forest (from statement 1), we can conclude that the condition of the conditional statement is true. \n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
