It states that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad. \n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad. However, we do not have any information about whether Ben actually ate pasta or not. \n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that Kate ate the salad based on the given statements. \n\nAnswer: No",
