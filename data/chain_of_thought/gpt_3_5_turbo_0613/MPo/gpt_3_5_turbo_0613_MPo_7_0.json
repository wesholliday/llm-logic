It states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. \n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. However, we do not have any information about whether Alex actually finished the race or not. \n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that Chris finished the race. \n\nAnswer: No",
