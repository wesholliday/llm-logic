The second statement is \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\"\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If the dog was inside (as stated in the first statement), then the cat was outside (as stated in the second statement).\n- Since the first statement tells us that the dog was inside, we can infer that the cat was outside based on the second statement.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
