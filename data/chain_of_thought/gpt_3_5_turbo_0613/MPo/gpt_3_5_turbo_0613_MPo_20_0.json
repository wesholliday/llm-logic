This means that the color of the banana is dependent on the color of the apple.\n\nBased on the given information, we can infer that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. However, we do not have any direct information about the color of the apple, so we cannot definitively conclude that the banana was yellow.\n\nAnswer: No",
