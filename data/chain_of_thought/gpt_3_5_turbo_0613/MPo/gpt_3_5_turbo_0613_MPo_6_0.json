However, we cannot directly infer that Bob chose pasta. The second statement only establishes a conditional relationship between Sue choosing pizza and Bob choosing pasta. It does not provide any information about whether or not Bob actually chose pasta.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that Bob chose pasta based on the given statements.",
