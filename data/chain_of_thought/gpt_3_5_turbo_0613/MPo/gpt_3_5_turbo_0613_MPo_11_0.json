However, we do not have any information about the actual flavor of the muffins. It is possible that the muffins were blueberry, but it is also possible that they were a different flavor. \n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The muffins were blueberry\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
