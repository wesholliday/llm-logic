This is a standalone statement and does not provide any information about Lucy.\n\nStatement 2 is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo. It states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. However, it does not provide any information about whether Joe actually went to the park or not.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot directly infer whether Lucy went to the zoo or not. The second statement only establishes a conditional relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo, but it does not provide any information about Joe's actual visit to the park.\n\nAnswer: No",
