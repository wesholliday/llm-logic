The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of the given statement would be \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\nTherefore, the statement \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" is not the contrapositive of the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
