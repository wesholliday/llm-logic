            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball\" from the statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball,\" we need to analyze the logical structure of the statement.\n\nThe original statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\" In this case, A represents \"Tom watched football\" and B represents \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nWhen we negate a conditional statement, the negation of \"If A, then B\" is \"If A, then not B.\" In this case, the negation of \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" would be \"If Tom watched football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\"\n\nHowever, the question is asking if we can infer the statement \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball\" from the original statement. To determine this, we need to consider whether the negation of the original statement is equivalent to the statement in question.\n\nIn this case, the negation of the original statement is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\" This is not equivalent to the statement \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\" The original statement only tells us about the relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball, but it does not provide information about what happens if Tom does not watch football.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
