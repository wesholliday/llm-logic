In general, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the contrapositive of the original statement would be \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\nComparing the contrapositive to the inference we are trying to make, we can see that they are not the same. The contrapositive states that if Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park. However, the inference we are trying to make states that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo\" from \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
