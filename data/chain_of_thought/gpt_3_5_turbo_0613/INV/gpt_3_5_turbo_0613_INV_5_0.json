            "content": "To determine if we can infer the statement \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis\" from the given statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis,\" we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe original statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\" In this case, A represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and B represents \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nThe inverse of a conditional statement switches the positions of the hypothesis and conclusion and negates both. So, the inverse of the original statement would be \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\"\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the inverse of a conditional statement is not always logically equivalent to the original statement. In this case, the inverse statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis\" from the given statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
