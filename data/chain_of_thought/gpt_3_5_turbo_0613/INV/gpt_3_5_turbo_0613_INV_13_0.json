            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue\" from \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\", we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe original statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement in the form of \"If A, then B\". In this case, A represents the car being red, and B represents the truck being blue.\n\nThe negation of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If A is not true, then B is not necessarily true\". This means that if the car is not red, it does not necessarily mean that the truck is not blue.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue\" from \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\".\n\nAnswer: No",
