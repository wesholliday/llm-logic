            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding' from 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statement.\n\nThe original statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement in the form of \"If A, then B\". In this case, A represents the proposition \"Mary was at the wedding\" and B represents the proposition \"Sue was at the wedding\".\n\nIn a conditional statement, the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. Therefore, the contrapositive of the original statement would be 'If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding'.\n\nHowever, the contrapositive does not necessarily imply the original statement. In this case, the contrapositive 'If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding' does not provide any new information or logical inference. It is possible for Mary not to be at the wedding while Sue is still at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
