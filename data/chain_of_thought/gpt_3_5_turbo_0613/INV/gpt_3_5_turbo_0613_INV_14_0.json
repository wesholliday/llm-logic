If the original statement is true, then we can infer the inverse. However, if the original statement is false, we cannot infer the inverse.\n\nWithout knowing the truth value of the original statement, we cannot determine if we can infer \"If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den\" from \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
