            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside\" from \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside,\" we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe original statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" can be represented as:\n\nP: The dog was inside\nQ: The cat was outside\n\nSo the original statement can be written as \"If P, then Q.\"\n\nTo infer the statement \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside,\" we need to negate both P and Q. The negation of P is \"The dog was not inside,\" and the negation of Q is \"The cat was not outside.\"\n\nSo the inferred statement can be written as \"If not P, then not Q.\"\n\nTo determine if the inferred statement is valid, we need to consider the logical relationship between the original statement and the inferred statement. In this case, the inferred statement is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always true if the original statement is true. So, if the original statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" is true, then the inferred statement \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
