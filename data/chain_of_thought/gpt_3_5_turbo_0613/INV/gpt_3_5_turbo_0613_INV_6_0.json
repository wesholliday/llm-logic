The contrapositive of a conditional statement switches the hypothesis and conclusion and negates both.\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement is: \nNot Bob chose pasta -> Not Sue chose pizza\n\nTherefore, based on the contrapositive, we can infer that \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
