This would result in:\n\nR: If the smip lupped the zoint\nS: then the smip was not shripped\n\nSo, the inferred statement can be written as \"If R, then S.\"\n\nTo determine if the inferred statement is valid, we need to check if it follows the same logical structure as the given statement. In this case, the inferred statement has the same structure as the given statement, but with the conditions reversed.\n\nTherefore, the inferred statement \"If the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was not shripped\" can be inferred from the given statement \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
