In this case, A represents \"the zinger was fraggled\" and B represents \"the zinger was not smoogled\".\n\nTo infer the statement 'If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled', we need to reverse the conditional statement. This is known as the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. In this case, not B represents \"the zinger was smoogled\" and not A represents \"the zinger was not fraggled\".\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of the original statement is 'If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
