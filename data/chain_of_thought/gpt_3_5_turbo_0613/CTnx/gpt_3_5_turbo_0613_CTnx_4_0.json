This would be represented as:\n\nR: The fribble crink\nS: The fribble was not snurgled\n\nSo the inferred statement would be \"If R, then S.\"\n\nTo determine if the inferred statement is valid, we need to check if it follows the same logical structure as the original statement. In this case, the inferred statement is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nComparing the contrapositive (\"If not Q, then not P\") to the inferred statement (\"If R, then S\"), we can see that they have the same logical structure.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled\" from \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble did not crink.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
