This would result in \"If Q, then P\" or Q \u2192 P.\n\nTo determine if we can infer Q \u2192 P from P \u2192 Q, we can use the contrapositive rule. The contrapositive of P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was not garpled\" would be \"If the wug was garpled, then it was sproinged.\"\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the wug was garpled, then the wug was not sproinged\" from \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was not garpled.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
