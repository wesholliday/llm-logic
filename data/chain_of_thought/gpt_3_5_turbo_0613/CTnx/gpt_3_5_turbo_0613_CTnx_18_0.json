This can be done by applying the contrapositive rule, which states that if a conditional statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement is:\n\nNot not nugged -> Not plooked\n\nSimplifying the double negation, we get:\n\nNugged -> Not plooked\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
