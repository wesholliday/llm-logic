This would result in:\n\nIf B, then not A.\n\nHowever, this is not the same as the given statement. In the given statement, the condition \"the grommet did not plop the frink\" is negated, but in the inferred statement, the condition \"the grommet was not sploffed\" is negated.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed\" from the given statement. \n\nAnswer: No",
