This would result in: \"If Q, then not P\" (If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered).\n\nNow, let's compare the two statements:\n\n1. If P, then not Q (If the fleeg was bluttered, then it did not surn).\n2. If Q, then not P (If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered).\n\nBy comparing the two statements, we can see that they have a different logical structure. The first statement states that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it did not surn. However, the second statement suggests that if the fleeg surned, then it was not bluttered.\n\nSince the logical structure of the two statements is different, we cannot directly infer the second statement from the first. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
