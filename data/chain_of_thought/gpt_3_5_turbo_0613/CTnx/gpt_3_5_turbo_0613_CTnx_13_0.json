If A being true guarantees that B is false, then we can infer the statement \"If B, then not A.\"\n\nHowever, if A being true does not guarantee that B is false, then we cannot infer the statement \"If B, then not A.\"\n\nIn this case, the given statement \"If A, then not B\" does not provide any information about the relationship between B and A. It only tells us that if A is true, then B must be false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If the glip was tragged, then the glip was not slogged\" from the given statement \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was not tragged.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
