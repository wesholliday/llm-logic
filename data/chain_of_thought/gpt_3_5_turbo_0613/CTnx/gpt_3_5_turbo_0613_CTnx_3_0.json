In other words, we need to check if \"If R, then S\" is equivalent to \"If P, then Q.\"\n\nIn this case, the proposed inference is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nSo, the contrapositive of the original statement is \"If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
