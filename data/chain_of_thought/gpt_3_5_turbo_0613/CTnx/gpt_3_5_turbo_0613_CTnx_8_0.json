In other words, we need to determine if the contrapositive of the original statement is true.\n\nThe contrapositive of 'Cranked -> Not Daggled' is 'Daggled -> Not Cranked'.\n\nTo determine if the contrapositive is true, we need to consider if the original statement is true. If the original statement is true, then the contrapositive will also be true.\n\nWithout any additional information about the relationship between cranked and daggled, we cannot determine if the original statement is true. Therefore, we cannot infer the statement 'If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
