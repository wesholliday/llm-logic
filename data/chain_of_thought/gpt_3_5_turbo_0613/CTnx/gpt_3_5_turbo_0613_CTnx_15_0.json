This would result in:\nIf B, then not A.\n\nHowever, this is not the same as the original statement. In the original statement, the condition \"If the dreb was vroombed\" is followed by the consequence \"then the dreb was not spened\". In the inferred statement, the condition \"If the dreb was spened\" is followed by the consequence \"then the dreb was not vroombed\".\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\" from the given statement \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was not spened\".\n\nAnswer: No",
