This would result in:\nIf B, then not A.\n\nHowever, this is not a valid inference. The original statement does not provide any information about what happens if the flob movates. It only tells us what happens if the flob is skizzled. Therefore, we cannot infer the statement 'If the flob movated, then the flob was not skizzled' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
