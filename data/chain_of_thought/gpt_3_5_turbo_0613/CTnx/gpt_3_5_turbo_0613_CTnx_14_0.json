This can be represented as:\n\nR: The clug snugged.\nS: The clug was not fleeked.\n\nThe inferred statement can be written as \"If R, then S.\"\n\nTo determine if the inference is valid, we need to check if the original statement and the inferred statement have the same logical structure. In this case, the original statement is \"If P, then not Q,\" and the inferred statement is \"If R, then S.\"\n\nBy comparing the two statements, we can see that they have the same logical structure. The only difference is the substitution of P and Q with R and S. Therefore, we can infer \"If the clug snugged, then the clug was not fleeked\" from \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug did not snugged.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
