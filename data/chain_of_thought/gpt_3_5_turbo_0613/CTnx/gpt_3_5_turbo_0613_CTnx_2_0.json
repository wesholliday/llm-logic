This can be done by applying the contrapositive rule, which states that if we have a statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" the contrapositive is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement is:\n\nBimmed -> Not flooped\n\nNow, we can compare the contrapositive with the statement we want to infer:\n\nBimmed -> Not flooped\n\nThe contrapositive matches the statement we want to infer, which means we can indeed infer \"If the wug bimmed the zoint, then the wug was not flooped\" from \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
