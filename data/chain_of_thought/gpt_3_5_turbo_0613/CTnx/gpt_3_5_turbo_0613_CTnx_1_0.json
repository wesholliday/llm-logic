In this case, P represents the flugel being blimmed, and Q represents the flugel not being zargled.\n\nTo infer the statement 'If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed', we need to reverse the conditional statement. This is known as the contrapositive.\n\nThe contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. In this case, not Q represents the flugel being zargled, and not P represents the flugel not being blimmed.\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of the original statement is 'If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
