Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Mary was present at the wedding, then Sue must have also been present. However, statement 2 tells us that Mary was not at the wedding. \n\nBased on this information, we cannot make any definitive inference about whether Sue was at the wedding or not. It is possible that Sue was at the wedding even though Mary was not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No",
