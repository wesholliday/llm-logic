The vampire was not awake.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake. However, statement 2 tells us that the vampire is not awake. \n\nSince the vampire is not awake, we cannot make any conclusions about the state of the mummy. The mummy could be awake or not awake, as there is no information given about its state independent of the vampire.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer whether the mummy was awake or not based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
