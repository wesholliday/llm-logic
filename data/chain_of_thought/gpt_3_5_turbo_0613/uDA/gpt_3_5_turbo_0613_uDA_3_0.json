The book was not written by James.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if James is the author, then the book is a mystery novel. However, statement 2 tells us that James is not the author.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot make a definitive inference about whether the book is a mystery novel or not. The reason is that statement 2 does not provide any information about the actual author of the book. It is possible that the book was written by someone other than James and is still a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: No",
