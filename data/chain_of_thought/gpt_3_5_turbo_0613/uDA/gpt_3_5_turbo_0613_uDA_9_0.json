Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Mark bought the blue shirt because the first statement is conditional. It only tells us what happens if Lisa bought the red shirt, but it does not provide any information about what happens if Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer whether Mark bought the blue shirt or not based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
