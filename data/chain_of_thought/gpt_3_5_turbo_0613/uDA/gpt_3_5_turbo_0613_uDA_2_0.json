The griffin was not in the forest.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the griffin is not in the forest, then the unicorn may or may not be in the forest. This is because the statement only establishes a condition for when the griffin is in the forest.\n\nFrom statement 2, we are given the information that the griffin was not in the forest. This means that the condition for the unicorn being in the forest (as stated in statement 1) is not met.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can infer that the unicorn was not necessarily in the forest. However, we cannot definitively conclude that the unicorn was not in the forest, as there may be other conditions or factors that determine the unicorn's presence in the forest. \n\nAnswer: No",
