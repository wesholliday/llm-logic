The shirt was not cotton.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim. However, we are told in statement 2 that the shirt is not cotton. \n\nSince we know that the shirt is not cotton, we cannot make any conclusions about the pants because the first statement only applies when the shirt is cotton. Therefore, we cannot infer whether the pants were denim or not based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
