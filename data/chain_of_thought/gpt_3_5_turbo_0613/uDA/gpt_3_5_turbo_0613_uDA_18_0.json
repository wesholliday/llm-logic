However, we are not given any information about what happens if the doll was not plastic.\n\nFrom statement 2, we are told that the doll was not plastic. This means that we cannot conclude anything about the material of the truck based on this statement alone.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer whether the truck was or was not metal based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
