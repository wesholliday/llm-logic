Alex did not finish the race.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. However, we are given that Alex did not finish the race (statement 2). \n\nBased on this information, we cannot make a definite inference about whether Chris finished the race or not. It is possible that Chris finished the race even though Alex did not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: No",
