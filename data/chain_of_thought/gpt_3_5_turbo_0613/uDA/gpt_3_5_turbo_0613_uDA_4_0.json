The alien did not visit Mars.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the alien did visit Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. However, we are given in statement 2 that the alien did not visit Mars. \n\nSince we know that the alien did not visit Mars, we cannot make any conclusions about whether the robot visited Jupiter or not. The robot's visit to Jupiter is not dependent on the alien's visit to Mars, according to the information given. Therefore, we cannot infer whether the robot visited Jupiter or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
