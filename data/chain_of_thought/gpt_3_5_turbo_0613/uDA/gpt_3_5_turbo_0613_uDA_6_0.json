Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. However, statement 2 tells us that Sue did not choose pizza. \n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively infer whether Bob chose pasta or not. It is possible that Bob still chose pasta, as there is no information given about Bob's choice. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: No",
