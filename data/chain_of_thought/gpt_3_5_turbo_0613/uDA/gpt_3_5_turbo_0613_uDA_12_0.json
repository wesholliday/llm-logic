Joe did not go to the park.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Joe went to the park, Lucy went to the zoo. However, statement 2 tells us that Joe did not go to the park. \n\nSince we know that Joe did not go to the park, we cannot make any conclusions about whether Lucy went to the zoo or not. It is possible that Lucy still went to the zoo even though Joe did not go to the park. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
