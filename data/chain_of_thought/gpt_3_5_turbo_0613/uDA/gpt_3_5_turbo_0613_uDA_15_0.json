Sam did not take a plane.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Sam took a plane, Erin took a train. However, statement 2 tells us that Sam did not take a plane. \n\nBased on this information, we cannot make any definitive inference about whether Erin took a train or not. It is possible that Erin still took a train, even though Sam did not take a plane. There could be other modes of transportation that Erin could have used. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Erin did not take a train.\n\nAnswer: No",
