The dog was not inside.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. However, statement 2 tells us that the dog was not inside. \n\nSince we know that the dog was not inside, we cannot make any conclusions about the cat's location based on the given information. The cat could be either inside or outside, as we don't have any information about its location.\n\nAnswer: No",
