It implies that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy definitely played tennis.\n\n2. \"Amy did not play tennis.\"\nThis statement tells us that Amy did not play tennis.\n\nBased on these statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n- Amy did not play tennis.\n\nFrom these deductions, we can conclude that Jeff did not play basketball.
