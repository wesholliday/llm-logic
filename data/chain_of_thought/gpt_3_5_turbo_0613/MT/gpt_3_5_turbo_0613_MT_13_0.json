It implies that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue.\n\n2. \"The truck was not blue\": This statement tells us that the truck was not blue.\n\nBased on these statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If the truck was not blue, it means that the condition in the first statement (\"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\") was not met. This means that the car was not red.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The car was not red' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
