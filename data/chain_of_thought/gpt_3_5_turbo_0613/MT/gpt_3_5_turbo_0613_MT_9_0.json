            "content": "To determine if we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, we need to analyze the given statements logically.\n\n1. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\nThis statement establishes a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. It implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark definitely bought the blue shirt.\n\n2. \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\nThis statement tells us that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nBased on these statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n- Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nFrom these deductions, we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This is because the first statement establishes a direct relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. Since Mark did not buy the blue shirt, it means that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
