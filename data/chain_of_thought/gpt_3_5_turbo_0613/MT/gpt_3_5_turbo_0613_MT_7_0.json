However, we cannot directly infer anything about Alex from this information alone. It is possible that Alex finished the race or did not finish the race.\n\nThe first statement establishes a conditional relationship between Alex and Chris. It states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if Alex did not finish the race.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer whether Alex finished the race or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
