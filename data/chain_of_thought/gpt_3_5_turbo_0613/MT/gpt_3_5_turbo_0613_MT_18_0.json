It states that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the doll is not plastic.\n\n2. \"The truck was not metal.\"\n   This statement tells us that the truck was not metal. It does not provide any information about the doll.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot directly infer that \"The doll was not plastic.\" The statements only provide information about the truck, not the doll. The doll could be plastic or not plastic, and we do not have enough information to make a conclusion about its material.\n\nAnswer: No",
