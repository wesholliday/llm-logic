It does not provide any information about whether Sam actually took a plane or Erin actually took a train.\n\n2. \"Erin did not take a train.\"\nThis statement tells us that Erin did not take a train. It does not provide any information about whether Sam took a plane or not.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot directly infer whether Sam took a plane or not. The information provided does not give us any conclusive evidence about Sam's mode of transportation.\n\nAnswer: No",
