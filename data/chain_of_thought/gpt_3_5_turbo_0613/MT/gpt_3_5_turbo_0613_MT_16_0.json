            "content": "To determine if we can infer that the shirt was not cotton, we need to analyze the given statements logically.\n\n1. \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\"\nThis statement establishes a conditional relationship between the shirt being cotton and the pants being denim. It implies that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim.\n\n2. \"The pants were not denim.\"\nThis statement tells us that the pants were not denim.\n\nBased on these statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If the pants were not denim, it means that the condition in the first statement (\"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\") is not satisfied. In other words, the antecedent of the conditional statement is false.\n\n- When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the truth value of the consequent is irrelevant. Therefore, we cannot determine the truth value of the consequent (\"The shirt was cotton\") based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The shirt was not cotton\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
