It implies that whenever the dog is inside, the cat must be outside.\n\n2. \"The cat was not outside\": This statement tells us that the cat was not outside.\n\nBased on these statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If the cat was not outside, it means that the cat was inside.\n- However, we cannot directly conclude that the dog was inside based on this information alone.\n\nThe given statements do not provide any information about the dog's location. It is possible that the dog was inside or outside, as the statements only establish a relationship between the dog being inside and the cat being outside. Therefore, we cannot infer that the dog was inside based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
