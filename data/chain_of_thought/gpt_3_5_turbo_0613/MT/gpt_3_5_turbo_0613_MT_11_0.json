            "content": "To determine if we can infer that the cake was not chocolate, we need to analyze the given statements logically.\n\n1. \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\"\nThis statement establishes a conditional relationship between the cake being chocolate and the muffins being blueberry. It implies that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry.\n\n2. \"The muffins were not blueberry.\"\nThis statement tells us that the muffins were not blueberry. It contradicts the first statement, which states that if the cake is chocolate, the muffins must be blueberry.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can infer that the cake cannot be chocolate. If the cake were chocolate, it would imply that the muffins were blueberry, which contradicts the second statement that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
