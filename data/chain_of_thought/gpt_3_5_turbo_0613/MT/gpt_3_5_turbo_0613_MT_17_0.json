It implies that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate definitely ate the salad.\n\n2. \"Kate did not eat the salad\": This statement tells us that Kate did not eat the salad.\n\nBased on these statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If Kate did not eat the salad, it means that the condition in the first statement (\"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\") is not satisfied. This means that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
