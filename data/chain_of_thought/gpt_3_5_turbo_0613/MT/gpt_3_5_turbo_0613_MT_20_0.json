The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" implies that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow. This is a conditional statement.\n\n2. The statement \"The banana was not yellow\" tells us that the banana was not yellow. This is a negation of a statement.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of these statements:\n\n- If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n- The banana was not yellow.\n\nFrom these statements, we cannot directly infer that \"The apple was not red.\" The reason is that the first statement is a conditional statement, and the second statement is a negation of a statement. We cannot conclude anything about the color of the apple based solely on the information given.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
