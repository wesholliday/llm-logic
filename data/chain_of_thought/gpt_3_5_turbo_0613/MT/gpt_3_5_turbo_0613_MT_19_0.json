            "content": "To determine if we can infer that Tom did not watch football, we need to analyze the given statements logically.\n\nThe first statement is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This statement establishes a conditional relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball. It implies that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nThe second statement is \"Jen did not watch basketball.\" This statement tells us that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that Jen did not watch basketball. However, we cannot directly infer whether Tom watched football or not. The first statement only establishes a conditional relationship, and it does not provide any information about whether Tom actually watched football.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
