It states that if Mary was present at the wedding, then Sue must also be present.\n\n2. \"Sue was not at the wedding.\"\nThis statement directly tells us that Sue was not present at the wedding.\n\nBased on these statements, we can make the following logical deductions:\n\n- If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n- Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nFrom these deductions, we can conclude that Mary cannot be at the wedding. If Mary were at the wedding, it would contradict the second statement that Sue was not present. Therefore, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
