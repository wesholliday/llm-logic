It does not provide any information about whether Joe actually went to the park or not.\n\n2. \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\"\nThis statement tells us that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nBased on these statements, we cannot directly infer whether Joe went to the park or not. The first statement only establishes a conditional relationship, and the second statement only provides information about Lucy not going to the zoo. It is possible that Joe went to the park, but it is also possible that he did not.\n\nAnswer: No",
