It implies that if James wrote the book, then it must be a mystery novel.\n\n2. \"The book is not a mystery novel.\"\nThis statement contradicts the condition established in the first statement. It states that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer the following:\n\n- If the book is a mystery novel, then it was written by James (based on the first statement).\n- However, we know that the book is not a mystery novel (based on the second statement).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
