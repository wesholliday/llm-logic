This means that it is possible for the fribble to be snurgled instead.\n\nStatement 2 presents two possibilities: either the fribble must be crinked or it is snurgled. Since we know from statement 1 that the fribble does not have to be crinked, the only remaining possibility is that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The fribble is snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
