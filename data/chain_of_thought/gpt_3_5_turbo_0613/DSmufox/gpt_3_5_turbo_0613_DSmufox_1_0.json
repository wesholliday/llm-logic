This means that the flugel can either be zargled or not zargled.\n\nStatement 2 presents two possibilities: either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed. Since we know from statement 1 that the flugel does not necessarily have to be zargled, it leaves us with the possibility that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The flugel is blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
