This means that it could be either garpled or not garpled.\n\nStatement 2 presents two possibilities: either the wug must be garpled or it is sproinged. Since we know from statement 1 that the wug is not necessarily garpled, it must be sproinged.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The wug is sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
