In this case, the conclusion is an extension of the original premise by adding the condition \"the check bounces\" to the antecedent.\n\nSince the conclusion is an extension of the original premise, and it follows the same logical structure, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
