Let's represent this premise as P.\n\nThe conclusion states that if you fill up the gas tank and there is a hole in it, the car will run. Let's represent this conclusion as Q.\n\nThe argument can be represented as: P \u2192 Q.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. In other words, we need to check if the argument is in a valid logical form.\n\nIn this case, the argument is not logically valid. The conclusion \"If you fill up the gas tank and there is a hole in it, the car will run\" does not necessarily follow from the premise \"If you fill up the gas tank, the car will run.\" The presence of a hole in the gas tank could potentially prevent the car from running, even if the tank is filled.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
