In this case, the conclusion adds an extra condition (the pilot light being out) to the original premise. \n\nIf the pilot light being out is a necessary condition for the kitchen to be warm when the oven is on, then the argument is logically valid. However, if the pilot light being out is not necessary for the kitchen to be warm when the oven is on, then the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: It is not possible to determine the logical validity of the argument without additional information.",
