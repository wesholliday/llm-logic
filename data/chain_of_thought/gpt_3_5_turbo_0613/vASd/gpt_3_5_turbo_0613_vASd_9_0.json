            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument. \n\nThe premise states: \"If the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A.\" This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"the essay is well-written\" and the consequent is \"the student will get an A.\"\n\nThe conclusion states: \"If the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A.\" This is also a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"the essay is well-written and turned in late\" and the consequent is \"the student will get an A.\"\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In this case, the conclusion does follow logically from the premise because it is an extension of the original conditional statement. If the premise is true, and the essay being well-written guarantees an A, then it logically follows that if the essay is well-written and turned in late, the student will still get an A.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
