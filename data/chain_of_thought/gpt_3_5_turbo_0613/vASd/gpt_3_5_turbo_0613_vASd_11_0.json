In this case, the conclusion is a combination of the original premise and an additional condition (doing hard labor).\n\nBy examining the logical structure, we can see that the argument is valid. The conclusion is a valid deduction from the premise because it combines the original condition (getting enough sleep) with an additional condition (doing hard labor) to reach the same conclusion (not being tired).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
