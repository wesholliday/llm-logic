In this case, the conclusion does not follow logically from the premise. The original premise only states the condition for the lawn to be lush and green is fertilization, but it does not mention anything about a drought. Therefore, the conclusion that includes both fertilization and a drought as conditions for the lawn to be lush and green is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
