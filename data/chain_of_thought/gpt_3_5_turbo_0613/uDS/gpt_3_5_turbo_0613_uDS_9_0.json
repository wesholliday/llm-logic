The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the missing puzzle piece is either in the box or on the floor. However, statement 2 tells us that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor. \n\nIf the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor, then it must be in the box. This is because the only two possibilities given are the box or the floor, and we have ruled out the floor as an option.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
