    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a blimfet, a crongle, and a narzil are the leading bafwidgers. Experts expect the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most this year, followed by the crongle, with the narzil bafwidging much less. These are the only major bafwidgers, so if the crongle doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, then if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will bafwidge the most. Moreover, the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most, and hence the crongle likely won\u2019t bafwidge the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will?",

Experts expect the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most this year, followed by the crongle, with the narzil bafwidging much less.\n2. These are the only major bafwidgers.\n3. If the crongle doesn't bafwidge the most, then if the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, the narzil will bafwidge the most.\n4. Moreover, the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most, and hence the crongle likely won't bafwidge the most.\n\nBased on the given information, we can conclude the following:\n- The blimfet is expected to bafwidge the most.\n- The crongle is expected to bafwidge less than the blimfet.\n- The narzil is expected to bafwidge even less than the crongle.\n- If the crongle doesn't bafwidge the most, and the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, then the narzil will bafwidge the most.\n\nTherefore, if the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, it is likely that the narzil will bafwidge the most.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
