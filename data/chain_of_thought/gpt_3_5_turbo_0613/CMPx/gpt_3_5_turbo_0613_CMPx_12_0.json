    "user_prompt": "Suppose a stribben, a vanoon, and a jentapp are applying to rent a bondle. The owner thinks the stribben is the strongest applicant, followed by the vanoon, while the jentapp seems much less qualified to rent a bondle. Since these are the only applicants, if the vanoon isn\u2019t selected, then if the stribben isn\u2019t selected, the jentapp will be selected. Moreover, the stribben likely will be chosen and hence the vanoon likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the stribben isn\u2019t selected to rent the bondle, the jentapp will be?",

            "content": "To determine whether it is likely that the jentapp will be selected if the stribben isn't, we need to consider the given information.\n\n1. The owner thinks the stribben is the strongest applicant, followed by the vanoon, while the jentapp seems much less qualified.\n2. If the vanoon isn't selected, and the stribben isn't selected, then the jentapp will be selected.\n3. The stribben is likely to be chosen, and hence the vanoon likely won't be.\n\nBased on these statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- The owner's preference is stribben > vanoon > jentapp.\n- If the stribben isn't selected, the jentapp will be selected.\n- The stribben is likely to be chosen, so it is unlikely that the vanoon will be selected.\n\nGiven that the vanoon is less likely to be selected, and the jentapp is the next option if the stribben isn't chosen, it is reasonable to conclude that it is likely that the jentapp will be selected if the stribben isn't.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
