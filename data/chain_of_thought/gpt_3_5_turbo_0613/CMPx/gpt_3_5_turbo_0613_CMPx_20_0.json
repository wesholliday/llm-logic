    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trundle, a foopet, and a crangor are likely to be the top selling whippits. The trundle will likely be #1 in sales, followed closely by the foopet, with the crangor having significantly lower expected sales. These lead whippit sales, so if the foopet isn\u2019t the top seller, then if the trundle isn\u2019t, the crangor will be. Moreover, the trundle likely will lead sales and hence the foopet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trundle isn\u2019t the top selling whippit, the crangor will be?",

            "content": "To determine whether it is likely that if the trundle isn't the top selling whippit, the crangor will be, we need to analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. The trundle is likely to be the top selling whippit.\n2. The foopet is likely to be the second top selling whippit, closely following the trundle.\n3. The crangor is expected to have significantly lower sales compared to the trundle and foopet.\n\nBased on the information provided, we can conclude that if the foopet isn't the top seller, then the trundle will be. This implies that the trundle is more likely to be the top seller than the foopet.\n\nHowever, the statement also mentions that the trundle likely will lead sales, and hence the foopet likely won't. This suggests that the foopet is less likely to be the top seller compared to the trundle.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where the trundle isn't the top selling whippit. In this case, the foopet would also not be the top seller. Since the crangor is the only remaining option, it would be the most likely candidate to be the top selling whippit if the trundle isn't.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, it is likely that if the trundle isn't the top selling whippit, the crangor will be.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
