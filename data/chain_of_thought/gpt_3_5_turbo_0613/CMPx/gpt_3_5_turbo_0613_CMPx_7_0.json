    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crastin, a nivet, and a jomial are the top bispets this breeding season. Breeders expect the crastin likely will birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, with the jomial birthing many fewer. These lead in birthing, so if the nivet doesn\u2019t birth the most offspring, then if the crastin doesn\u2019t, the jomial will. Moreover, the crastin likely will lead births and hence the nivet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the crastin doesn\u2019t lead births, the jomial will?",

            "content": "To determine whether it is likely that if the crastin doesn't lead births, the jomial will, we need to analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. The breeders expect the crastin to birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, and the jomial birthing many fewer.\n2. These three species lead in birthing, meaning one of them will birth the most offspring.\n3. If the nivet doesn't birth the most offspring, then either the crastin or the jomial will.\n4. Moreover, the crastin is likely to lead in births, which implies that the nivet is unlikely to lead in births.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that if the crastin doesn't lead in births, it is likely that the jomial will. This is because if the nivet doesn't birth the most offspring, then either the crastin or the jomial will, and the crastin is unlikely to be the one leading in births.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
