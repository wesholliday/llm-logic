    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a garplex, a beelhet, and a peedonk are competing to be domer of the year. Experts think the garplex is most likely to win, followed closely by the beelhet, with the peedonk having a much lower chance. Since these are the only domer candidates, if the beelhet doesn\u2019t become domer, then if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will become domer. Moreover, it is likely the garplex will become domer and hence the beelhet likely won\u2019t become domer. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will?",

            "content": "To determine whether it is likely that, if the garplex doesn't become domer, the peedonk will, we need to analyze the given information.\n\n1. The experts think the garplex is most likely to win, followed closely by the beelhet, with the peedonk having a much lower chance.\n2. If the beelhet doesn't become domer, then if the garplex doesn't become domer, the peedonk will become domer.\n3. It is likely that the garplex will become domer, and hence the beelhet likely won't become domer.\n\nBased on these statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- Since the garplex is most likely to win, it is reasonable to assume that if the garplex doesn't become domer, it would be an unexpected outcome.\n- If the garplex doesn't become domer, it means that the beelhet has a higher chance of becoming domer than the peedonk.\n- However, since it is likely that the garplex will become domer, the beelhet's chances of becoming domer are reduced.\n- Therefore, if the garplex doesn't become domer, the peedonk would have a higher chance of becoming domer than the beelhet.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
