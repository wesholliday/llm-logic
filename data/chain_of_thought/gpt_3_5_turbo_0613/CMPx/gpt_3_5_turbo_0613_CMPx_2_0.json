    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect are applying for one open zulision. The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

            "content": "To determine whether it is likely that if the jantiz doesn't get the zulision, the sulect will, we need to analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant.\n2. The cramen is considered less qualified than the jantiz.\n3. The sulect has weaker qualifications than both the jantiz and the cramen.\n4. If the cramen doesn't get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn't, the sulect will.\n\nBased on the given information, we can conclude that if the jantiz doesn't get the zulision, the sulect will have a chance of getting it. However, the likelihood of the sulect getting the zulision is not explicitly stated. It only states that if the jantiz and the cramen don't get it, the sulect will. The likelihood of the jantiz not getting the zulision is also not explicitly stated, only that it is likely that the jantiz will get it.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively determine whether it is likely that if the jantiz doesn't get the zulision, the sulect will. \n\nAnswer: No",
