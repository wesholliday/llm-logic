    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crinel, a nafiz, and a tomul are competing to be snarggle of next year's laggle team. The crinel is considered the frontrunner for snarggle, followed by the nafiz, while the tomul is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates, if the nafiz isn\u2019t named snarggle, then if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle. Moreover, the crinel likely will be named snarggle and hence the nafiz likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be?",

            "content": "To determine whether it is likely that if the crinel isn't named snarggle, the tomul will be, we need to analyze the given information.\n\n1. The crinel is considered the frontrunner for snarggle, followed by the nafiz, while the tomul is a long shot.\n2. If the nafiz isn't named snarggle, then if the crinel isn't named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle.\n3. The crinel is likely to be named snarggle, and hence the nafiz is likely not to be.\n\nBased on this information, we can make the following observations:\n\n- The crinel is the most likely candidate to be named snarggle.\n- If the crinel isn't named snarggle, it means the nafiz also isn't named snarggle.\n- In this scenario, the tomul will be named snarggle.\n\nTherefore, it is likely that if the crinel isn't named snarggle, the tomul will be.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
