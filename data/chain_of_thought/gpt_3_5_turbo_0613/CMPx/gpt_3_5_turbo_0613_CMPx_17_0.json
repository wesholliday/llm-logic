    "user_prompt": "Suppose a flinker, a dringen, and a n\u00fcffen have the best projections to have a breakout season next year. Talent scouts believe it's highly probable the flinker will have a breakout season, followed closely by the dringen, while the n\u00fcffen is an outside shot. Since these are the only top prospects, if the dringen doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season. Moreover, scouts think the flinker will likely have a breakout season and hence the dringen likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will?",

            "content": "To determine whether it is likely that, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will, we need to analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. The flinker, dringen, and n\u00fcffen are the top prospects for a breakout season.\n2. Talent scouts believe it's highly probable that the flinker will have a breakout season, followed closely by the dringen.\n3. If the dringen doesn't have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season.\n4. Scouts think the flinker will likely have a breakout season, and hence the dringen likely won't.\n\nBased on this information, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If the flinker has a breakout season, then the dringen is less likely to have a breakout season (point 4).\n- If the dringen doesn't have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season (point 3).\n\nTherefore, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, it is more likely that the dringen also won't have a breakout season. Consequently, if the dringen doesn't have a breakout season, it is likely that the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
