The statement \"If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired\" implies that sufficient sleep prevents tiredness.\n2. The second part of the question states \"if you get enough sleep and do hard labor.\" This means that in addition to getting enough sleep, you are also engaging in physically demanding work.\n3. Hard labor requires physical exertion and can be tiring, regardless of how much sleep you have had.\n4. While getting enough sleep can help reduce fatigue, it may not completely eliminate tiredness caused by strenuous physical activity.\n5. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that if you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired.\n\nAnswer: No",
