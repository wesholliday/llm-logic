If the pilot light is out, then the oven is not on. This is a logical inference, as the pilot light is necessary for the oven to be on.\n\n3. If the oven is not on, then we cannot infer anything about the temperature of the kitchen. This is because the initial statement only tells us that if the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm. It does not provide any information about what happens when the oven is not on.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we cannot infer that if the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm. \n\nAnswer: No",
