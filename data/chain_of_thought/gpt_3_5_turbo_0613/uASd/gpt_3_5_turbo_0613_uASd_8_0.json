If the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today. This is the statement we need to determine if we can infer from the given statement.\n\nBased on the given statement, we know that if the package has shipped, it will arrive today. However, the given statement does not provide any information about what happens if the package is misrouted. Misrouting could potentially cause delays or changes in the delivery schedule.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the package has shipped and it was misrouted, it will arrive today.\n\nAnswer: No",
