This implies that a well-written essay is a sufficient condition for receiving an A.\n\nHowever, the statement does not provide any information about the impact of turning in the essay late. We cannot assume that turning in the essay late will have no effect on the grade. It is possible that late submission could result in a grade deduction or penalty.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that if the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A.\n\nAnswer: No",
