This statement tells us that paying the bill is a necessary condition for the services to continue.\n\n2. If the check bounces, then the bill is not paid. This statement tells us that if the check bounces, it means that the bill has not been paid.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n3. If the bill is paid and the check bounces, then the bill is not paid. This statement is a logical combination of statements 1 and 2.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that if the bill is paid and the check bounces, then the bill is not paid. However, we cannot directly infer whether the services will continue or not based on this information alone.",
