The statement \"If I exercise, I will lose weight\" suggests that exercise is a factor that contributes to weight loss. This implies that exercise alone can lead to weight loss.\n\n2. The second part of the question states \"if I exercise and eat junk food, will I lose weight?\" Here, we need to consider the impact of eating junk food on weight loss.\n\n3. Junk food is typically high in calories, unhealthy fats, and sugars. Consuming excessive calories can lead to weight gain or hinder weight loss progress, even if exercise is being performed.\n\n4. While exercise can help burn calories and contribute to weight loss, it may not be enough to counteract the negative effects of a poor diet, such as eating junk food.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can conclude that exercising and eating junk food may not necessarily lead to weight loss. In fact, the consumption of junk food could potentially hinder weight loss progress, even with regular exercise.\n\nAnswer: No",
