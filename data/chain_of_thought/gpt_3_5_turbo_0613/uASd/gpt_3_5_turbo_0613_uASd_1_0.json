In other words, if the match is struck, it will definitely light.\n\nNow, we introduce a new condition: \"the match has been soaked in water.\" We need to determine if this new condition affects the match's ability to light when struck.\n\nBased on common knowledge, we know that water can extinguish a flame. So, if the match has been soaked in water, it is likely that the water has affected its ability to light.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the match is struck and it has been soaked in water, it is less likely to light compared to a dry match.\n\nAnswer: No",
