If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nThis statement implies that whenever the griffin is in the forest, the unicorn is also in the forest. However, it does not provide any information about the unicorn's location when the griffin is not in the forest.\n\nBased on this information alone, we cannot infer anything about the griffin's location when the unicorn is in the forest. The statement only establishes a one-way relationship between the griffin and the unicorn, indicating that if the griffin is in the forest, the unicorn is also in the forest.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was in the forest.\n\nAnswer: No",
