This statement establishes a conditional relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana.\n\n2. If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red. This statement suggests a reverse conditional relationship, where the color of the banana determines the color of the apple.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logic:\n\n- The first statement establishes that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow. This means that whenever we have a red apple, we can be certain that the banana is yellow.\n\n- However, the second statement suggests that if the banana is yellow, then the apple is red. This implies that whenever we have a yellow banana, we can be certain that the apple is red.\n\nBased on the information given, we can conclude that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. However, we cannot infer that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red. The second statement is not necessarily true because there could be other factors that determine the color of the apple, independent of the color of the banana.\n\nAnswer: No",
