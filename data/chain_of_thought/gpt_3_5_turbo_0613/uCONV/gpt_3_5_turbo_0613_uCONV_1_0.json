This statement implies that Mary's presence at the wedding guarantees Sue's presence as well.\n\n2. However, the reverse statement is not necessarily true. Just because Sue was at the wedding does not mean that Mary was also present. It is possible for Sue to be at the wedding without Mary being there.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we cannot infer that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No",
