It implies that Jeff playing basketball is a sufficient condition for Amy playing tennis. In other words, if Jeff plays basketball, it guarantees that Amy will play tennis.\n\nHowever, the statement does not provide any information about the reverse relationship. It does not state that Amy playing tennis is a sufficient condition for Jeff playing basketball. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
