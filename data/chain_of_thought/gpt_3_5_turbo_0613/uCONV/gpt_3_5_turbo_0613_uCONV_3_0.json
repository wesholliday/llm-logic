However, it does not tell us anything about books written by other authors.\n\nThe second statement is the inverse of the first statement: \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James.\" Inverse statements are formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion of a conditional statement. \n\nIn this case, the inverse statement is saying that if a book is a mystery novel, then it must have been written by James. However, this is not necessarily true. There could be other authors who write mystery novels as well.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
