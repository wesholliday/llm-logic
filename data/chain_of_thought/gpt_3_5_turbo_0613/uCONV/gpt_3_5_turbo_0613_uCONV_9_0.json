If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nThis statement implies a cause-and-effect relationship. It suggests that Lisa's purchase of the red shirt is the cause, and Mark's purchase of the blue shirt is the effect.\n\nNow, let's consider the reverse statement:\n\n2. If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nThis statement suggests that Mark's purchase of the blue shirt is the cause, and Lisa's purchase of the red shirt is the effect.\n\nBased on the given information, we can infer that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. However, we cannot directly infer that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt. The first statement does not provide enough information to establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship in the opposite direction.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
