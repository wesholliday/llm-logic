If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n\nBased on this statement, we can conclude that if the bear is in the cave, it implies that the wolf is in the den.\n\nNow let's analyze the second part of the question:\n\n2. Can we infer that if the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the cave?\n\nTo answer this, we need to determine if the reverse implication is true. In other words, if we know that the wolf is in the den, can we conclude that the bear is in the cave?\n\nBased on the given statement, we only have information about the relationship between the bear and the wolf when the bear is in the cave. We don't have any information about what happens when the wolf is in the den without knowing the bear's location.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the cave.\n\nAnswer: No",
