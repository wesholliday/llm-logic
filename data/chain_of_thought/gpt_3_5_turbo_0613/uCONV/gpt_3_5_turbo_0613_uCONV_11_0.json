This statement implies that whenever the cake is chocolate, the muffins will always be blueberry.\n\n2. Now, we need to determine if we can infer the reverse statement: if the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate.\n\nTo do this, we need to consider if the original statement guarantees that the only way for the muffins to be blueberry is if the cake is chocolate. If there are other possibilities for the muffins to be blueberry, then we cannot infer that the cake must be chocolate.\n\nSo, let's consider a scenario where the muffins are blueberry but the cake is not chocolate. In this case, the original statement does not hold true because the muffins are blueberry without the cake being chocolate. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate.\n\nAnswer: No",
