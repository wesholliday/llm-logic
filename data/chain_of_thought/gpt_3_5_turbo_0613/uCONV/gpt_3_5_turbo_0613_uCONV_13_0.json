It suggests that whenever the car is red, the truck is blue. However, it does not provide any information about what happens when the truck is blue.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the truck was blue, then the car was red based solely on the given statement. The statement only establishes a one-way conditional relationship, not a bi-conditional relationship.",
