This means that one of these two options must be true.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the smip might not be lupped. This means that there is a possibility that the smip is not lupped.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that the smip must be shripped. If it is not lupped (as stated in statement 2), then it must be shripped (as stated in statement 1).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
