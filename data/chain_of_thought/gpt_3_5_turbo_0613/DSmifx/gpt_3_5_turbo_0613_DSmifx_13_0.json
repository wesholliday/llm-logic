This means that one of these two options must be true.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that there is a possibility that the glip is not tragged. This means that the first option mentioned in statement 1 (\"the glip must be tragged\") might not be true.\n\nHowever, statement 2 does not provide any information about whether the glip is slogged or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The glip is slogged\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
