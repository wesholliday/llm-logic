This means that one of these two options must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the fleeg might not be surned. This means that there is a possibility that the fleeg is not surned.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively infer that \"The fleeg is bluttered.\" It is possible that the fleeg is bluttered, but it could also be surned or have some other status. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
