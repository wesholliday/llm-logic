This means that one of these two conditions must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the flob might not be movated. This means that there is a possibility that the flob is not movated.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively infer that \"The flob is skizzled.\" The possibility remains that the flob is not movated but also not skizzled. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
