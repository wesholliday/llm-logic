The first statement is \"Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed.\" This statement suggests that the splat can either be quanked or morphed, but it does not provide any information about the current state of the splat.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The splat might not be quanked.\" This statement implies that there is a possibility that the splat is not quanked. However, it does not provide any information about whether the splat is morphed or not.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot directly infer that \"The splat is morphed.\" The information provided does not give us enough evidence to make a conclusive statement about the state of the splat.\n\nAnswer: No",
