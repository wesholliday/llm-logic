It implies that one of these conditions must be true.\n\n2. \"The zinger might not be smoogled.\"\n   This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the zinger is not smoogled. It does not provide any information about whether the zinger is fraggled or not.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot directly infer that \"The zinger is fraggled.\" The second statement only tells us that the zinger might not be smoogled, but it does not provide any information about whether it is fraggled or not. Therefore, we cannot make a conclusive inference about the zinger being fraggled based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
