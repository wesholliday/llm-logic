This means that one of these two conditions must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the sprocket might not be daggled. This means that the possibility of the sprocket being daggled is uncertain.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively infer that \"The sprocket is cranked.\" The possibility remains that the sprocket is not daggled but also not cranked. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
