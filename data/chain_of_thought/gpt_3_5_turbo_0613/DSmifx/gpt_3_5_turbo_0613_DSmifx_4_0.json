This statement does not exclude the possibility that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the fribble might not be crinked. This means that the possibility of the fribble being snurgled is still open.\n\nBased on this analysis, we cannot definitively infer that \"The fribble is snurgled\" from the given statements.",
