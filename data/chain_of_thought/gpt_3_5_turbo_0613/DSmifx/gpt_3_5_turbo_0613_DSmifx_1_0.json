It does not exclude the possibility of the flugel being both zargled and blimmed.\n\n2. \"The flugel might not be zargled.\"\n   This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the flugel is not zargled. It does not provide any information about whether the flugel is blimmed or not.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot definitively infer that \"The flugel is blimmed.\" The possibility remains that the flugel could be blimmed, zargled, or even both. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
