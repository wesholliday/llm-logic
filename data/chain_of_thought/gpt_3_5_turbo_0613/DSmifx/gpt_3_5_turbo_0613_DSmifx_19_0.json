This means that one of these two conditions must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the smonk might not be plagged. This means that the possibility of the smonk not being plagged exists.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively conclude that the smonk is vreebled based on the given information. While it is one of the possibilities, we do not have enough information to determine if it is the actual state of the smonk.\n\nAnswer: No",
