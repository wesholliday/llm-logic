It does not exclude the possibility of both conditions being true or both being false.\n\n2. \"The flug might not be zimmed\": This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the flug is not zimmed. It does not provide any information about whether the flug is blummed or not.\n\nBased on these statements alone, we cannot definitively infer that \"The flug is blummed.\" The given information does not provide enough evidence to make a conclusive determination about the flug's blummed status.\n\nAnswer: No",
