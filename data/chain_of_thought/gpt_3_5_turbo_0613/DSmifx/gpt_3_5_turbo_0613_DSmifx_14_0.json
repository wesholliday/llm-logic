This means that one of these two conditions must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the clug might not be snugged. This means that there is a possibility that the clug is not snugged.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively infer that \"The clug is fleeked.\" The possibility remains that the clug is not snugged, which means it could be fleeked or not fleeked. Therefore, we cannot make a conclusive inference about the fleeking status of the clug.\n\nAnswer: No",
