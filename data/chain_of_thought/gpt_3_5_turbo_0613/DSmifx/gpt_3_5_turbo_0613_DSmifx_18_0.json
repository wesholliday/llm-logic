This means that one of these conditions must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the shank might not be nugged. This means that there is a possibility that the shank is not nugged.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively infer that \"The shank is plooked.\" The possibility remains that the shank is not nugged, but it does not necessarily mean that it is plooked. There could be other possibilities or conditions that we are not aware of.\n\nAnswer: No",
