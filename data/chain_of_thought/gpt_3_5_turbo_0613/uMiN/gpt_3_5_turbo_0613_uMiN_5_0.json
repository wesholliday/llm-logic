However, this does not necessarily mean that he must not have played basketball. It is still possible that he did play basketball despite the uncertainty.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that it's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball based solely on the statement \"Jeff might not have played basketball.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
