This means that it is not certain whether she bought it or not.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" implies that it is a necessity or requirement for Lisa to have bought the red shirt. This means that there is no possibility that she did not buy it.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer that if Lisa might not have bought the red shirt, then it is not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
