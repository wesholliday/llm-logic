However, this does not necessarily mean that Alex must have finished the race. The statement \"Alex might not have finished the race\" leaves room for the possibility that Alex did finish the race, but it is not certain.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that it's not the case that Alex must have finished the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
