This means that it is not certain whether the alien visited Mars or not.\n\nIf we negate this statement, we get \"It is not the case that the alien might not have visited Mars.\" This can be simplified to \"The alien might have visited Mars.\" \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that it is not the case that the alien must have visited Mars based on the initial statement. \n\nAnswer: No",
