This means that it is not certain or definite that James is the author.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James\" implies that there is no necessity or requirement for James to be the author. This means that James being the author is not a definite or absolute conclusion.\n\nGiven these considerations, we can infer that it is possible that the book was not written by James, but we cannot definitively conclude that it must not have been written by James.\n\nAnswer: No",
