However, this does not necessarily imply that she must not have been there. It is possible that she attended the wedding despite the uncertainty.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding based solely on the statement \"Mary might not have been at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
