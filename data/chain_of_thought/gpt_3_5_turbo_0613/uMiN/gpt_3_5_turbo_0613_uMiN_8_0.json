This means that being awake is not a certainty.\n\nHowever, the statement \"It's not the case that the vampire must have been awake\" implies that being awake is not a requirement or necessity. In other words, it suggests that the vampire could have been awake or not awake.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer that it is indeed the case that the vampire must not have been awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
