However, statement 1 does not provide any information about what happens if the flob was not skizzled.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the flob movated, but it does not provide any information about whether the flob was skizzled or not.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot definitively infer whether \"The flob was skizzled\" or not.",
