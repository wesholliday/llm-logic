It implies that if the sprocket was cranked, then it would be daggled.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the sprocket was indeed daggled.\n\nTo infer that the sprocket was cranked, we need to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between the two statements. However, the given information does not provide any direct evidence that the sprocket being daggled is solely caused by it being cranked. It is possible that there are other ways for the sprocket to become daggled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the sprocket was cranked.\n\nAnswer: No",
