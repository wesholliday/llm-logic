However, we cannot conclude anything about the sneg being crampled if it did not sprot the frink.\n\nIn statement 2, it is given that the sneg sproted the frink. This does not provide any information about whether the sneg was crampled or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer whether \"The sneg was crampled\" or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
