It states that if the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the fribble was not snurgled.\n\n2. \"The fribble crinked.\"\nThis statement tells us that the fribble crinked, but it does not provide any information about whether or not the fribble was snurgled.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot directly infer that \"The fribble was snurgled.\" The first statement only establishes a one-way conditional relationship, and the second statement does not provide any information about the snurgling of the fribble.\n\nAnswer: No",
