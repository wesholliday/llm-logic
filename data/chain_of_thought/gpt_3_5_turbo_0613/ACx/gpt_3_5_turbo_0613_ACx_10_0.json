This means that garpling is a necessary condition for sproinging. \n\nIn statement 2, it is given that the wug was garpled. \n\nBased on these statements, we can infer that the wug was sproinged if and only if garpling is the only condition for sproinging. If there are other conditions for sproinging that are not mentioned, we cannot make the inference.\n\nAnswer: It depends on whether garpling is the only condition for sproinging.",
