However, if A is false, we cannot make any conclusions about B.\n\nIn statement 2, we are given that \"The smonk plagged\" is true. \n\nBased on this information, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If the smonk was vreebled (A), then the smonk plagged (B).\n- The smonk plagged (B).\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer whether the smonk was vreebled (A) or not based on the given statements. The smonk could have been vreebled or not vreebled, and both scenarios would still be consistent with the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
