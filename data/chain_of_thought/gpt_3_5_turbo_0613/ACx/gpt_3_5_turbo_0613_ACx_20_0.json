It states that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\n\n2. \"The fleeg surned\" - This statement tells us that the fleeg surned.\n\nTo infer that \"The fleeg was bluttered,\" we need to determine if the first statement is true and if the second statement satisfies the condition in the first statement.\n\nIf the first statement is true, it means that whenever the fleeg is bluttered, it will surn. However, the second statement only tells us that the fleeg surned; it does not provide any information about whether the fleeg was bluttered or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The fleeg was bluttered\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
