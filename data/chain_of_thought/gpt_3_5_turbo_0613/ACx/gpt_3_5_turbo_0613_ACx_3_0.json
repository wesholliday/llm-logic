It states that if the splat was morphed, then it quanked.\n\nThe second statement simply states that the splat quanked. It does not provide any information about whether or not the splat was morphed.\n\nTo infer that \"The splat was morphed,\" we would need to know that the second statement is true and that the first statement is also true. However, we do not have any information about the truth value of the first statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The splat was morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
