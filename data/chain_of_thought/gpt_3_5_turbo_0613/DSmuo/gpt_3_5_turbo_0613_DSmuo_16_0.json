In other words, the pen may or may not be on the desk.\n\n2. \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk.\"\n   This statement presents two possibilities: either the pen is in the bag or it is on the desk. It does not exclude the possibility of the pen being in the bag.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that the pen is in the bag. While it is a possibility, the statements do not provide enough evidence to make a conclusive inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
