In other words, the missing sock could be somewhere other than under the bed.\n\nStatement 2: \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed.\"\nThis statement presents two possibilities: either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it is under the bed. It does not exclude the possibility of the missing sock being in any other location.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that the missing sock could be in the laundry basket because it is one of the possibilities mentioned in Statement 2. However, we cannot definitively infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket because there is still a possibility that it could be in another location.\n\nAnswer: No",
