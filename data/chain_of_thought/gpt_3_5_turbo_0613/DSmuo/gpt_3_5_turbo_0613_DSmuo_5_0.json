In other words, the cookies may or may not be in the pantry.\n\n2. \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n   This statement presents two possibilities: either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry. It does not exclude the possibility of the cookies being in the pantry.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The cookies are in the jar.\" The second statement allows for the possibility that the cookies are hidden in the pantry. Therefore, we cannot infer the location of the cookies with certainty.\n\nAnswer: No",
