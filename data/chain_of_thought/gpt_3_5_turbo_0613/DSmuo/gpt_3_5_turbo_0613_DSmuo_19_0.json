In other words, the watch can be somewhere other than his wrist.\n\n2. \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\"\n   This statement presents two possibilities: either the watch is charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist. It implies that these are the only two options.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that if it is not necessary for the watch to be on his wrist and the only other option is for it to be charging on the dresser, then we can infer that \"The watch is charging on the dresser.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
