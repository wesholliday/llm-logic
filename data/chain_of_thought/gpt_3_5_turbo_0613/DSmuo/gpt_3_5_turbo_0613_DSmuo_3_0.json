In other words, the keys may or may not be in the cabinet.\n\n2. \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n   This statement presents two possibilities: either the keys are in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet. It does not exclude the possibility of the keys being in the cabinet.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot definitively infer that \"The keys are in the drawer.\" The statements allow for the possibility that the keys could be in the cabinet. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
