In other words, the phone may or may not be ringing in the kitchen.\n\n2. \"Either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen.\"\n   This statement presents two possibilities: either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen. It does not exclude the possibility of the phone being in the living room.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The phone is in the living room.\" The statements allow for the possibility that the phone could be in either the living room or the kitchen.",
