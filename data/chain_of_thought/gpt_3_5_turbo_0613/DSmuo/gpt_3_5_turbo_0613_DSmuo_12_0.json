In other words, the jacket may or may not be in the closet.\n\n2. \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet.\"\n   This statement presents two possibilities: either the jacket is draped over the chair or it is hanging in the closet. It does not exclude the possibility of the jacket being in the closet.\n\nBased on these statements, we cannot definitively infer that \"The jacket is draped over the chair.\" The first statement tells us that the jacket may or may not be in the closet, and the second statement allows for the possibility of the jacket being in the closet. Therefore, we do not have enough information to conclude that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: No",
