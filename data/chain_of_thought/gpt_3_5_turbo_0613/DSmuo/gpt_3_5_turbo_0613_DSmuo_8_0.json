In other words, it is possible for the remote control to be somewhere other than under the couch.\n\nStatement 2: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\nThis statement presents two possibilities: either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is under the couch. It does not exclude the possibility of the remote control being somewhere else.\n\nBased on these statements, we cannot definitively infer that the remote control is on the coffee table. While it is a possibility, the statements do not provide enough information to make a conclusive inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
