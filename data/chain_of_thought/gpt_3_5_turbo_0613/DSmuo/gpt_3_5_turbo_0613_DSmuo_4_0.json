In other words, playing in the bedroom is not a requirement.\n\nStatement 2: \"Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom.\"\nThis statement presents two possibilities: either the cat is napping on the couch or it is playing in the bedroom. It does not exclude the possibility of the cat napping on the couch.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that the cat could be napping on the couch. However, we cannot definitively infer that the cat is napping on the couch because the possibility of the cat playing in the bedroom still exists.\n\nAnswer: No",
