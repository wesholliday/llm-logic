It allows for both possibilities.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n   This statement negates the possibility that Fido must be in the garden. It tells us that Fido is not necessarily in the garden.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that Fido is inside. This is because the first statement allows for the possibility of Fido being inside, and the second statement eliminates the possibility of Fido being in the garden. Therefore, the only remaining option is that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
