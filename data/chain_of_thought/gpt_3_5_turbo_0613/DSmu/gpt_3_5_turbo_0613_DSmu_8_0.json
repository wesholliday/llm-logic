This is because the statement presents two possibilities.\n\nStatement 2 negates the possibility that the remote control must be hiding under the couch. This means that the remote control cannot be exclusively under the couch.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that the remote control must be on the coffee table. This is because the only remaining possibility, after eliminating the option of it being under the couch, is that it is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
