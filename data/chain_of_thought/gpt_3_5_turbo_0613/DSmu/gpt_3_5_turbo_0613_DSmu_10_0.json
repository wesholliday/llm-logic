This is because the word \"either\" indicates that one of the two options must be true.\n\nStatement 2 states that it is not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed. This means that the possibility of the missing sock being under the bed is eliminated.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that the missing sock must be in the laundry basket because the only remaining option is the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
