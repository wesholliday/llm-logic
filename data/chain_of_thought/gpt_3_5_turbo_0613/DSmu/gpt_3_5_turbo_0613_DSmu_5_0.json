This statement allows for either option to be true.\n\nStatement 2 negates the possibility that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry. This means that the cookies cannot be exclusively in the pantry.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the only remaining possibility is that the cookies are in the jar. Therefore, we can infer \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
