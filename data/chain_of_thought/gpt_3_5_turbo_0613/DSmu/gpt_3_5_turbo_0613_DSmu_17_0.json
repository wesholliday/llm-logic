It cannot be both places simultaneously.\n\nStatement 2 negates the possibility that the scarf must be on the coat rack. This means that the scarf cannot be on the coat rack.\n\nCombining the two statements, we can conclude that the scarf must be in the backpack because it cannot be on the coat rack.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
