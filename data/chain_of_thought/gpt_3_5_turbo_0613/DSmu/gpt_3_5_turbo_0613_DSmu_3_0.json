This statement does not exclude the possibility of the keys being in the drawer.\n\nStatement 2 negates the possibility that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet. This means that the keys cannot only be dangling in the cabinet, but it does not provide any information about the keys being in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The keys are in the drawer.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
