It implies that the pen must be in one of these two locations.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\"\n   This statement negates the possibility that the pen must be on the desk. It tells us that the pen is not necessarily on the desk.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that the pen is in my bag. This is because if the pen is not on the desk (as stated in the second statement), and it must be either in my bag or on my desk (as stated in the first statement), then the only remaining possibility is that the pen is in my bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
