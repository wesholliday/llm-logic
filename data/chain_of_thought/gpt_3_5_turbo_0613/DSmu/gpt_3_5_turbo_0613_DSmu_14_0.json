It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the milk is not on the counter, then it must be chilling in the fridge. This is because the statement presents two options and implies that one of them must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge. This means that the second option presented in statement 1 (the milk chilling in the fridge) is not true.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that the milk is on the counter. This is because if the milk is not on the counter, it must be chilling in the fridge, but statement 2 tells us that it is not the case.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
