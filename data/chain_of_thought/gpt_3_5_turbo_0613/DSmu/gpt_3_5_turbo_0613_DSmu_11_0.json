This is because the statement presents two options and implies that one of them must be true.\n\nStatement 2 negates the idea that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch. This means that it is not necessary for the newspaper to be on the porch.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that the newspaper is in the driveway. This is because if it is not on the porch (as stated in Statement 2), then it must be in the driveway (as stated in Statement 1).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
