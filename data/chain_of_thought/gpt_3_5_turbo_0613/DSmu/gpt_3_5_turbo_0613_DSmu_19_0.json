It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the watch is not on his wrist, then it must be charging on the dresser. This is because the statement presents two options and if one option is not true, then the other option must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not the case that the watch must be on his wrist. This means that the watch is not on his wrist.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
