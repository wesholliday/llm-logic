This statement establishes a disjunction, meaning at least one of the options must be true.\n\nStatement 2 negates the possibility that the jacket must be hanging in the closet. This means that the second option in Statement 1 (the jacket hanging in the closet) is not true.\n\nTherefore, the only remaining possibility is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
