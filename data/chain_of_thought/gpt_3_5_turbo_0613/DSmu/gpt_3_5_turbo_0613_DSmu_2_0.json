It implies that one of these options must be true.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n   This statement negates the possibility that the book must be resting on the table. It tells us that the second option mentioned in the first statement is not true.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that the book is on the shelf. This is because if the book is not resting on the table (as stated in the second statement), and the first statement tells us that one of the options must be true, then the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
