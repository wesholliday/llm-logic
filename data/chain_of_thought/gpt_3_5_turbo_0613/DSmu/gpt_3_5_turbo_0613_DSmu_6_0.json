It allows for both possibilities.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen.\"\n   This statement negates the possibility that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen. It tells us that the phone is not necessarily ringing in the kitchen.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that the phone is in the living room. This is because if the phone is not necessarily ringing in the kitchen and it is either in the living room or ringing in the kitchen, then the only remaining possibility is that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
