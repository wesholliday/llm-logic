This statement does not provide any information about which possibility is true.\n\nStatement 2 negates the possibility that the cat must be playing in the bedroom. This means that it is not necessary for the cat to be playing in the bedroom, but it does not provide any information about whether the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: No",
