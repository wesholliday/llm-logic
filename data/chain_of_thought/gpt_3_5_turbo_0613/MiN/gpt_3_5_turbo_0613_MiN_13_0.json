It does not provide a definitive statement about the toy's location.\n\n\"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\" implies that the toy is not required or obligated to be in the toy box. This statement suggests that the toy can be located elsewhere.\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\" from \"The toy might not be in the toy box.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
