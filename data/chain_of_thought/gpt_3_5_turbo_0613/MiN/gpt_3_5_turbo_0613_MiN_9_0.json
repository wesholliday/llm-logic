            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" from \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt,\" we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe statement \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\" suggests that there is a possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. It does not provide certainty or definitiveness about whether she bought it or not.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" implies that there is no necessity or obligation for Lisa to have bought the red shirt. It suggests that there is a possibility that she did not buy it, but it does not exclude the possibility that she did buy it.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer that \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" from \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
