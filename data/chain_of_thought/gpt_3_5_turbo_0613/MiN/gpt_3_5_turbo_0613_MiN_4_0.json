This statement does not provide certainty or definitiveness about whether the alien visited Mars or not.\n\n\"It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars\" implies that there is no necessity or obligation for the alien to have visited Mars. This statement suggests that visiting Mars is not a requirement or a certainty.\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer \"It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars\" from \"The alien might not have visited Mars\" because if there is a possibility that the alien did not visit Mars, then it is not a necessity or requirement for the alien to have visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
