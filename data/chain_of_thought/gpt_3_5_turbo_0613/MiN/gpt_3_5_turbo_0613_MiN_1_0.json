It does not provide a definitive answer about whether she was there or not.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" implies that it is not necessary or obligatory for Mary to have been present at the wedding. It suggests that there is no requirement for her attendance.\n\nGiven these meanings, we can infer that \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" from \"Mary might not have been at the wedding.\" This is because if there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding, then it is not necessary for her to have been there.",
