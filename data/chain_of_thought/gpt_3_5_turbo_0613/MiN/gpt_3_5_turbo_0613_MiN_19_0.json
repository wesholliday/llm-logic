This statement does not provide a definitive answer about the location or status of the watch.\n\nOn the other hand, \"It's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser\" implies that it is not necessary for the watch to be charging on the dresser. This statement suggests that the watch could be charging elsewhere or not charging at all.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer \"It's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser\" from \"The watch might not be charging on the dresser.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
