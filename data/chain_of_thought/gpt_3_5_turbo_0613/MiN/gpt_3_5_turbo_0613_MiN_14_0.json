It does not provide a definitive statement about the milk's location.\n\n\"It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter\" implies that the milk is not required or obligated to be on the counter. It suggests that there is no necessity for the milk to be on the counter.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer \"It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter\" from \"The milk might not be on the counter\" because if there is a possibility that the milk is not on the counter, then it is not necessary for the milk to be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
