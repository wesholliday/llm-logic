This means that there is at least some doubt or uncertainty about the authorship of the book.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James\" implies that it is not necessary or obligatory for James to be the author of the book. This means that there is no requirement or compulsion for James to have written the book.\n\nGiven these explanations, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James\" from \"The book might not have been written by James.\" The possibility or uncertainty expressed in the first statement allows for the conclusion that there is no necessity or obligation for James to be the author of the book.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
