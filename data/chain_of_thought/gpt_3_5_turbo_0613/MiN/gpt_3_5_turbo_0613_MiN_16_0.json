It does not provide a definitive statement about the pen's location.\n\n\"It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag\" implies that the pen is not required or obligated to be in the bag. It suggests that there is no necessity for the pen to be in the bag.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer \"It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag\" from \"The pen might not be in my bag\" because if there is a possibility that the pen is not in the bag, then it is not necessary for the pen to be in the bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
