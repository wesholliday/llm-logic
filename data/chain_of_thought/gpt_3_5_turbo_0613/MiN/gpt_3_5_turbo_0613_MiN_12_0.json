It does not provide a definitive statement about whether the jacket is or is not on the chair.\n\nOn the other hand, \"It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair\" implies that it is not necessary or required for the jacket to be on the chair. This statement suggests that the jacket can be placed elsewhere or not on the chair at all.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair\" from \"The jacket might not be draped over the chair.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
