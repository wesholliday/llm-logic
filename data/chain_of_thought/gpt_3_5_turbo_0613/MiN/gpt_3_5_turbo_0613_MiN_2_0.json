This means that it is possible for the griffin to be somewhere other than the forest.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\" implies that there is no necessity for the griffin to be in the forest. This means that the griffin could be in a different location or may not exist at all.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\" from \"The griffin might not have been in the forest.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
