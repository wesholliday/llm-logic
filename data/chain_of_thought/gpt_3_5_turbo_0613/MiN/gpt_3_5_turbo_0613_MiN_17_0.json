This means that it is not certain or required for the scarf to be stuffed in the backpack.\n\nOn the other hand, \"It's not the case that the scarf must be stuffed in my backpack\" implies that it is not necessary or obligatory for the scarf to be inside the backpack.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the scarf must be stuffed in my backpack\" from \"The scarf might not be stuffed in my backpack.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
