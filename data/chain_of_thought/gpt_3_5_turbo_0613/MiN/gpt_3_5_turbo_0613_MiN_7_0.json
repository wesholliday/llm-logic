It does not provide any certainty or requirement regarding whether Alex finished the race or not.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race\" implies that it is not necessary or obligatory for Alex to have finished the race. It suggests that there is no requirement for Alex to have completed the race.\n\nGiven these meanings, we can infer that \"It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race\" from \"Alex might not have finished the race.\" This is because if there is a possibility that Alex did not finish the race, then it is not necessary or obligatory for Alex to have finished it.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
