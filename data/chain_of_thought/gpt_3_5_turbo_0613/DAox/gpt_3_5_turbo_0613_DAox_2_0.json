This tells us nothing about whether the wug bimmed the zoint or not.\n\nFrom statement 2, we have a conditional statement: \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\" This means that if the wug was flooped, it would have bimmed the zoint. However, we don't have any information about whether the wug was actually flooped or not.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot infer whether \"The wug did not bim the zoint\" is true or not. The statements do not provide enough information to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No",
