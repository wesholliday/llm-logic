It states that if the splat was morphed, then it quanked.\n\nBased on these statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If the splat was morphed, then it quanked (from statement 2).\n- The splat was not morphed (from statement 1).\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The splat did not quank\"?\n\nTo answer this, we need to consider the logical implications of the given statements. Since the first statement tells us that the splat was not morphed, we can conclude that the condition in the second statement (\"If the splat was morphed\") is not satisfied. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about whether the splat quanked or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
