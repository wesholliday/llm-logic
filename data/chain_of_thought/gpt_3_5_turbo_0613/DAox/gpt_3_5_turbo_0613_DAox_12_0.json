It states that if the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint.\n\nBased on these statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If the smip was not shripped (as stated in the first statement), then the conditional statement in the second statement does not apply. In other words, we cannot determine whether the smip lupped the zoint or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The smip did not lup the zoint\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
