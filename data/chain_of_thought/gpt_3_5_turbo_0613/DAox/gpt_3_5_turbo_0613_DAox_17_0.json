It states that if the flob was skizzled, then it movated.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can make the following logical deductions:\n\n- If the flob was skizzled, then it movated.\n- The flob was not skizzled.\n\nFrom these deductions, we cannot directly infer whether \"The flob was not movated\" because we don't have any information about whether the flob was skizzled or not. The given statements only tell us that the flob was not skizzled, but they do not provide any information about whether the flob was movated or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The flob was not movated\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
