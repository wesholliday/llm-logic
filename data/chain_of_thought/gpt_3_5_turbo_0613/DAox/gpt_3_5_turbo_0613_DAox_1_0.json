It states that if the flugel was blimmed, then it was zargled.\n\nBased on these statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If the flugel was blimmed, then it was zargled (from statement 2).\n- But we know that the flugel was not blimmed (from statement 1).\n- Therefore, we cannot conclude anything about whether the flugel was zargled or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
