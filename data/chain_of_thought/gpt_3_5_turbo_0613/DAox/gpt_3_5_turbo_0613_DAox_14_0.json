It states that if the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\n\nBased on these statements, we can make the following logical deductions:\n\n- If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\n- The clug was not fleeked.\n\nFrom these deductions, we can conclude that:\n\n- The clug was not snugged.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
