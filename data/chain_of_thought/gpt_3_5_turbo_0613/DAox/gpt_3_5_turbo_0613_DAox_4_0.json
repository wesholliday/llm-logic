This means that the condition in Statement 2, \"if the fribble was snurgled,\" is not satisfied. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusions about what happens if the fribble was snurgled.\n\nSince we cannot determine whether the fribble was snurgled or not, we cannot infer whether the fribble crinked or not. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The fribble did not crink.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
