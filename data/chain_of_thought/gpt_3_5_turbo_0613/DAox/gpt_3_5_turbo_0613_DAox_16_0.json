It states that if the sneg was crampled, then it sproted the frink.\n\nBased on these statements, we can make the following logical deductions:\n\n- If the sneg was not crampled (as stated in the first statement), then the conditional statement in the second statement does not apply. In other words, we cannot determine whether the sneg sproted the frink or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The sneg did not sprot the frink\" from the given statements.",
