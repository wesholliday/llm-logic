It states that if the grommet was sploffed, then it plopped the frink.\n\nBased on these statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If the grommet did not sploff (as stated in the first statement), then the conditional statement in the second statement does not apply. This means that we cannot conclude whether the grommet plopped the frink or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The grommet did not plop the frink\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
