It states that if the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\n\nBased on these statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If the smonk was vreebled, then it plagged.\n- But we know that the smonk was not vreebled.\n- Therefore, we cannot conclude anything about whether the smonk was plagged or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
