It states that if the zinger was fraggled, then it was also smoogled.\n\nBased on these statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If the zinger was fraggled, then it was smoogled.\n- The zinger was not fraggled.\n\nFrom these deductions, we can conclude that:\n\n- The zinger was not smoogled.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: yes.",
