However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the wug was not sproinged.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot directly infer whether or not the wug was garpled. The statements only provide information about the wug not being sproinged, but they do not give any direct information about whether or not the wug was garpled.\n\nAnswer: No",
