It states that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\n\nBased on these statements, we can make the following logical deductions:\n\n- If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\n- The fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nFrom these deductions, we can conclude that:\n\n- The fleeg was not bluttered, so it did not surn.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
