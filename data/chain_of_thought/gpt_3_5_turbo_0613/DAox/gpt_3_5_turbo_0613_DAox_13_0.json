However, we don't have any information about whether the glip was actually slogged or not.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot directly infer whether the glip was tragged or not. The statements only provide information about the glip not being slogged, but they do not provide any direct information about whether the glip was tragged or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
