It states that if the whiffle was shanked, then it tinked.\n\nBased on these statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- Since the whiffle was not shanked (as stated in the first statement), we cannot conclude anything about whether it tinked or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The whiffle did not tink\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
