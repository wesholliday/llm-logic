It states that if the sprocket was in a cranked state, then it was also in a daggled state.\n\nBased on these statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If the sprocket was cranked, then it was daggled (from the second statement).\n- The sprocket was not cranked (from the first statement).\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer whether the sprocket was daggled or not. The reason is that the second statement only establishes a relationship between cranked and daggled states, but it does not provide any information about the daggled state when the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The sprocket was not daggled\" from the given statements. \n\nAnswer: No",
