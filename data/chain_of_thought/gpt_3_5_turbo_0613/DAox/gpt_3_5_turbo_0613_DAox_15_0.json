It states that if the dreb was vroombed, then it was spened.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can make the following logical deductions:\n\n- If the dreb was vroombed, then it was spened (from statement 2).\n- But we know that the dreb was not vroombed (from statement 1).\n- Therefore, we cannot conclude anything about whether the dreb was spened or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
