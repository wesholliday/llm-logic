It states that the occurrence of the glunk snarbling will result in the blip being floinked.\n\nThe new statement \"If the glunk snarbles and the troon is zibbled, then the blip will be floinked\" introduces an additional condition, the troon being zibbled, along with the glunk snarbling. \n\nTo determine if we can infer the new statement from the original one, we need to consider if the original statement implies that the troon being zibbled is necessary for the blip to be floinked. \n\nSince the original statement only mentions the glunk snarbling as the condition for the blip being floinked, it does not provide any information about the troon being zibbled. Therefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: No",
