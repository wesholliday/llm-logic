In other words, we need to check if (P \u2192 Q) implies ((P \u2227 R) \u2192 Q).\n\nTo do this, we can use a truth table:\n\n| P | R | Q | (P \u2192 Q) | (P \u2227 R) | ((P \u2227 R) \u2192 Q) |\n|---|---|---|---------|---------|---------------|\n| T | T | T |    T    |    T    |       T       |\n| T | T | F |    F    |    T    |       F       |\n| T | F | T |    T    |    F    |       T       |\n| T | F | F |    F    |    F    |       T       |\n| F | T | T |    T    |    F    |       T       |\n| F | T | F |    T    |    F    |       T       |\n| F | F | T |    T    |    F    |       T       |\n| F | F | F |    T    |    F    |       T       |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that whenever (P \u2192 Q) is true, ((P \u2227 R) \u2192 Q) is also true. Therefore, we can infer the statement \"If the fribble is in the snarp and the snarp is flooping, then it is flugged\" from the given statement \"If the fribble is in the snarp, then it is flugged.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
