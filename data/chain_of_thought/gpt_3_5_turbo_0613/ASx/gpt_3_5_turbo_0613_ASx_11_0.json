Let's call this new condition C.\n\nTo infer the statement \"If the zibble is zapped and the quib is squinked, then the glorp will zoon,\" we need to determine if the original statement logically implies this new statement.\n\nIn order for the new statement to be true, both conditions A (the zibble being zapped) and C (the quib being squinked) must be true for the glorp to zoon.\n\nHowever, the original statement only tells us that if the zibble is zapped, then the glorp will zoon. It does not provide any information about the quib being squinked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If the zibble is zapped and the quib is squinked, then the glorp will zoon\" from the given statement \"If the zibble is zapped, then the glorp will zoon.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
