However, the given statement only provides information about the relationship between the krimp being in the zool and the snarf being glonked. It does not mention anything about the zool being zapped.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If the krimp is in the zool and the zool is zapped, then the snarf will be glonked\" from the given statement. \n\nAnswer: No",
