This means that crinking the snoogle is a sufficient condition for plooking a nurp.\n\nNow, let's consider Statement 2. It introduces an additional condition, which is \"a wug zites.\" The statement says that if we crink the snoogle and a wug zites, then we'll plook a nurp.\n\nBased on the information given, we cannot directly infer Statement 2 from Statement 1. The reason is that Statement 1 only establishes a relationship between crinking the snoogle and plooking a nurp. It does not provide any information about the relationship between a wug ziting and plooking a nurp.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
