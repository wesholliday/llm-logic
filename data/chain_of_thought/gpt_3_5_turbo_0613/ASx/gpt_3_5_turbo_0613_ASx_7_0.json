This means that the tizzer being on is a sufficient condition for the goom to be snurpled.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"If the tizzer is on and the plink light is out, then the goom is snurpled.\" This statement introduces an additional condition, which is the plink light being out. In order to infer this statement from the original statement, we need to determine if the plink light being out is necessary for the goom to be snurpled when the tizzer is on.\n\nIf the plink light being out is necessary for the goom to be snurpled when the tizzer is on, then we can infer the statement. However, if the plink light being out is not necessary for the goom to be snurpled when the tizzer is on, then we cannot infer the statement.\n\nTo make this determination, we need more information about the relationship between the plink light, the tizzer, and the goom. Without this additional information, we cannot make a definitive inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
