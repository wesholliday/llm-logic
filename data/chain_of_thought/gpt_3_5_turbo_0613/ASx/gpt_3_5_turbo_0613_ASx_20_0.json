It states that the occurrence of the plim being grobbled implies that the whiffle will sploosh.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"If the plim is grobbled and the drazzle is drooped, then the whiffle will sploosh.\" This statement introduces an additional condition, the drazzle being drooped, along with the plim being grobbled. \n\nTo infer this statement from the original statement, we need to ensure that the occurrence of both the plim being grobbled and the drazzle being drooped is necessary for the whiffle to sploosh. In other words, we need to determine if the original statement implies that the drazzle being drooped is a condition for the whiffle to sploosh.\n\nHowever, the original statement does not provide any information about the relationship between the drazzle and the whiffle. It only establishes a relationship between the plim and the whiffle. Therefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If the plim is grobbled and the drazzle is drooped, then the whiffle will sploosh\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
