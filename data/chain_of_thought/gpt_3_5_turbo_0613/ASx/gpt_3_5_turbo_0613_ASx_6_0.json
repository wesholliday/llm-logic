This statement does not provide any information about the presence or absence of \"plorks\" or the speaker wearing them.\n\nTherefore, we cannot directly infer the statement \"If you glurp and I am wearing plorks, it will hurt my snarfs\" from the given statement. The presence of \"plorks\" and the speaker wearing them is not mentioned or implied in the original statement.",
