It states that if the condition \"the glop is on the brink\" is true, then the consequence \"the skrizzle is plonked\" must also be true.\n\nThe new statement \"If the glop is on the brink and the bloop is zorped, then the skrizzle is plonked\" is also a conditional statement. It states that if both conditions \"the glop is on the brink\" and \"the bloop is zorped\" are true, then the consequence \"the skrizzle is plonked\" must also be true.\n\nTo determine if we can infer the new statement from the original statement, we need to consider if the original statement implies the new statement. In other words, if the original statement is true, does it necessarily mean that the new statement is also true?\n\nIn this case, we cannot infer the new statement from the original statement. The original statement only establishes a relationship between the glop being on the brink and the skrizzle being plonked. It does not provide any information about the bloop being zorped. Therefore, we cannot conclude that if the glop is on the brink and the bloop is zorped, then the skrizzle is plonked.\n\nAnswer: No",
