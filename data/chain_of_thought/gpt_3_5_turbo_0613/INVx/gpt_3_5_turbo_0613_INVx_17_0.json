The negation of P is \"The flob was not skizzled,\" and the negation of Q is \"The flob was not movated.\"\n\nSo, the inferred statement can be written as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ, which means \"If not P, then not Q.\"\n\nNow, we need to compare the original statement P \u2192 Q with the inferred statement \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ.\n\nIf we assume that the original statement is true, it means that whenever the flob is skizzled (P), it will always movate (Q). However, it does not tell us anything about what happens when the flob is not skizzled (\u00acP).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If the flob was not skizzled, then the flob was not movated\" from the original statement \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
