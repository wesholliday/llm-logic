So, the inverse of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not P, then not Q.\"\n\nTherefore, the inverse of the original statement would be \"If the sprocket was not cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled.\"\n\nNow, to determine if we can infer the inverse statement from the original statement, we need to consider the validity of the inference. In this case, the inference is not valid because the inverse statement may or may not be true.\n\nFor example, it is possible that the sprocket could be not cranked and still be daggled due to some other factor. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the sprocket was not cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled\" from \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
