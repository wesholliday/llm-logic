The negation of P \u2192 Q is \u00acP \u2228 Q.\n\nSo, the negation of \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\" is \"The glip was not slogged or the glip was tragged\".\n\nHowever, the statement \"If the glip was not slogged, then the glip was not tragged\" is the negation of the original statement, which is \u00ac(P \u2192 Q). The negation of P \u2192 Q is P \u2227 \u00acQ.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the glip was not slogged, then the glip was not tragged\" from \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\".\n\nAnswer: No",
