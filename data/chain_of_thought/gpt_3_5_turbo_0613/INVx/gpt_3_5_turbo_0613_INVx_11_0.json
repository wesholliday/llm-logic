In this case, A represents \"the flug was blummed\" and B represents \"the flug was zimmed.\"\n\nThe negation of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the antecedent (A) and the consequent (B). So, the negation of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\nTherefore, the negation of \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed\" would be \"If the flug was not blummed, then the flug was not zimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
