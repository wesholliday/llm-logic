This would result in:\n\n\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ\n\nwhere \u00acP represents \"the wug was not flooped\" and \u00acQ represents \"the wug did not bim the zoint.\"\n\nNow, we need to compare the original statement (P \u2192 Q) with the inferred statement (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ). If the inferred statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, then we can infer it.\n\nTo determine if the two statements are logically equivalent, we can use the contrapositive rule. The contrapositive of the original statement (P \u2192 Q) is:\n\n\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\nIf the contrapositive is equivalent to the inferred statement (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ), then we can infer the statement \"If the wug was not flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
