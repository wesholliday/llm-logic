The negation of P would be \"not P,\" which represents \"the splat was not morphed.\" The negation of Q would be \"not Q,\" which represents \"the splat did not quank.\"\n\nNow, we can rewrite the inferred statement as \"not P \u2192 not Q.\"\n\nTo determine if we can infer this statement, we need to check if it is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"P \u2192 Q\" is \"not Q \u2192 not P.\"\n\nComparing the inferred statement \"not P \u2192 not Q\" with the contrapositive \"not Q \u2192 not P,\" we can see that they are not the same. In the contrapositive, the negation of Q comes before the negation of P, while in the inferred statement, the negation of P comes before the negation of Q.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank\" from \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
