The negation of P is \"The clug was not fleeked,\" and the negation of Q is \"The clug was not snugged.\"\n\nSo, the inferred statement can be written as \"If not P, then not Q.\"\n\nNow, we need to compare the original statement \"If P, then Q\" with the inferred statement \"If not P, then not Q.\"\n\nIf the original statement and the inferred statement have the same logical structure, then we can infer the latter from the former.\n\nComparing the two statements, we can see that they have the same logical structure. In both cases, we have an \"If...then...\" form.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the clug was not fleeked, then the clug was not snugged\" from \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
