This is because the negation of a true statement is false.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the original statement is false, i.e., P -> Q is false, then the negation of the original statement (~P -> ~Q) could be either true or false. This is because the negation of a false statement can be either true or false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink\" from \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\" because the negation of the original statement does not necessarily hold true. \n\nAnswer: No",
