The negation of P would be \"not P\" (the smonk was not vreebled), and the negation of Q would be \"not Q\" (the smonk was not plagged).\n\nTherefore, the inferred statement would be \"not P \u2192 not Q,\" which translates to \"If the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk was not plagged.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
