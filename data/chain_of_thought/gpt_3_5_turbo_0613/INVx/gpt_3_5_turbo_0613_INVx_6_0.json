The negation of A would be \"the grommet was not sploffed,\" and the negation of B would be \"the grommet did not plop the frink.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if the negation of the original statement is a valid inference. To do this, we can consider a counterexample. If we can find a situation where the grommet was not sploffed but still plopped the frink, then the negation of the original statement would not hold.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the grommet was not sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
