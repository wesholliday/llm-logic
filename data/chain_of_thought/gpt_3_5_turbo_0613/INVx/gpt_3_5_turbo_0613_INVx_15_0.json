In this case, A represents \"the dreb was vroombed\" and B represents \"the dreb was spened.\"\n\nTo infer the negation of the original statement, we need to negate both the antecedent (A) and the consequent (B). The negation of \"the dreb was vroombed\" is \"the dreb was not vroombed,\" and the negation of \"the dreb was spened\" is \"the dreb was not spened.\"\n\nTherefore, the negation of the original statement would be \"If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
