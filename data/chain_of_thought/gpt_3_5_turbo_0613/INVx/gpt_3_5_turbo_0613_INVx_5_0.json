In this case, A represents \"the zinger was fraggled\" and B represents \"the zinger was smoogled.\"\n\nTo infer the negation of the original statement, we need to negate both the antecedent (A) and the consequent (B). The negation of \"the zinger was fraggled\" is \"the zinger was not fraggled,\" and the negation of \"the zinger was smoogled\" is \"the zinger was not smoogled.\"\n\nTherefore, the negation of the original statement would be \"If the zinger was not fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
