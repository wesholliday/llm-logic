In this case, P represents \"the flugel was blimmed\" and Q represents \"the flugel was zargled.\"\n\nThe negation of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the antecedent (P) and the consequent (Q). So, the negation of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not P, then not Q.\"\n\nIn this case, the negation of \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled\" would be \"If the flugel was not blimmed, then the flugel was not zargled.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
