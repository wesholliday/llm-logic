Negating \"If the shank was plooked\" gives us \"If the shank was not plooked,\" and negating \"the shank was nugged\" gives us \"the shank was not nugged.\"\n\nTherefore, the inferred statement would be:\n\nNot Plooked -> Not Nugged\n\nNow, we need to compare the inferred statement with the original statement to see if they are logically equivalent. If they have the same truth value in all cases, then we can infer one from the other.\n\nIn this case, the inferred statement \"Not Plooked -> Not Nugged\" is the contrapositive of the original statement \"Plooked -> Nugged.\" The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the shank was not plooked, then the shank was not nugged\" from \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
