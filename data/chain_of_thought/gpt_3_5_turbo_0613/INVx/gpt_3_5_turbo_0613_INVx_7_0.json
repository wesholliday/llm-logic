In this case, A represents \"the whiffle was shanked\" and B represents \"the whiffle tinked.\"\n\nThe negation of the original statement would be \"If the whiffle was not shanked, then the whiffle did not tink.\" This is the negation of both A and B.\n\nTo determine if the negation is a valid inference, we need to consider the truth values of the original statement and its negation. If the original statement is true, then its negation must be false, and vice versa.\n\nWithout any additional information about the relationship between shanking and tinkling, we cannot determine the truth value of the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the truth value of its negation.\n\nAnswer: No",
