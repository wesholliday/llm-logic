    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the main transportation options in a city. According to ridership data, Uber likely will have the most rides this month, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer rides. These are the only major transportation providers, so if Lyft doesn\u2019t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn\u2019t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides. Moreover, Uber likely will give the most rides and hence Lyft likely won\u2019t give the most rides. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Uber doesn\u2019t give the most rides, taxis will?",

            "content": "To determine if it's likely that if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will, we need to analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. According to ridership data, Uber is likely to have the most rides this month, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer rides.\n\n2. The statement also mentions that if Lyft doesn't give the most rides, then if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides.\n\n3. Additionally, it states that Uber is likely to give the most rides, and hence Lyft is likely not to give the most rides.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If Uber gives the most rides, then Lyft doesn't give the most rides.\n- If Lyft doesn't give the most rides, then if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides.\n\nTherefore, if Uber doesn't give the most rides, it is likely that taxis will give the most rides.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
