    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it\u2019s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn\u2019t get the offer, then if Priya doesn\u2019t, Diego will. Moreover, it\u2019s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn\u2019t get the offer, Diego will?",

The hiring manager thinks it's most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot.\n2. If Julian doesn't get the offer, then if Priya doesn't, Diego will.\n3. It's likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won't.\n\nBased on the given information, we can conclude the following:\n\n- It is likely that Priya will get the offer.\n- If Priya gets the offer, Julian won't.\n- If Julian doesn't get the offer, Diego will.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where Priya doesn't get the offer:\n\n- If Priya doesn't get the offer, Julian won't either (based on point 3).\n- If Julian doesn't get the offer, Diego will (based on point 2).\n\nTherefore, if Priya doesn't get the offer, it is likely that Diego will.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
