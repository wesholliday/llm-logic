    "user_prompt": "Suppose that banana bread, chocolate chip cookies, and carrot cake are the most popular baked goods. According to a consumer survey, it is very likely that banana bread will be the top seller, followed closely by chocolate chip cookies, with carrot cake far behind. These are the only top sellers, so if chocolate chip cookies aren\u2019t the top seller, then if banana bread isn\u2019t, carrot cake will be. Moreover, it is likely banana bread will be top and hence that chocolate chip cookies won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if banana bread isn\u2019t the top seller, carrot cake will be?",

According to the consumer survey, it is very likely that banana bread will be the top seller, followed closely by chocolate chip cookies, with carrot cake far behind.\n2. These are the only top sellers, so if chocolate chip cookies aren't the top seller, then if banana bread isn't, carrot cake will be.\n3. Moreover, it is likely banana bread will be top and hence that chocolate chip cookies won't be.\n\nBased on the given information, we can conclude that if banana bread isn't the top seller, then carrot cake will be. This is because if chocolate chip cookies aren't the top seller, and banana bread isn't the top seller, there are no other options left for the top seller, so it must be carrot cake.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Yes.",
