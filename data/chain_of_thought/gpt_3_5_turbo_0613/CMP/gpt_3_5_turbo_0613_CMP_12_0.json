Publishing data indicates thrillers will likely be the #1 genre this year, followed closely by romances, with mysteries far behind. These genres lead the market, so if romances aren\u2019t #1, then if thrillers aren\u2019t, mysteries will be. Moreover, thrillers likely will lead sales and hence romances likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if thrillers aren\u2019t #1, mysteries will be?",
