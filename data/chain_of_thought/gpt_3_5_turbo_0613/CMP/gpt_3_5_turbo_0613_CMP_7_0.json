    "user_prompt": "Suppose that tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources. Forecasts indicate it\u2019s likely tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. These are the only major sources, so if solar power doesn\u2019t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn\u2019t, wind power will. Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?",

            "content": "To determine if it's likely that if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will, we need to analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. Forecasts indicate that tidal power is likely to generate the most electricity this year.\n2. If tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, then wind power will.\n3. Moreover, tidal power is likely to generate the most electricity, and hence solar power likely won't.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If tidal power generates the most electricity, then wind power won't generate the most electricity.\n- If tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, then wind power will.\n\nTherefore, it follows that if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
