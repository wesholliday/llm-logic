    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",

            "content": "To determine if it is likely that if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers, we need to analyze the given information.\n\n1. Market research indicates that coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings.\n2. If tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n3. Coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nBased on the given information, we can conclude that if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, tea won't retain the most morning drinkers. However, this does not necessarily mean that soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nThe information provided does not directly state that if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will automatically become the most popular morning beverage. It only establishes a relationship between tea and coffee, not between coffee and soda.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that it is likely that if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nAnswer: No",
