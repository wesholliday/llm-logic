    "user_prompt": "Suppose that pizza, burgers, and tacos are the most frequently ordered takeout foods. According to restaurant data, pizza likely will be the top takeout item ordered, followed by burgers, with tacos ordered much less frequently. These foods lead takeout orders, so if burgers aren\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn\u2019t, tacos will be. Moreover, pizza likely will lead takeout orders and hence burgers likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if pizza isn\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be?",

            "content": "To determine if it's likely that if pizza isn't the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be, we need to analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. Pizza is likely to be the top takeout item ordered.\n2. Burgers are likely to be ordered after pizza.\n3. Tacos are ordered much less frequently than pizza and burgers.\n4. If burgers aren't the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn't, tacos will be.\n5. Pizza is likely to lead takeout orders, so burgers likely won't.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If pizza is the top takeout item ordered, then tacos won't be the top takeout item ordered because burgers are likely to be ordered after pizza.\n- If pizza isn't the top takeout item ordered, then tacos will be the top takeout item ordered because if burgers aren't the top item, tacos will be.\n\nTherefore, it is likely that if pizza isn't the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
