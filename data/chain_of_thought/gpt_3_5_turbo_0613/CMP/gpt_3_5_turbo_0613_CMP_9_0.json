    "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it\u2019s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be. Moreover, it\u2019s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",

            "content": "To determine if it is likely that if apples aren't the top-selling fruit, oranges will be, we need to analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. According to grocery store data, it's likely that apples will be the top-selling fruit this year.\n2. Bananas are expected to be the second top-selling fruit, closely following apples.\n3. Oranges are trailing distantly behind apples and bananas in terms of sales.\n4. If bananas aren't the top seller, then if apples aren't, oranges will be.\n\nBased on the given information, we can conclude that if apples aren't the top-selling fruit, bananas will be. This is because bananas are expected to closely follow apples in sales. However, there is no direct information or evidence to suggest that if apples aren't the top seller, oranges will be.\n\nTherefore, it does not follow that it is likely that if apples aren't the top-selling fruit, oranges will be.\n\nAnswer: No",
