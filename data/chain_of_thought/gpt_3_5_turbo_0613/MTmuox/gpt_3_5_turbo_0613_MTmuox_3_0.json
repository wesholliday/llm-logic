This means that the splat could have quanked or not quanked.\n\nStatement 2 introduces a conditional relationship between the splat being morphed and the splat quanking. It states that if the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked. This means that if the splat was not quanked, it cannot be morphed.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The splat was not morphed\"?\n\nAnswer: Yes. From the given statements, we can infer that the splat was not morphed.",
