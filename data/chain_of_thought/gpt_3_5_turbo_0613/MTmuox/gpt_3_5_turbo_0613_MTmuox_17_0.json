It states that if the flob was skizzled, then it must have been motivated.\n\nBased on these statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If the flob was skizzled, then it must have been motivated.\n- However, it is not necessary for the flob to have been motivated.\n\nFrom this reasoning, we can conclude that it is possible for the flob to have been skizzled without being motivated. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The flob was not skizzled\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
