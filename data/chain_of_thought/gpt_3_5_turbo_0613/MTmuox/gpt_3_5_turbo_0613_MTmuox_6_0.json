This means that there could be other possibilities for how the frink was plopped.\n\nStatement 2 introduces a conditional relationship. It states that if the grommet was sploffed, then it must have plopped the frink. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot directly infer whether the grommet was sploffed or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude \"The grommet was not sploffed.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
