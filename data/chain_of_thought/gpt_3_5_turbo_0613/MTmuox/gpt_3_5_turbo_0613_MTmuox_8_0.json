It states that if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n- If the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled (from statement 2).\n- It is not necessary for the sprocket to have been daggled (from statement 1).\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude whether the sprocket was cranked or not. The given information does not provide enough evidence to determine the status of whether the sprocket was cranked or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
