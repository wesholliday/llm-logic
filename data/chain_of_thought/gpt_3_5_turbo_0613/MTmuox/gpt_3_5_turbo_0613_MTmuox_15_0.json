This means that there is a possibility that the dreb was not spened.\n\nFrom statement 2, we have a conditional statement that states if the dreb was vroombed, then it must have been spened. This means that if the dreb was vroombed, it is necessary for it to have been spened.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The dreb was not vroombed\"?\n\nTo answer this, we need to determine if there is any contradiction between the two statements. If there is a contradiction, then we can infer that the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nLooking at the statements, we can see that there is no direct contradiction. Statement 1 does not provide any information about whether the dreb was vroombed or not. Statement 2 only tells us that if the dreb was vroombed, it must have been spened.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The dreb was not vroombed\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
