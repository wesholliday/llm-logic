If the clug was fleeked, then it must have been snugged.\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications:\n\n- If the clug was snugged, it satisfies the condition in statement 2. However, statement 1 tells us that it is not necessary for the clug to have been snugged. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the clug was snugged.\n\n- If the clug was fleeked, it would imply that it was snugged based on statement 2. However, we cannot conclude that the clug was fleeked because there is no information given about whether it was fleeked or not.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot infer whether \"The clug was not fleeked\" is true or false.",
