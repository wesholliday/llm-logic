It states that if the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n- If the twonk must have been varnished, it means that it is necessary for the twonk to have been varnished. However, the first statement tells us that it is not the case.\n\n- The second statement establishes a conditional relationship between being plinked and being varnished. It does not provide any information about whether the twonk was actually plinked or not.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot directly infer whether the twonk was plinked or not. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
