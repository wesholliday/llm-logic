This means that the zinger could have been smoogled or not smoogled.\n\nFrom statement 2, we have a conditional statement that states if the zinger was fraggled, then it must have been smoogled. This means that if the zinger was fraggled, it is necessary for it to have been smoogled.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that if the zinger was fraggled, it must have been smoogled. However, we cannot determine whether the zinger was fraggled or not based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The zinger was not fraggled\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
