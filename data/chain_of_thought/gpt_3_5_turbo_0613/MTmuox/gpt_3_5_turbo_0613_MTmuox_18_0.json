It states that if the shank was plooked, then it must have been nugged.\n\nBased on these statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If the shank was plooked, then it must have been nugged.\n- However, it is not necessary for the shank to have been nugged.\n\nFrom this reasoning, we can conclude that it is possible for the shank to have been plooked without being nugged. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The shank was not plooked\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
