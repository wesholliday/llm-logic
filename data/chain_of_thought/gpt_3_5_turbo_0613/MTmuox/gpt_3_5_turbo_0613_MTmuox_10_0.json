This means that the wug could have been garpled or not garpled.\n\nStatement 2 introduces a conditional relationship between being sproinged and being garpled. It states that if the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled. This means that if the wug was sproinged, it is guaranteed to have been garpled.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The wug was not sproinged\"?\n\nTo answer this, we need to examine the given statements. Statement 1 does not provide any information about whether the wug was sproinged or not. However, statement 2 tells us that if the wug was sproinged, it must have been garpled.\n\nSince we don't have any information that directly addresses whether the wug was sproinged or not, we cannot infer \"The wug was not sproinged\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
