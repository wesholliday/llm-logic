It states that if the sneg was crampled, then it must have sproted the frink.\n\nBased on these statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If the sneg was crampled, then it must have sproted the frink.\n- However, it is not necessary for the sneg to have sproted the frink.\n\nFrom this reasoning, we can conclude that the sneg was not crampled. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
