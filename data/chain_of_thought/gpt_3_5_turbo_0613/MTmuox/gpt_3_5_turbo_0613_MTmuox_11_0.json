It states that if the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed.\n\nBased on these statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed.\n- It is not necessary for the flug to have been zimmed.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude whether the flug was blummed or not. The given information does not provide enough evidence to determine the status of the flug being blummed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The flug was not blummed\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
