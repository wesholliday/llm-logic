In other words, it is possible for the glip to not have tragged.\n\n2. \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged.\"\n   This statement establishes a conditional relationship. It states that if the glip was slogged, then it must have tragged.\n\nBased on these statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If the glip was slogged, then it must have tragged.\n- However, it is not necessary for the glip to have tragged.\n\nFrom this reasoning, we can conclude that it is possible for the glip to have been slogged without having tragged. Therefore, we can infer that \"The glip was not slogged.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
