This means that the smonk could have plagged or not plagged.\n\nStatement 2 introduces a conditional relationship between being vreebled and plagged. It states that if the smonk was vreebled, then it must have plagged. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot directly infer whether the smonk was vreebled or not. The statements only provide information about the relationship between plagging and being vreebled, but not about the actual state of the smonk being vreebled.\n\nAnswer: No",
