It states that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\n\nBased on these statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\n- It is not necessary for the fleeg to have been surned.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude whether the fleeg was bluttered or not. The given information does not provide enough evidence to determine the status of the fleeg being bluttered.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
