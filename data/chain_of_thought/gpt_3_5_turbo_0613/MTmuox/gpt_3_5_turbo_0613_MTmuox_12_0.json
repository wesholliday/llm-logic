It states that if the smip was shripped, then it must have lupped the zoint.\n\nBased on these statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If the smip was shripped, then it must have lupped the zoint.\n- However, it is not necessary for the smip to have lupped the zoint.\n\nFrom this reasoning, we can conclude that the smip was not shripped. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
