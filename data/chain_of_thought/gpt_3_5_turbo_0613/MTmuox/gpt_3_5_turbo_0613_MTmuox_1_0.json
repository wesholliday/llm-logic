It states that if the flugel was blimmed, then it must have been zargled.\n\nBased on these statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If the flugel was blimmed, then it must have been zargled.\n- However, it is not necessary for the flugel to have been zargled.\n\nFrom this reasoning, we can conclude that it is possible for the flugel to have been blimmed without being zargled. Therefore, we can infer that \"The flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
