It states that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned. However, we do not have any information about whether the fleeg was actually bluttered or not. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The fleeg surned.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
