It states that if the flug was blummed, then it was also zimmed.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can make the following logical deductions:\n\n- If the flug was blummed, then it was zimmed (from the second statement).\n- We know that the flug was blummed (from the first statement).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The flug was zimmed\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
