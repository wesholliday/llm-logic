Statement 1: \"The fribble was snurgled.\"\n   This statement tells us that the fribble underwent snurgling.\n\n2. Statement 2: \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\"\n   This statement establishes a conditional relationship between snurgling and crinking. It states that if the fribble was snurgled, then it crinked.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can make the following logical deductions:\n\n- If the fribble was snurgled (Statement 1), then the fribble crinked (Statement 2).\n- We know that the fribble was snurgled (Statement 1).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The fribble crinked'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
