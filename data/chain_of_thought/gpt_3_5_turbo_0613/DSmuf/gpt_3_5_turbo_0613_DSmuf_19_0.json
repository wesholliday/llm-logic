It states that the watch must be either on his wrist or charging on the dresser. Since we know that the watch is not on his wrist, the only remaining possibility is that it is charging on the dresser.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The watch is charging on the dresser.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
