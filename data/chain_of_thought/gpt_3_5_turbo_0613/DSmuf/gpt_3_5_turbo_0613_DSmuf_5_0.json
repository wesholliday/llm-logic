This statement establishes that the cookies are in one of these two locations.\n\nStatement 2 negates the possibility that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry. This means that the cookies cannot be exclusively in the pantry.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the cookies must be in the jar because it is the only remaining possibility.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
