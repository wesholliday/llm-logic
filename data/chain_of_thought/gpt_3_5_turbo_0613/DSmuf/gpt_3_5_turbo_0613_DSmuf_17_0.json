The statement \"Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack\" suggests that there are only two possibilities for the location of the scarf: either on the coat rack or in the backpack.\n\n2. The statement \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack\" implies that the first possibility (the scarf being on the coat rack) is not true.\n\n3. If the first possibility is not true, then the only remaining possibility is that the scarf is in the backpack.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can infer that \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
