It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that the book is either on the table or on the shelf. This is because the word \"either\" indicates that one of the two options must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not true that the book must be resting on the table. This means that the book cannot be on the table.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that the book must be on the shelf. This is because if it is not on the table, the only remaining option is for it to be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
