It does not provide any specific information about Fido's location.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n   This statement negates the possibility that Fido must be in the garden. It tells us that Fido is not necessarily in the garden.\n\nBased on the given information, we can conclude that Fido is inside. This is because if Fido is not required to be in the garden and the only other option is being inside, then Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
