It tells us that the cat is not necessarily playing in the bedroom.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that the only remaining possibility is that \"the cat is napping on the couch.\" Since the first statement states that one of the two options must be true and the second statement eliminates one of the options, the only option left is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
