It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that one of two possibilities is true: either the jacket is hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it is not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet. This means that the first possibility mentioned in statement 1 (the jacket hanging in the closet) is not true.\n\nTherefore, the only remaining possibility is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
