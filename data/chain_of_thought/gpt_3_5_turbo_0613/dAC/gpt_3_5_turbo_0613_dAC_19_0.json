It states that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This does not provide any direct information about whether Tom actually watched football or not.\n\nThe second statement, \"Jen watched basketball,\" tells us that Jen watched basketball. This statement does not provide any information about Tom's activities.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot deduce whether Tom watched football or not. The second statement does not provide any direct information about Tom's actions, and the first statement only establishes a relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball, but it does not confirm that Tom actually watched football.\n\nAnswer: No",
