If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\n2. Kate ate salad.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that Kate eating salad satisfies the condition in the first statement. However, we cannot definitively conclude that Ben ate pasta based on this information alone. It is possible that Kate ate salad for some other reason unrelated to Ben eating pasta. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
