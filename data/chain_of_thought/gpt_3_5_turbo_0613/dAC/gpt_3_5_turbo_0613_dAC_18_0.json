It establishes a relationship between the doll and the truck. It states that if the doll is made of plastic, then the truck is made of metal. \n\nThe second statement, \"The truck was metal,\" provides information about the truck's material. It tells us that the truck is made of metal. \n\nTo deduce that the doll was plastic, we need to consider the logical implications of the given statements. \n\nIf the doll is made of plastic, then the truck is made of metal. \nThe truck is made of metal. \n\nFrom these statements, we can conclude that if the truck is made of metal, then the doll must be made of plastic. This is because the first statement establishes a direct relationship between the doll being plastic and the truck being metal. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: Yes, we can deduce that the doll was plastic.",
