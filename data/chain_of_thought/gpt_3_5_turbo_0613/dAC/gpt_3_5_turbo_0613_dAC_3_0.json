However, this does not necessarily mean that James is the only author who writes mystery novels. There could be other authors who also write mystery novels.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the book in question is a mystery novel. This aligns with the condition stated in statement 1, but it does not provide any direct information about the author.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot definitively deduce that the book was written by James. There could be other authors who write mystery novels, and statement 2 alone does not provide any information about the authorship.",
