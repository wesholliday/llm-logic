It states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This means that if Alex did not finish the race, we cannot conclude anything about Chris.\n\nThe second statement, \"Chris finished the race,\" tells us that Chris indeed finished the race. However, it does not provide any information about Alex.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot deduce whether Alex finished the race or not. The information provided is not sufficient to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No",
