However, this does not necessarily mean that the cat cannot be outside when the dog is not inside. It only establishes a relationship between the dog being inside and the cat being outside.\n\nFrom statement 2, we are given the information that the cat was indeed outside. This aligns with the condition stated in statement 1, but it does not provide any information about the dog's location.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot deduce whether the dog was inside or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
