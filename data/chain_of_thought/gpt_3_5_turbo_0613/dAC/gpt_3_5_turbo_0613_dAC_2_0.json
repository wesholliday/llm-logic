This is because the statement establishes a conditional relationship between the griffin and the unicorn.\n\nNow, let's consider Statement 2. It tells us that the unicorn was indeed in the forest. \n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that if the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin must have also been in the forest. This is because Statement 1 establishes a logical connection between the presence of the griffin and the presence of the unicorn.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
