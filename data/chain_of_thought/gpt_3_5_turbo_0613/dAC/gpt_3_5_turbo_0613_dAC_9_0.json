It suggests that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. \n\nThe second statement, \"Mark bought the blue shirt,\" is a separate piece of information.\n\nBased on this information, we can make the following deductions:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n2. Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt based on this information alone. The first statement only establishes a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. It does not provide any direct information about Lisa's purchase.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
