However, it does not tell us anything about what happens when the bear is not in the cave. \n\nIf the second statement is true, it means that the wolf was indeed in the den. \n\nBased on the given information, we cannot deduce that the bear was in the cave. The first statement only tells us what happens when the bear is in the cave, but it does not provide any information about what happens when the bear is not in the cave. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive conclusion about the bear's location. \n\nAnswer: No",
