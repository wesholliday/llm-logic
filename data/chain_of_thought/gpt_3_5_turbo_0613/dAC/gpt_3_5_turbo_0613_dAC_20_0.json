However, this does not necessarily mean that the apple must be red. It only establishes a conditional relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the banana was indeed yellow. This information does not provide any direct evidence about the color of the apple.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot deduce that \"The apple was red.\"",
