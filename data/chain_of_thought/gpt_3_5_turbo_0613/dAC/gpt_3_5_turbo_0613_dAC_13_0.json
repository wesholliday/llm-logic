However, this does not necessarily mean that the car must be red if the truck is blue. It only establishes a conditional relationship between the car being red and the truck being blue.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement. It tells us that the truck was blue. This information does not provide any direct information about the color of the car.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot deduce that \"The car was red\" with certainty.",
