            "content": "To determine if we can deduce that Mary was at the wedding, we need to analyze the given statements. \n\nThe first statement, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" is a conditional statement. It states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. This does not provide any information about whether Mary was actually at the wedding or not.\n\nThe second statement, \"Sue was at the wedding,\" tells us that Sue was indeed present at the wedding. However, this statement does not provide any direct information about Mary's presence at the wedding.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot deduce whether Mary was at the wedding or not. The first statement only establishes a relationship between Mary and Sue, but it does not provide any information about Mary's actual presence at the wedding. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Mary was at the wedding based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
