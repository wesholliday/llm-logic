It states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. \n\nThe second statement, 'Mark bought the blue shirt,' is a simple statement that tells us that Mark did indeed buy the blue shirt. \n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that Mark bought the blue shirt. However, we cannot definitively determine whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not. The first statement only establishes a condition, but it does not provide any information about whether Lisa actually bought the red shirt. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
