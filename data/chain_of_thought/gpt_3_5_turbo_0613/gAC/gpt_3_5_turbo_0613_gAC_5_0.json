This statement does not provide any information about whether Jeff actually played basketball or not. It only establishes a conditional relationship between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis.\n\nThe second statement, 'Amy played tennis', tells us that Amy did indeed play tennis. This statement does not provide any direct information about whether Jeff played basketball or not.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude whether Jeff played basketball or not. The fact that Amy played tennis does not necessarily imply that Jeff played basketball. It is possible that Jeff did not play basketball, even though Amy played tennis.\n\nAnswer: No",
