The statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is a conditional statement. It establishes a relationship between Sue choosing pizza and Bob choosing pasta. It does not provide any information about whether Sue actually chose pizza or not.\n\n2. The statement \"Bob chose pasta\" is a separate statement that tells us that Bob did choose pasta. It does not provide any information about Sue's choice.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude whether Sue chose pizza or not. The fact that Bob chose pasta does not necessarily mean that Sue chose pizza. It is possible that Sue chose pizza, but it is also possible that she chose something else.\n\nAnswer: No",
