This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\" In this case, A represents \"the apple was red\" and B represents \"the banana was yellow.\" \n\nWe are also given that 'The banana was yellow' is true. \n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the condition for the conditional statement is satisfied. The banana was indeed yellow, which means that A (the apple was red) is true. \n\nTherefore, the statement 'The apple was red' is true. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
