This is a conditional statement, where the griffin being in the forest is the condition and the unicorn being in the forest is the result. \n\nWe are also given that 'The unicorn was in the forest' is true. \n\nFrom these two pieces of information, we can conclude that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. Since we know that the unicorn was indeed in the forest, it is possible that the griffin was also in the forest. \n\nTherefore, the statement 'The griffin was in the forest' is true. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
