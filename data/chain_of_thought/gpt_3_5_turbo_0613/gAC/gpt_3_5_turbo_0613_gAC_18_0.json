However, this does not tell us anything about the doll if the truck is metal. It only establishes a relationship between the doll being plastic and the truck being metal.\n\nFrom Statement B, we know that the truck is metal. This information does not provide any direct information about the doll.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude whether the doll was plastic or not. \n\nAnswer: No",
