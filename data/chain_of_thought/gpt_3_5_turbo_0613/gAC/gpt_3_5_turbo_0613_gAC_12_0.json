This statement does not provide any information about whether Joe actually went to the park or not. It only establishes a conditional relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo.\n\nThe second statement, 'Lucy went to the zoo,' tells us that Lucy did indeed go to the zoo. This statement does not provide any information about Joe going to the park.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude whether Joe went to the park or not. The fact that Lucy went to the zoo does not necessarily imply that Joe went to the park. It is possible that Joe went to the park, but it is also possible that he did not. Therefore, the statement 'Joe went to the park' cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
