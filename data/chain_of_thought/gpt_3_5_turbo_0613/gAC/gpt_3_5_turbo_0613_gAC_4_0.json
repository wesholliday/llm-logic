This means that the robot's visit to Jupiter is dependent on the alien's visit to Mars.\n\nFrom statement B, we are told that the robot visited Jupiter. This statement does not provide any information about the alien's visit to Mars.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude whether the alien visited Mars or not. The robot's visit to Jupiter does not necessarily imply that the alien visited Mars. Therefore, the statement 'The alien visited Mars' cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
