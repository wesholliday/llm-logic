This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\" In this case, A represents \"Alex finished the race\" and B represents \"Chris finished the race.\" \n\nWe are also given that 'Chris finished the race' is true. \n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that if the condition (A) is true, then the result (B) must also be true. Since we know that B is true (Chris finished the race), it does not provide any information about the truth value of A (Alex finished the race). \n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively say whether Alex finished the race based on the given information. \n\nAnswer: No",
