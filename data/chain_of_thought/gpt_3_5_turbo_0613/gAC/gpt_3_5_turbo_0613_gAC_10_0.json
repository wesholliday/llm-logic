It states that whenever the dog is inside, the cat is outside. \n\nWe are also given the information that \"The cat was outside,\" which means that the cat was indeed outside. \n\nBased on these two pieces of information, we can conclude that the dog must have been inside. This is because the conditional statement tells us that whenever the dog is inside, the cat is outside. Since the cat was outside, it implies that the dog must have been inside. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: yes.",
