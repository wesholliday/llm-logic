This is a conditional statement, where the bear being in the cave is the condition and the wolf being in the den is the result. \n\nWe are also given that 'The wolf was in the den' is true. \n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the condition of the conditional statement is true (the wolf was in the den). \n\nIn a true conditional statement, if the condition is true, then the result must also be true. Therefore, if the wolf was in the den (which is true), it follows that the bear was in the cave. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
