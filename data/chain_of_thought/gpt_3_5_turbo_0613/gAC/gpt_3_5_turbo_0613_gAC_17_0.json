This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\" In this case, A represents \"Ben ate pasta\" and B represents \"Kate ate salad.\" \n\nWe are also given that 'Kate ate salad' is true. \n\nTo determine if 'Ben ate pasta' is true, we need to check if the condition (A) is satisfied. Since we know that B (Kate ate salad) is true, it does not provide any information about whether A (Ben ate pasta) is true or false. \n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude whether Ben ate pasta or not. \n\nAnswer: No",
