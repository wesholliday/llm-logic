This statement does not provide any information about what happens if the shirt is not made of cotton.\n\nThe second statement, 'The pants were denim,' tells us that the pants are indeed made of denim.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively conclude whether the shirt is made of cotton or not. It is possible that the shirt is made of cotton, as stated in the first statement, but it is also possible that the shirt is made of a different material. Therefore, we cannot say for certain that 'The shirt was cotton' is true.\n\nAnswer: No",
