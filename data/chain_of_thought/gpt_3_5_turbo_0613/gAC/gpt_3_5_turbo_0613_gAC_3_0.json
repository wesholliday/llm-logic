This statement does not provide any information about whether James is the actual author or not.\n\nThe second statement, 'The book is a mystery novel,' tells us that the book is indeed a mystery novel. This statement does not provide any information about the author of the book.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that 'The book was written by James' is true. The information provided does not establish a direct link between James being the author and the book being a mystery novel. It is possible that James is the author, but it is also possible that someone else wrote the book. Therefore, we cannot determine the truthfulness of the statement 'The book was written by James' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
