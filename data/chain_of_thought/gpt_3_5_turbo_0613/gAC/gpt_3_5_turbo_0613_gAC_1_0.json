This statement does not provide any information about whether Mary was actually at the wedding or not. It only establishes a relationship between Mary and Sue's presence.\n\nThe second statement, 'Sue was at the wedding', tells us that Sue was indeed present at the wedding. This statement does not provide any direct information about Mary's presence or absence at the wedding.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude whether Mary was at the wedding or not. The fact that Sue was at the wedding does not necessarily imply that Mary was also present. It is possible that Mary was not at the wedding, even though Sue was there.\n\nAnswer: No",
