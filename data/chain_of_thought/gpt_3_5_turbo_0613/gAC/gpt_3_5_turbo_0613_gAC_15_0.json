It states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. \n\nThe second statement, 'Erin took a train', is a separate piece of information that we are given. \n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that Erin took a train. However, we cannot definitively determine whether Sam took a plane or not. The first statement only establishes a relationship between Sam taking a plane and Erin taking a train, but it does not provide any information about whether Sam actually took a plane or not. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: no.",
