It states that whenever the vampire is awake, the mummy is also awake. \n\nWe are also given the information that \"The mummy was awake,\" which means that the mummy is indeed awake. \n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively conclude whether the vampire is awake or not. The conditional statement only tells us that if the vampire is awake, the mummy is awake, but it does not provide any information about the vampire's state when the mummy is awake. \n\nTherefore, we cannot determine whether the vampire is awake or not based solely on the given information. \n\nAnswer: No",
