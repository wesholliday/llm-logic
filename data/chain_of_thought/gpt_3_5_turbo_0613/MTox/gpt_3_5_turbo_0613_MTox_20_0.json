We don't have any additional information about the fleeg's bluttered status.\n\n2. \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\": This statement establishes a conditional relationship between the fleeg being bluttered and it surning. If the fleeg is bluttered, then it surns.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot directly infer whether the fleeg was bluttered or not. The first statement does not provide any information about the fleeg's bluttered status, and the second statement only establishes a conditional relationship between bluttered and surning.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The fleeg was not bluttered\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
