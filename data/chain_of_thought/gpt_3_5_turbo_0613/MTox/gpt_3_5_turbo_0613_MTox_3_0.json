It does not provide any information about whether the splat was morphed or not.\n\n2. \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" - This statement establishes a conditional relationship. It states that if the splat was morphed, then it quanked. However, it does not provide any information about whether the splat was actually morphed or not.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot directly infer whether \"The splat was not morphed\" or not. The information provided does not give us any conclusive evidence about the morphing status of the splat.\n\nAnswer: No",
