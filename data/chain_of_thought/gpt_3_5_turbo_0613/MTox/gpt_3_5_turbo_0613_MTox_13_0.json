It states that if the glip was slogged, then it was tragged.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n- If the glip was not tragged (as stated in the first statement), it means that the condition in the second statement (\"the glip was slogged\") is not satisfied. In other words, if the glip was not tragged, it cannot be slogged.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer that \"The glip was not slogged.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
