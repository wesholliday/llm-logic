However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot directly infer whether the sprocket was cranked or not. The statements only tell us that the sprocket was not daggled, but they do not provide any conclusive information about whether it was cranked or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
