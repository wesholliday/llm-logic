It states that if the whiffle was shanked, it would make a tink sound.\n\nBased on these statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If the whiffle did not tink, it means that the condition for it to make a tink sound was not met.\n- The condition for the whiffle to make a tink sound is being shanked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The whiffle was not shanked.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
