We don't have any information about whether the smonk was vreebled or not.\n\n2. \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged\" - This statement establishes a conditional relationship. It states that if the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged. However, it does not provide any information about whether the smonk was actually vreebled or not.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot directly infer whether \"The smonk was not vreebled\" or not. The statements do not provide enough information to make a conclusive inference about the vreebling status of the smonk.\n\nAnswer: No",
