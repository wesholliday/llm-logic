It states that if the grommet was sploffed, then it plopped the frink.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n- If the grommet did not plop the frink, it means that the condition in the second statement (\"the grommet plopped the frink\") is false. This means that the antecedent of the conditional statement (\"the grommet was sploffed\") must also be false for the entire statement to be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The grommet was not sploffed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
