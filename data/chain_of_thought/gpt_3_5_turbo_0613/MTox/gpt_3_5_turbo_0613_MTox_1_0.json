It states that if the flugel was blimmed, then it was zargled.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n- If the flugel was blimmed, then it was zargled (from the second statement).\n- But we know that the flugel was not zargled (from the first statement).\n\nBased on these two pieces of information, we can conclude that the flugel was not blimmed. This is because if the flugel were blimmed, it would have been zargled, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
