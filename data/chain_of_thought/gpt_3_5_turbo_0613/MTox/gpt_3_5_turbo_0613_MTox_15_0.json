It states that if the dreb was vroombed, then it was spened.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n- If the dreb was not spened (as stated in the first statement), it means that the condition in the second statement (\"the dreb was vroombed\") was not met. This is because the second statement says that if the dreb was vroombed, then it was spened.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
