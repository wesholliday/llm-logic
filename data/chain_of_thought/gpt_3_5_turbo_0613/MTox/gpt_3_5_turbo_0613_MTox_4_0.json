It states that if the fribble was snurgled, then it crinked.\n\nBased on these statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If the fribble did not crink, it means that the condition mentioned in the second statement (\"the fribble was snurgled\") did not occur. This is because the second statement states that if the fribble was snurgled, it crinked. Since the fribble did not crink, we can conclude that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
