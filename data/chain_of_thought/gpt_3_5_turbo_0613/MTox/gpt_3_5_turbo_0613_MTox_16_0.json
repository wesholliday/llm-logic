It states that if the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If the sneg sproted the frink, it means the sneg was crampled (based on the second statement).\n- However, the first statement tells us that the sneg did not sprot the frink.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can conclude that we cannot infer \"The sneg was not crampled\" from the given statements.",
