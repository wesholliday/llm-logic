It states that if the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n- If the smip did not lup the zoint, it means that the condition in the second statement (\"the smip lupped the zoint\") did not occur.\n\n- Since the second statement is a conditional statement, the only way for the condition to not occur is if the antecedent (\"the smip was shripped\") is false.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The smip was not shripped.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
