It states that if the zinger was fraggled, then it was smoogled.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n- If the zinger was not smoogled (as stated in the first statement), then the conditional statement in the second statement does not apply. In this case, we cannot conclude anything about whether the zinger was fraggled or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer \"The zinger was not fraggled.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
