It states that if the flug was blummed, then it was zimmed.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n- If the flug was blummed, then it was zimmed. This is stated in the second statement.\n\n- However, the first statement tells us that the flug was not zimmed.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that the flug was not blummed. This is because if the flug had been blummed, it would have also been zimmed according to the second statement. But since the first statement tells us that the flug was not zimmed, it means that the condition for being blummed was not met.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The flug was not blummed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
