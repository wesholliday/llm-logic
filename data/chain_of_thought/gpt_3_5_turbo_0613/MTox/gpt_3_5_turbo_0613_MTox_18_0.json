It states that if the shank was plooked, then it was nugged.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n- If the shank was not nugged (as stated in the first statement), then we cannot conclude anything about whether it was plooked or not. The first statement does not provide any information about the plooked condition.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The shank was not plooked.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
