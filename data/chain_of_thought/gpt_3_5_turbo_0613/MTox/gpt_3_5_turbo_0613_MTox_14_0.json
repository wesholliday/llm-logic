We don't have any information about whether the clug was fleeked or not.\n\n2. \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\" - This statement establishes a conditional relationship. It states that if the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the clug was not fleeked.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot directly infer whether \"The clug was not fleeked\" is true or not. The information provided does not give us enough evidence to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No",
