It states that if the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can make the following deductions:\n\n- If the wug was garpled, then it must have been sproinged because of the conditional relationship mentioned in statement 2.\n- However, we know from statement 1 that the wug was not garpled.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the wug was not sproinged because if it were sproinged, it would have been garpled, which contradicts statement 1.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that \"The wug was not sproinged.\"",
