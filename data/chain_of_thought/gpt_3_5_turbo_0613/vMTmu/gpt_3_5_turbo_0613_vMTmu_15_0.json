            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. This can be represented as: P \u2192 Q, where P represents \"Sam took a plane\" and Q represents \"Erin must have taken a train\".\n\nThe second premise states that it is not the case that Erin must have taken a train. This can be represented as: \u00acQ.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is \"Sam did not take a plane\", which can be represented as: \u00acP.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. In this case, we can use a valid form of inference called Modus Tollens.\n\nModus Tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ), then we can infer the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP).\n\nApplying Modus Tollens to the premises, we have:\n1. P \u2192 Q (If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train)\n2. \u00acQ (It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train)\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer:\n3. \u00acP (Sam did not take a plane)\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
