            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\nPremise 1: If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\nPremise 2: It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\nConclusion: The book was not written by James.\n\nTo evaluate the validity, we can use a technique called modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that states if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, then we can conclude that A must also be false.\n\nIn this case, the argument follows the form of modus tollens:\n\nIf A (the book was written by James), then B (the book must be a mystery novel).\nNot B (it's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel).\nTherefore, not A (the book was not written by James).\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
