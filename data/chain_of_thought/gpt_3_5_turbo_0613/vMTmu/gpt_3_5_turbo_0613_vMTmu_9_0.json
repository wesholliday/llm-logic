Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\nPremise 1: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\nPremise 2: It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nFrom these premises, we can see that if the first premise is true, and the second premise is also true, then it follows that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This is because if Lisa bought the red shirt, it would imply that Mark bought the blue shirt, which contradicts the second premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
