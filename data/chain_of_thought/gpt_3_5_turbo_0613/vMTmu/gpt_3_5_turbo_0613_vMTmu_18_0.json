            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. This can be represented as: P \u2192 Q, where P represents \"the doll was plastic\" and Q represents \"the truck must have been metal\".\n\nThe second premise states that it is not the case that the truck must have been metal. This can be represented as: \u00acQ.\n\nThe conclusion states that the doll was not plastic. This can be represented as: \u00acP.\n\nTo determine if the conclusion follows logically from the premises, we need to check if the premises logically imply the conclusion. In this case, we can use a method called modus tollens.\n\nModus tollens is a valid logical inference rule that states: If P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then \u00acP.\n\nApplying modus tollens to the premises, we have:\n\nPremise 1: P \u2192 Q\nPremise 2: \u00acQ\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can conclude:\n\nConclusion: \u00acP\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
