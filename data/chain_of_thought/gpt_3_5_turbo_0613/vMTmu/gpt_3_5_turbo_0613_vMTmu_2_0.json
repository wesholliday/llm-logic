This can be represented as: \nP1: Griffin in forest \u2192 Unicorn in forest\n\nThe second premise states that it is not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest. This can be represented as the negation of the first premise: \nP2: \u00ac(Griffin in forest \u2192 Unicorn in forest)\n\nThe conclusion states that the griffin was not in the forest: \nC: \u00ac(Griffin in forest)\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, we need to check if the premises logically entail the conclusion.\n\nBy analyzing the logical structure of the argument, we can see that the conclusion is not directly derived from the premises. The premises do not provide enough information to conclude that the griffin was not in the forest. The argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
