            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. This can be represented as: \nP1: If A, then B.\n\nThe second premise states that it is not the case that the truck must have been blue. This can be represented as the negation of the first premise:\nP2: It is not the case that B.\n\nThe conclusion is that the car was not red. This can be represented as the negation of the antecedent of the first premise:\nC: It is not the case that A.\n\nTo determine if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises, we can use a method called modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that states if we have a conditional statement (if A, then B) and the consequent (B) is false, then we can conclude that the antecedent (A) must also be false.\n\nIn this case, the second premise states that it is not the case that B (the truck must have been blue). Applying modus tollens, we can conclude that the antecedent (A) must also be false, which means the car was not red.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
