            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\nPremise 1: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\nPremise 2: It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\n\nFrom these premises, we can see that if Sue must have been at the wedding, then Mary must have been at the wedding. However, the second premise states that Sue must not have been at the wedding. \n\nGiven this information, we cannot definitively conclude whether Mary was or was not at the wedding. The argument does not provide enough information to establish a direct relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's absence.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
