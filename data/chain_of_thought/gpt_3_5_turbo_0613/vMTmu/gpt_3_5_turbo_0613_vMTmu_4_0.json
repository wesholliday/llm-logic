Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\nPremise 1: If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\nPremise 2: It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter.\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer the following:\n\nIf the robot did not visit Jupiter, then it is not the case that the alien visited Mars.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly conclude that the alien did not visit Mars. The argument only establishes a conditional relationship between the robot visiting Jupiter and the alien visiting Mars. It does not provide any information about whether the robot visited Jupiter or not.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
