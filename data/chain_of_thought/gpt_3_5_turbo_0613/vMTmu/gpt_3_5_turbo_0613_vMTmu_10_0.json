            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside. This can be represented as: \nP1: If A, then B.\n\nThe second premise states that it is not the case that the cat must have been outside. This can be represented as:\nP2: Not B.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is that the dog was not inside. This can be represented as:\nC: Not A.\n\nTo evaluate the validity of the argument, we can use a method called modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that states if we have a conditional statement (if A, then B) and the consequent (B) is false, then we can conclude that the antecedent (A) must also be false.\n\nIn this case, the argument follows the form of modus tollens. If we assume that the premises are true, and the cat must not have been outside (P2: Not B), then we can conclude that the dog was not inside (C: Not A).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
