            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. This can be represented as: Jeff played basketball \u2192 Amy played tennis.\n\nThe second premise states that it is not the case that Amy must have played tennis. This can be represented as: \u00ac(Amy played tennis).\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is that Jeff did not play basketball. This can be represented as: \u00ac(Jeff played basketball).\n\nTo evaluate the logical validity, we can use a method called Modus Tollens. Modus Tollens is a valid form of argument that states if we have a conditional statement (if A, then B) and the consequent (B) is false, then we can conclude that the antecedent (A) must also be false.\n\nIn this case, the argument follows the form of Modus Tollens. The first premise is a conditional statement, and the second premise states that the consequent is false. Therefore, we can conclude that the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) must also be false.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
