            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. This can be represented as: \nP1: Tom watched football -> Jen watched basketball.\n\nThe second premise states that it is not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. This can be represented as:\nP2: \u00ac(Jen watched basketball).\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is that Tom did not watch football. This can be represented as:\nC: \u00ac(Tom watched football).\n\nTo evaluate the logical validity, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. In this case, we can use a method called Modus Tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (P -> Q) and the consequent (Q) is false, then we can conclude that the antecedent (P) is also false.\n\nApplying Modus Tollens to the premises, we have:\nP1: Tom watched football -> Jen watched basketball.\nP2: \u00ac(Jen watched basketball).\n\nUsing Modus Tollens, we can conclude:\nC: \u00ac(Tom watched football).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
