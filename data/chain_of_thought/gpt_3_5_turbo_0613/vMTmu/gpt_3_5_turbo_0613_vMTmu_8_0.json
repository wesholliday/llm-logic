            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake. This can be represented as: V -> M.\n\nThe second premise states that it is not the case that the mummy must have been awake. This can be represented as: ~M.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is that the vampire was not awake. This can be represented as: ~V.\n\nTo determine if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises, we can use a method called modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (p -> q) and the negation of the consequent (~q), then we can infer the negation of the antecedent (~p).\n\nIn this case, the first premise (V -> M) can be rewritten as ~M -> ~V using the contrapositive. \n\nNow, we have the second premise as ~M and the rewritten first premise as ~M -> ~V. Applying modus tollens, we can infer ~V.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion of the argument follows logically from the premises, making the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
