            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den. This can be represented as: \nP1: Bear in cave \u2192 Wolf in den\n\nThe second premise states that it is not the case that the wolf must have been in the den. This can be represented as the negation of the first premise:\nP2: \u00ac(Bear in cave \u2192 Wolf in den)\n\nThe conclusion is that the bear was not in the cave:\nC: \u00acBear in cave\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we can use a proof by contradiction. We assume that the premises are true and the conclusion is false, and then we show that this leads to a contradiction.\n\nAssume that the bear was in the cave (Bear in cave). From the first premise, this would imply that the wolf must have been in the den (Wolf in den). However, the second premise states that it is not the case that the wolf must have been in the den (\u00ac(Wolf in den)). This leads to a contradiction, as we have both Wolf in den and \u00ac(Wolf in den) being true simultaneously.\n\nSince assuming the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false leads to a contradiction, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
