            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. This can be represented as: \nP1: If A, then B.\n\nThe second premise states that it is not the case that the banana must have been yellow. This can be represented as:\nP2: Not B.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is that the apple was not red. This can be represented as:\nC: Not A.\n\nTo evaluate the logical validity, we can use a method called modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that states if we have a conditional statement (if A, then B) and the consequent (B) is false, then we can conclude that the antecedent (A) is also false.\n\nIn this case, the argument follows the form of modus tollens. If we assume that the premises are true, then the conclusion necessarily follows. If the banana must not have been yellow (P2: Not B), then we can conclude that the apple was not red (C: Not A).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
