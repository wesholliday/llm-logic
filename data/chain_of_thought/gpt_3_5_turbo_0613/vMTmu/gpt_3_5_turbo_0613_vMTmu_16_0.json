            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. This can be represented as: \nIf A (shirt was cotton), then B (pants must have been denim).\n\nThe second premise states that it is not the case that the pants must have been denim. This can be represented as: \nNot B (not the case that pants must have been denim).\n\nThe conclusion is that the shirt was not cotton. This can be represented as: \nNot A (shirt was not cotton).\n\nTo determine if the conclusion follows logically from the premises, we can use a method called modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (if A, then B) and the consequent (B) is false, then we can conclude that the antecedent (A) is also false.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is a conditional statement (if A, then B), and the second premise states that the consequent (B) is false (not B). Therefore, according to modus tollens, we can conclude that the antecedent (A) is false (not A).\n\nBased on this analysis, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
