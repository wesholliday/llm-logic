Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\nPremise 1: If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\nPremise 2: It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race.\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer the following:\n\nIf Chris did not finish the race, then it is not necessarily the case that Alex finished the race. This is because the first premise establishes a conditional relationship between Alex and Chris, stating that if Alex finished, then Chris must have finished. However, it does not state that if Chris did not finish, then Alex did not finish.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Alex did not finish the race based on the given premises. The argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
