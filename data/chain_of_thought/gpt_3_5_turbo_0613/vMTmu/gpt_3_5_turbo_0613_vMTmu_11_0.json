            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry. This can be represented as: \nP1: Cake is chocolate -> Muffins are blueberry\n\nThe second premise states that it is not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry. This can be represented as the negation of the first premise:\nP2: ~(Cake is chocolate -> Muffins are blueberry)\n\nThe conclusion is that the cake was not chocolate. This can be represented as:\nC: Cake is not chocolate\n\nTo determine if the conclusion follows logically from the premises, we can use a method called modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (P -> Q) and the consequent (Q) is false, then we can conclude that the antecedent (P) is also false.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is a conditional statement (P1: Cake is chocolate -> Muffins are blueberry). The second premise is the negation of this conditional statement (P2: ~(Cake is chocolate -> Muffins are blueberry)). Therefore, we can use modus tollens to conclude that the antecedent (Cake is chocolate) is false.\n\nSo, based on the logical structure of the argument and the application of modus tollens, the conclusion that the cake was not chocolate logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
