In other words, there is a possibility that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nIf it is not necessary for Alex to have finished the race, then it is possible that Alex might not have finished the race. This is because if something is not required or obligatory, there is a chance that it did not happen.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical relationship between the two statements, we can infer that \"Alex might not have finished the race\" from \"It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
