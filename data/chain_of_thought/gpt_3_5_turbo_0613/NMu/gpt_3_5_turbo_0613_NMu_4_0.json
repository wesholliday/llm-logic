This statement aligns with the previous statement and does not make any additional claims.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical relationship between the two statements, we can infer \"The alien might not have visited Mars\" from \"It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
