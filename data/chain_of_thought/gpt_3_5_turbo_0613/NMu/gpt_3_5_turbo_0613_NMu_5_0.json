This statement does not provide any information about whether Jeff actually played basketball or not.\n\nOn the other hand, \"Jeff might not have played basketball\" suggests that there is a possibility that Jeff did not play basketball. This statement implies that playing basketball is one of the potential outcomes.\n\nGiven these explanations, we cannot directly infer \"Jeff might not have played basketball\" from \"It's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball.\" The first statement does not provide enough information to determine the possibility of Jeff not playing basketball.\n\nAnswer: No",
