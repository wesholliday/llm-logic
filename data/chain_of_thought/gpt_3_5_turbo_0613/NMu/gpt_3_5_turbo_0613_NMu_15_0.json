This statement does not provide any information about the actual location of the shoes.\n\nOn the other hand, \"The shoes might not be in the closet\" suggests that there is a possibility that the shoes are not in the closet. This statement implies uncertainty about the location of the shoes.\n\nGiven that the first statement only indicates that it is not necessary for the shoes to be in the closet, it does not necessarily imply that the shoes might not be in the closet. It is possible that the shoes are in the closet despite not being required to be there.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The shoes might not be in the closet\" from \"It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
