This means that one of these two options must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the dreb might not be spened. This means that the possibility of the dreb being spened is not certain.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively infer that \"The dreb is vroombed.\" The possibility remains that the dreb could be spened, even though it is not certain.\n\nAnswer: No",
