The statement 'Either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled' tells us that one of two possibilities must be true: either the wug is sproinged or it is garpled.\n\n2. The statement 'The wug might not be garpled' suggests that there is a possibility that the wug is not garpled.\n\n3. Combining these two statements, we can conclude that if the wug is not garpled, then it must be sproinged. This is because the first statement tells us that one of the two possibilities must be true, and the second statement rules out the possibility of the wug being garpled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer 'The wug is sproinged'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
