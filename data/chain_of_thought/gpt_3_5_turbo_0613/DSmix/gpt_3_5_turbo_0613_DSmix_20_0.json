This is because the statement presents a logical disjunction (either/or) where one of the options must be true.\n\nFrom statement 2, we learn that there is a possibility that the fleeg is not surned. However, this statement does not provide any information about whether the fleeg is bluttered or not.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot directly infer that \"The fleeg is bluttered.\" The possibility that the fleeg might not be surned does not provide enough evidence to conclude that it is bluttered.",
