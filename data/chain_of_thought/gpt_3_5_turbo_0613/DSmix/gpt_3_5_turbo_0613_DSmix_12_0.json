It implies that one of these options must be true.\n\n2. \"The smip might not be lupped\": This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the smip is not lupped. It does not provide any information about whether the smip is shripped or not.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot directly infer that \"The smip is shripped.\" The second statement only tells us that the smip might not be lupped, but it does not provide any information about whether it is shripped or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
