This is because the statement presents a logical disjunction (either/or) where one of the options must be true.\n\nFrom statement 2, we are told that the sneg might not be sproted. This means that there is a possibility that the sneg is not sproted.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that if the sneg is not sproted (as stated in statement 2), then it must be crampled (as stated in statement 1). However, we cannot definitively conclude that the sneg is crampled because there is still a possibility that it is sproted.\n\nAnswer: No",
