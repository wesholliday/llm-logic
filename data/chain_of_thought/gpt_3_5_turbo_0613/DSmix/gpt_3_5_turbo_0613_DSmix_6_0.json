This means that one of these two conditions must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the grommet might not be plopped. This means that there is a possibility that the grommet is not plopped.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively infer that \"The grommet is sploffed.\" The possibility remains that the grommet is not plopped, which means it could still be sploffed or not sploffed.\n\nAnswer: No",
