This means that one of these two conditions must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the splat might not be quanked. This means that the possibility of the splat being quanked is not certain.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The splat is morphed.\" It is possible that the splat is morphed, but it could also be quanked. Therefore, we cannot infer that the splat is morphed from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
