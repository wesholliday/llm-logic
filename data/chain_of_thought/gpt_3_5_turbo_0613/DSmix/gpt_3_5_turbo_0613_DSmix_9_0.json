This means that if the twonk is not varnished, it must be plinked.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the twonk might not be plinked. This means that there is a possibility that the twonk is not plinked.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that there is a possibility that the twonk is not plinked and if it is not plinked, it must be varnished. However, we cannot definitively infer that \"The twonk is varnished\" because there is still a possibility that the twonk is not varnished.\n\nAnswer: No",
