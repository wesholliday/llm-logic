This means that one of these two conditions must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that there is a possibility that the clug is not snugged. This means that the condition \"the clug is snugged\" is not necessarily true.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively infer that \"The clug is fleeked.\" The possibility remains that the clug is not snugged, but it does not necessarily mean that it is fleeked. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
