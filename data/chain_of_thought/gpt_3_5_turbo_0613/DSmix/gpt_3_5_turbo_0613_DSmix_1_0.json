This means that at least one of these two conditions must be true.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the flugel might not be zargled. This means that there is a possibility that the flugel is not zargled.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively conclude that the flugel is blimmed based on these statements alone. The possibility remains that the flugel is not blimmed and is instead zargled.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
