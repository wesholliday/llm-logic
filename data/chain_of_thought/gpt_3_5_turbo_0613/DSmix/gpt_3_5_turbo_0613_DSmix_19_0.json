This means that one of these conditions must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the smonk might not be plagged. This means that the possibility of the smonk being plagged is not certain.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively infer that \"The smonk is vreebled.\" The possibility remains that the smonk could be plagged or vreebled.",
