This means that one of these two options must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the whiffle might not be tinked. This means that there is a possibility that the whiffle is not tinked.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively infer that \"The whiffle is shanked.\" The possibility remains that the whiffle is not tinked, which would make the first statement true without the whiffle being shanked.\n\nAnswer: No",
