The first statement tells us something specific about the actions of a \"grazzle\"  in relation to a \"bimboozle quazzle\".  The second statement introduces new terms (\"glorp\", \"zibble\", \"snizzle\") and expands on the actions of the grazzle.\n\nSince the first statement doesn't provide any information about the grazzle's potential actions towards \"glorp\", \"zibble\", or \"snizzle\", we cannot logically infer that the grazzle must perform those actions.  \n\nAnswer: no \n",
