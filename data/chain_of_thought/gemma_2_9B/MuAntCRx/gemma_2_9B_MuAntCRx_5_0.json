This implies a necessary condition: if something is plonk, it must also be shimble for.\n\nThe conclusion states \"The plonk must zibber for and be shimble for\". This introduces a new condition: zibber for.\n\nThe premise doesn't provide any information about whether plonk must also zibber for.  Therefore, we cannot infer that plonk must both zibber for and be shimble for from the given premise.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
