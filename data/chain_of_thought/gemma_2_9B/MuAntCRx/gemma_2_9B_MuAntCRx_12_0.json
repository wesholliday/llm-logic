This means that \"fizzle blimple\" is a necessary condition for something to be a \"frozz\".  The new statement says \"The frozz must be flump frazzle and be fizzle blimple\". This means that \"flump frazzle\" and \"fizzle blimple\" are both necessary conditions for something to be a \"frozz\".  \n\nSince \"fizzle blimple\" is already a necessary condition, the new statement is stronger than the original statement.  Therefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
