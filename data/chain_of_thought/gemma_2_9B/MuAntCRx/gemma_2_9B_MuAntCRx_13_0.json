The first statement, \"The crunk must quazzle quorple,\" tells us that the action of \"quazzling quorple\" is a necessary condition for something to be considered \"crunk.\"  \n\nThe second statement, \"The crunk must quork gribble and quazzle quorple,\" introduces a new action, \"quorking gribble.\"  \n\nSince the first statement doesn't mention anything about \"quorking gribble,\" we can't infer that it's a necessary condition for being \"crunk.\"\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
