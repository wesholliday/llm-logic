The first statement, \"The wibble must wibble fribble zizz,\" tells us something about the necessary occurrence of certain actions or states involving \"wibble,\" \"fribble,\" and \"zizz.\"  \n\nThe second statement, \"The wibble must blimp zibble plimp and wibble fribble zizz,\" introduces new elements: \"blimp,\" \"zibble,\" and \"plimp.\"  \n\nSince the first statement doesn't mention anything about \"blimp,\" \"zibble,\" or \"plimp,\" we cannot logically infer that they must also occur.  \n\nAnswer: no \n",
