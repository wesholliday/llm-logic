It doesn't, however, say anything about other entities or actions.  \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the quazzle must be frazzle by flibbit and be flibbit by zizz. The original statement is very specific and doesn't provide any basis for making broader assumptions about other actions or actors.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
