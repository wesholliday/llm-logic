The first statement tells us something specific about the quazzle: it *must* gribble crunk.  The second statement adds more information, saying the quazzle must also quork blurble in addition to gribbling crunk.  \n\nSince the first statement doesn't say anything about the quazzle quorking blurble, we can't logically infer that it must do both.  \n\nAnswer: no \n",
