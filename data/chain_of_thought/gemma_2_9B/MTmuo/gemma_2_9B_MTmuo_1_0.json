It says that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue also attended.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can conclude that Mary wasn't at the wedding.  \n\nWe can't directly conclude that. Here's why:\n\n* Statement 1 only tells us Sue *might not* have been there. It doesn't say anything about Mary.\n* Statement 2 only tells us what would happen *if* Mary was there. It doesn't say anything about whether or not she actually was.\n\nWe need more information to determine Mary's attendance.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
