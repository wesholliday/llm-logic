It doesn't give us any information about Ben.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\" This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if Ben's action (eating pasta) is true, then a consequence follows (Kate eating salad).\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that Ben did *not* eat pasta.  \n\nNotice that the first statement doesn't rule out the possibility of Ben eating pasta.  The second statement only tells us what happens *if* Ben eats pasta, it doesn't say anything about whether or not he actually did.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
