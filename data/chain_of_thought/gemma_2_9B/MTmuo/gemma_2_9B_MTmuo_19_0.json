            "content": "\n\nExplanation: \nLet's break down the statements:\n\n* **Statement 1:** \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball\"  This means Jen might have watched basketball, but we can't definitively say she did.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement. It says that if Tom's action (watching football) is true, then a consequence follows (Jen watching basketball).\n\nNow, to determine if we can infer that Tom did not watch football, we need to consider the relationship between these statements.  The first statement doesn't directly tell us anything about Tom's actions. The second statement sets up a scenario where Jen watches basketball *only if* Tom watches football.\n\nSince we don't know for sure if Jen watched basketball, we can't definitively say that Tom didn't watch football.  It's possible that Tom watched football and Jen watched basketball, or that neither of them watched football.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
