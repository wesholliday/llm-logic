It doesn't say the wolf definitely wasn't in the den, just that it wasn't a certainty.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\" This is a conditional statement. It says that if the bear is in the cave, then we can be certain the wolf is in the den.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Can we infer 'The bear was not in the cave'?\"\n\nTo answer this, we need to see if the given statements logically lead to the conclusion.  We can use a technique called \"proof by contradiction\".\n\n1. **Assume the opposite:** Let's assume the bear *was* in the cave.\n\n2. **Check for conflict:** If the bear was in the cave, according to statement 2, the wolf *must* have been in the den.\n\n3. **Contradiction:** But statement 1 says the wolf *doesn't have to* be in the den. This creates a contradiction!\n\nSince our assumption leads to a contradiction, it must be false. Therefore, the bear could not have been in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
