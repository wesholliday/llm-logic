It tells us that if Alex finished, then Chris definitely finished too.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can conclude that Alex did *not* finish the race.  \n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n* **Possibility 1: Alex finished the race.**  If this is true, then according to Statement 2, Chris must have finished too. This contradicts Statement 1, which says it's possible Chris didn't finish. So, Possibility 1 cannot be true.\n\n* **Possibility 2: Alex did not finish the race.** This possibility doesn't contradict either statement.\n\nSince Possibility 1 is ruled out, the only remaining possibility is that Alex did not finish the race.\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
