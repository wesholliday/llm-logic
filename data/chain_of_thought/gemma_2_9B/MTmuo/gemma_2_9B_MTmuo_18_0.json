            "content": "\n\nHere's how to break down the logic:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** It's not the case that the truck must have been metal. This means the truck could have been made of other materials.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. This establishes a conditional relationship: the state of the doll (plastic) directly influences the state of the truck (metal).\n\n3. **Conclusion:** We want to know if we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n*  Premise 1 doesn't directly tell us anything about the doll's material.\n*  Premise 2 sets up a scenario where *if* the doll is plastic, *then* the truck is metal.  It doesn't say anything about what happens if the doll isn't plastic.\n\n*  To reach the conclusion that the doll was not plastic, we'd need more information.  For example, if we knew the truck was made of wood, we could then use Premise 2 to infer the doll wasn't plastic.\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
