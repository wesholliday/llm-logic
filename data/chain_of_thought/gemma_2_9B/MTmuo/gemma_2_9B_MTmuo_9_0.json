It says that if Lisa's action (buying the red shirt) happens, then a specific consequence follows (Mark buying the blue shirt).\n\nNow, we want to know if we can conclude that Lisa didn't buy the red shirt.  \n\nNotice that the statements don't directly say anything about Lisa buying or not buying the red shirt. Statement 2 only tells us what would happen *if* she did buy it.  \n\nTo reach the conclusion that Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, we'd need more information or a stronger link between the statements. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
