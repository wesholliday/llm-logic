It says that if the griffin is in the forest, then we can definitely say the unicorn is also in the forest.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Can we infer 'The griffin was not in the forest'?\"\n\nWe can't directly infer that the griffin was not in the forest. Here's why:\n\n* Statement 1 doesn't tell us anything about the griffin's presence. It only focuses on the unicorn.\n* Statement 2 only tells us what would happen *if* the griffin was in the forest. It doesn't say anything about whether or not the griffin actually is in the forest.\n\nWe need more information to determine the griffin's location.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
