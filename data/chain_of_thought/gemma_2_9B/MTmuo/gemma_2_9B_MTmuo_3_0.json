It tells us that if James wrote the book, then it has to be a mystery.\n\nNow, we want to see if we can conclude that \"The book was not written by James.\"  \n\nWe can use a technique called \"modus tollens\" to help us. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states:\n\n* If P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\nLet's apply this to our statements:\n\n* P: The book was written by James.\n* Q: The book must be a mystery novel.\n\nWe know from Statement 1 that Q (the book must be a mystery novel) is not necessarily true.  \n\nTherefore, using modus tollens, we can conclude that P (the book was written by James) must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
