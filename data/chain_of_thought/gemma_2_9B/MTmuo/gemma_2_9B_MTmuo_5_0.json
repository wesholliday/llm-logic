It says that if Jeff's action (playing basketball) happened, then a consequence would follow (Amy playing tennis).\n\nNow, we want to know if we can conclude that Jeff did *not* play basketball.  \n\nLet's think about the logic:\n\n*  The first statement doesn't tell us anything about Jeff's actions.\n*  The second statement only tells us what *would* happen if Jeff played basketball. It doesn't say anything about whether he actually did play basketball.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Jeff did not play basketball based on the given statements. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
