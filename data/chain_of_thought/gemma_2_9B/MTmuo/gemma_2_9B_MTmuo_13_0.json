It says that if the car is red, then we can definitely conclude the truck is blue.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Relationship:**\n\n   * Notice that Premise 2 introduces a dependence: the color of the truck is tied to the color of the car *only if* the car is red.\n\n3. **Considering the Negation:**\n\n   * We want to know if we can infer \"The car was not red.\"  This is the negation of \"The car was red.\"\n\n4. **Applying Logic:**\n\n   *  Since Premise 1 doesn't tell us anything about the color of the car, we can't directly conclude that the car was not red. \n   *  Premise 2 only tells us what happens *if* the car is red. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the car is not red.\n\n   *  Therefore, we cannot definitively say that the car was not red based on the given information.\n\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
