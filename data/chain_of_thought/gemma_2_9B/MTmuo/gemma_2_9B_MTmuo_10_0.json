It doesn't give us a definitive answer about the cat's location.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\" This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the dog is inside, then we can be certain the cat was outside.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n* If we assume the dog *was* inside, then according to statement 2, the cat *must* have been outside.  \n* However, statement 1 tells us the cat *didn't have to* be outside.\n\nThis creates a contradiction.  Therefore, our initial assumption that the dog was inside must be false.\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
