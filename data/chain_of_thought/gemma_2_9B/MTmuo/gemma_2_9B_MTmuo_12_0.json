It says that if Joe's action (going to the park) is true, then a consequence follows (Lucy going to the zoo).\n\nNow, to determine if we can infer that Joe did not go to the park, we need to consider the relationship between these statements.  \n\nThe first statement doesn't directly tell us anything about Joe's actions. The second statement sets up a possibility: if Joe went to the park, Lucy went to the zoo. However, it doesn't say anything about whether Joe actually went to the park.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Joe did not go to the park based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
