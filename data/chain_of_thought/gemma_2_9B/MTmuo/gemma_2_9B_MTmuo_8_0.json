It's possible the mummy was asleep or in some other state.\n   * Statement 2 introduces a conditional relationship: if the vampire was awake, then the mummy *must* have been awake. This doesn't say anything about whether the vampire *was* awake or not, just that if it was, the mummy would have been awake too.\n\n3. **Consider the inference:**\n\n   We want to know if we can conclude that the vampire was not awake.  Let's think about the possibilities:\n\n   * **If the vampire was awake:**  Statement 2 tells us the mummy must have been awake. This contradicts Statement 1, which says we can't be sure the mummy was awake. So, if the vampire was awake, the statements together create a contradiction.\n\n   * **If the vampire was not awake:**  Statement 2 doesn't say anything about what happens if the vampire is not awake. The mummy could be awake or asleep in this case.\n\n4. **Draw the conclusion:**\n\n   Since the only scenario that creates a contradiction is if the vampire was awake, the only logical conclusion is that the vampire must not have been awake.\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes",
