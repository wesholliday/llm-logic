It says that if a certain event (the alien visiting Mars) happens, then another event (the robot visiting Jupiter) *must* also happen.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer:\n\n* We know the robot *might* have visited Jupiter, but we don't know for sure.\n* We also know that if the alien visited Mars, the robot *must* have visited Jupiter.\n\n* **The key here is that we're trying to figure out if the alien *did not* visit Mars.**\n\nCan we definitively say that the alien didn't visit Mars based on the information given?  No, we can't.  \n\nHere's why:\n\n*  Maybe the alien didn't visit Mars, and therefore the robot didn't *have* to visit Jupiter.\n*  Or, maybe the alien *did* visit Mars, and the robot *did* visit Jupiter (we just don't know for sure if the robot did).\n\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
