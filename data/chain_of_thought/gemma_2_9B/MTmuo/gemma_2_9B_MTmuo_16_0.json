(Symbolically: \u00acP)\n   * Statement 2: If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. (Symbolically: C \u2192 P)\n\n2. **Analyze the statements:**\n\n   * Statement 1 tells us that the pants were *not necessarily* denim. It leaves open the possibility that they could have been made of a different material.\n   * Statement 2 introduces a conditional relationship: if the shirt was cotton (C), then the pants had to be denim (P).\n\n3. **Consider the question:**\n\n   * The question asks if we can infer that the shirt was *not* cotton (\u00acC).\n\n4. **Apply logic:**\n\n   * We can't directly infer \u00acC from the given statements. Here's why:\n\n     * Statement 1 doesn't say anything about the shirt's material.\n     * Statement 2 only tells us what happens *if* the shirt is cotton. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the shirt is *not* cotton.\n\n   *  We need more information to determine the shirt's material.\n\n\n\nAnswer: no",
