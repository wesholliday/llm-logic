(This is a conditional statement, meaning it sets up a cause-and-effect relationship)\n    * **Premise 2:** The book is a mystery novel. (This is a factual statement)\n    * **Conclusion:** The book was written by James. (This is what we're trying to determine)\n\n* **The Flaw:**\n\n    While Premise 1 tells us that writing by James *causes* the book to be a mystery novel, it doesn't say that *only* James can write mystery novels.  There could be other authors who also write mystery novels.\n\n* **Analogy:**\n\n    Think of it like this: \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\"  We know the ground is wet (Premise 2).  Does that *necessarily* mean it's raining (Conclusion)?  No, it could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, a burst pipe, etc.).\n\n**Answer:** no \n",
