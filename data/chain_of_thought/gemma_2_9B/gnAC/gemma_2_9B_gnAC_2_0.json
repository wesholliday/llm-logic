P\n\nThen we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The griffin was in the forest.\n* Q: The unicorn was in the forest.\n\nWe are given:\n\n* Premise 1: If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest (If P, then Q).\n* Premise 2: The unicorn was in the forest (P is true).\n\nTherefore, according to Modus Ponens, we can conclude that the griffin was in the forest (Q is true).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
