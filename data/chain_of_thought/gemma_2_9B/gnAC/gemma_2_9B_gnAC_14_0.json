P\n\nThen we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The bear was in the cave\n* Q: The wolf was in the den\n\nWe are given:\n\n* If P, then Q (If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den)\n* P is true (The wolf was in the den)\n\nTherefore, we can apply Modus Ponens and conclude that Q is true.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
