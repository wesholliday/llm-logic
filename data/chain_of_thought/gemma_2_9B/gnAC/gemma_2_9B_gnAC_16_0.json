It means that if the shirt *is* cotton, then we can *conclude* that the pants *must be* denim.\n\n* **The Flaw:**  Just because the pants *are* denim doesn't automatically mean the shirt *was* cotton. There could be other reasons why the pants are denim.  \n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine this: The pants were denim because they were bought as a matching set with a polyester shirt.  \n\n**Answer:** \nno \n",
