P\n\nThen we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The alien visited Mars\n* Q: The robot visited Jupiter\n\nWe are given:\n\n1. If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter (If P, then Q)\n2. The robot visited Jupiter (P)\n\nTherefore, according to Modus Ponens, we can conclude that the alien visited Mars (Q).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
