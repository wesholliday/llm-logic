There could be other reasons why Amy played tennis.\n\n**Think of it this way:**\n\nIf it's raining, then the ground is wet.  The ground is wet. Does it *necessarily* follow that it's raining? No, there could be other reasons for the ground to be wet (like someone watering their lawn).\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
