It means that if the doll *is* plastic, then we can *conclude* that the truck *must be* metal.\n\n* **The Flaw:**  Just because the truck *is* metal doesn't automatically mean the doll *was* plastic.  There could be other reasons why the truck is metal.  \n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine this: The truck is metal because it's a toy truck, but the doll is made of wood. This scenario satisfies the original statement (if the doll was plastic, the truck would be metal), but the doll isn't plastic.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
