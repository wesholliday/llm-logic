It means that if the apple *were* red, we could *conclude* that the banana *would be* yellow.  It doesn't say anything about what happens if the banana *is* yellow.\n\n* **Affirming the Consequent:**  The problem arises when we take the truth of the consequent (the banana being yellow) and assume it *must* mean the antecedent (the apple being red) is also true.  \n\n* **Counterexamples:**  There could be many other reasons why the banana might be yellow, even if the apple wasn't red.  \n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
