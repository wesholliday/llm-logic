However, there could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo.  Maybe she went with someone else, or maybe she went for a different reason entirely.\n\n**The original statement doesn't guarantee that Joe went to the park; it only states that *if* he did, then Lucy would have gone to the zoo.**\n\nAnswer: no \n",
