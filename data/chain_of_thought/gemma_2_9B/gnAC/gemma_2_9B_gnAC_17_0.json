However, this isn't necessarily true. There could be other reasons why Kate ate salad, even if Ben didn't eat pasta.\n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine a scenario where Kate always eats salad after school, regardless of what Ben eats.  In this case, the original statement is true (if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad), but it doesn't mean Ben actually ate pasta.\n\n\nAnswer: \nno",
