The project was completed by Friday.\n2. The project was extended.\n\nSince the statement uses \"or,\" it means that at least one of these possibilities must be true.  It doesn't say *which* one is true, only that one of them is.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the project was extended. It's possible it was completed by Friday.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
