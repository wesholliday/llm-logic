The restaurant was closed on Monday.\n2. The restaurant was open for limited hours on Monday.\n\nThe second statement only focuses on the possibility of limited hours.  It doesn't rule out the possibility of the restaurant being closed.  \n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively say that the restaurant *must* have been open for limited hours. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
