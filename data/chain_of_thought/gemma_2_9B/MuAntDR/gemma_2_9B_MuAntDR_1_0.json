Here's why:\n\n* **The original statement presents two possibilities:**  It suggests the envelope could be in either location.\n* **No information excludes the possibility of it being under the bed:** The statement doesn't say anything about the envelope *not* being under the bed.\n\nTherefore, while \"upstairs\" is a possible location, we can't conclude with certainty that it's the only possibility.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
