This means there are two possibilities:\n\n* **Possibility 1:** The book was on the shelf.\n* **Possibility 2:** The library was in the library.\n\nThe second statement claims the book *must* have been in the library. This is too strong.  \n\nSince the first statement allows for the possibility that the book was on the shelf, we cannot definitively say it *must* have been in the library. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
