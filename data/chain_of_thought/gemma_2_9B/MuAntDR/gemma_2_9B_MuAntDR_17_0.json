The report was accurate.\n2. The report was revised.\n\nThe second statement, \"The report must have been revised,\"  is only one of these possibilities.  \n\nSince the first statement allows for the possibility that the report was accurate, we cannot definitively conclude that it *must* have been revised.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
