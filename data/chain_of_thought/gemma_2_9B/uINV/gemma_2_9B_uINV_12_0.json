This can be represented as P -> Q (where P = Joe went to the park, Q = Lucy went to the zoo).\n\n* **Inverse Statement:** If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo. This is represented as ~P -> ~Q (where ~ means \"not\").\n\nThe original statement does *not* guarantee that the inverse is also true.  \n\n**Counterexample:**\n\nImagine a scenario where Joe decides to stay home, but Lucy still goes to the zoo for a separate reason. This would make the inverse statement false.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
