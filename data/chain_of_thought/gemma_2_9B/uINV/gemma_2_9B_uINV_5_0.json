It states that if one event (Jeff playing basketball) happens, then another event (Amy playing tennis) must also happen.  \n\nTo determine if the converse is true, we need to consider the structure of the original statement. The original statement is in the form \"If P, then Q\". The converse would be \"If not P, then not Q\".\n\nIn logic, the converse of a conditional statement is not always true.  Just because Jeff playing basketball leads to Amy playing tennis, doesn't necessarily mean that if Jeff *didn't* play basketball, Amy *couldn't* play tennis.  \n\nAmy might play tennis for other reasons, or she might not play at all.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
