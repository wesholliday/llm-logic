It doesn't say anything about what happens if the car isn't red.\n\n* **Denying the antecedent:**  The question asks us to assume the car was *not* red and then conclude the truck was *not* blue. This is a fallacy because the original statement doesn't provide information about the truck's color when the car is not red.\n\n* **Counterexample:**  Imagine a scenario where the car is green, but the truck is still blue. This scenario satisfies the original statement (the car wasn't red, but we don't know anything about the truck's color in this case).\n\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
