            "content": "\n\nExplanation: \nThis is a logic problem that deals with conditional statements. \n\n* **Original Statement:** If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This can be represented as \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n* **Question:**  We want to know if the opposite of the original statement is also true. The opposite of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not P, then not Q\".\n\n* **Analyzing the Opposite:**  The opposite statement says that if Mary was *not* at the wedding, then Sue was *not* at the wedding.  \n\n* **Logical Connection:**  The original statement doesn't guarantee this.  It only tells us that if Mary *was* there, Sue *was* there. It doesn't say anything about what happens if Mary *isn't* there.\n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine a scenario where Mary wasn't invited to the wedding, but Sue was invited and attended. This would violate the opposite statement.\n\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
