This can be represented as \"P -> Q\" where P is \"the apple is red\" and Q is \"the banana is yellow\".\n\n* **Inverse Statement:** If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow. This can be represented as \"\u00acP -> \u00acQ\" where \u00acP means \"the apple is not red\" and \u00acQ means \"the banana is not yellow\".\n\n* **Key Point:** The original statement does not guarantee that if the apple is not red, the banana is also not yellow.  The original statement only tells us what happens when the apple *is* red. It doesn't say anything about what happens when the apple is not red.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
