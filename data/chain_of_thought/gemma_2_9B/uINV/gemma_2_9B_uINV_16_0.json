The original statement presents a conditional relationship:\n\n* **If** the shirt was cotton **then** the pants were denim.\n\nThis means that if the shirt *is* cotton, we can be certain the pants are denim.  However, it doesn't tell us anything about what happens when the shirt is *not* cotton.\n\nThe statement doesn't say anything about what happens to the pants if the shirt isn't cotton. They could still be denim, or they could be something else entirely.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
