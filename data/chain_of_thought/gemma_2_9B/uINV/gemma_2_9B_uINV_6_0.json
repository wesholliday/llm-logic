The original statement sets up a conditional relationship:\n\n* **If** Sue chose pizza, **then** Bob chose pasta.  \n\nThis doesn't necessarily mean the opposite is also true.  \n\nConsider this:\n\n* **Scenario 1:** Sue chose pizza, and Bob chose pasta (This fits the original statement).\n* **Scenario 2:** Sue chose something else, and Bob chose pasta (This doesn't violate the original statement).\n\nThe original statement only tells us what happens *when* Sue chooses pizza. It doesn't say anything about what happens when Sue *doesn't* choose pizza.\n\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
