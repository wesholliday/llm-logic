            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nLet's break down the logic here. We're dealing with a conditional statement:\n\n* **Premise:** If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.  This can be represented symbolically as:  V \u2192 M (where V = vampire awake, M = mummy awake)\n\n* **Question:** Can we infer that the opposite is also true?  That is, if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake? This would be represented as: \u00acV \u2192 \u00acM\n\nThe original statement doesn't give us enough information to definitively say that the opposite is true.  Here's why:\n\n* **Counterexamples:**  Imagine a scenario where the vampire is asleep, but the mummy is magically awake for some other reason. This would violate the proposed opposite statement (\u00acV \u2192 \u00acM).\n\n* **Conditional Logic:**  Conditional statements only guarantee the truth of the consequent (the \"then\" part) *if* the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is true. They don't necessarily tell us anything about what happens when the antecedent is false.\n\n\nAnswer: \nno",
