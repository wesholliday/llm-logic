It tells us that there's a relationship where one event (dog being inside) leads to another event (cat being outside).\n\nNow, we want to know if the opposite is also true: \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside.\"  This is the converse of the original statement.\n\nThe converse of a conditional statement is not always true.  \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Example:**  \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\" This is true. But the converse, \"If the ground is wet, then it's raining,\" is not always true. The ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled water).\n\nIn our case, there could be other reasons why the cat might be outside even if the dog is not inside.  Maybe the cat has a cat flap, or maybe someone let it out.\n\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
