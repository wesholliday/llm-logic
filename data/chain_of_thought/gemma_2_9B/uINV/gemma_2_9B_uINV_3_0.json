            "content": "\n\nExplanation: \nLet's break down the given statement and analyze its logical structure.\n\nThe statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" can be represented symbolically as:\n\n* P -> Q\n\nWhere:\n\n* P: The book was written by James.\n* Q: The book is a mystery novel.\n\nThis statement asserts a conditional relationship: if P is true, then Q must also be true.\n\nNow, we want to determine if the opposite of this statement is also true. The opposite of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not P, then not Q\".  Symbolically:\n\n* ~P -> ~Q\n\nWhere:\n\n* ~P: The book was not written by James.\n* ~Q: The book is not a mystery novel.\n\nThe original statement doesn't provide enough information to conclude whether the opposite statement is true.  \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Counterexample:**  Imagine a scenario where the book was written by someone else (not James), but it's still a mystery novel. This would violate the proposed opposite statement.\n\n* **Missing Information:**  We don't know if there are other authors who write mystery novels besides James.  \n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that if the book was not written by James, then it is not a mystery novel.\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
