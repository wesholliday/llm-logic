The original statement presents a conditional relationship:\n\n* **If** the doll was plastic **then** the truck was metal.\n\nThis means that if the doll *is* plastic, we can be certain the truck *is* metal.  However, it doesn't tell us anything about what happens if the doll is *not* plastic.\n\nThe statement doesn't say anything about the truck's material if the doll isn't plastic. It's possible the truck could be metal, or it could be made of something else entirely.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
