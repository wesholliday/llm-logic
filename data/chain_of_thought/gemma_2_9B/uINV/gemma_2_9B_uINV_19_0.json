            "content": "\n\nExplanation: \nThis is a logic problem that deals with conditional statements. \n\n* **Original Statement:** If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This can be represented as \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\n* **Question:**  We want to know if the opposite of the original statement is also true.  The opposite of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not P, then not Q\".\n\n* **Analyzing the Opposite:**  The opposite statement says that if Tom *did not* watch football (not P), then Jen *did not* watch basketball (not Q).\n\n* **Logical Relationship:**  The original statement does *not* guarantee that the opposite is also true.  There could be other reasons why Jen might watch basketball even if Tom didn't watch football.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
