It doesn't say anything about what happens if the cake *isn't* chocolate.\n\n* **Denying the antecedent:**  The question asks us to assume the cake *wasn't* chocolate and then conclude the muffins *weren't* blueberry. This is a fallacy because the original statement doesn't provide any information to support that conclusion.\n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine a scenario where the cake is vanilla, but the muffins are still blueberry. This scenario satisfies the original statement (the cake wasn't chocolate, but it doesn't say anything about the muffins).\n\n\nAnswer: \nno",
