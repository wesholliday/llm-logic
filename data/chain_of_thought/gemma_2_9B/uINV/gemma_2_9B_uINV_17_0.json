This doesn't mean Kate *only* eats salad when Ben eats pasta, just that if Ben eats pasta, salad is a guaranteed consequence.\n\n* **Denying the antecedent means flipping the first part of the conditional:**  We're saying \"What if Ben *didn't* eat pasta?\"\n\n* **The problem is that the original statement doesn't tell us anything about what happens when Ben *doesn't* eat pasta.**  Kate could still eat salad for other reasons, or she might not.\n\n**Therefore, we cannot infer that if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad.**\n\nAnswer: no \n",
