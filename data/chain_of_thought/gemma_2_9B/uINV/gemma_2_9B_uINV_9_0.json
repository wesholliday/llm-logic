This doesn't mean that Mark *only* buys the blue shirt if Lisa buys the red shirt. There could be other reasons why Mark might buy the blue shirt.\n\n* **Denying the antecedent:**  The question asks us to assume Lisa *didn't* buy the red shirt.  The fallacy lies in assuming that this automatically means Mark *didn't* buy the blue shirt.  \n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine Lisa decides not to buy the red shirt, but Mark still buys the blue shirt because he saw it on sale. The original statement doesn't rule out this possibility.\n\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
