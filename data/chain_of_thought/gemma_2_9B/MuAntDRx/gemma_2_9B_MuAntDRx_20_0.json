The quorple is quorple.\n\nThe statement doesn't say *either* of these possibilities *must* be true, just that *one* of them *must* be true.  \n\nTherefore, we can't definitively say that \"The quorple must be quorple\".  It's possible, but the statement doesn't rule out the possibility that the quorple is quazzle.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
