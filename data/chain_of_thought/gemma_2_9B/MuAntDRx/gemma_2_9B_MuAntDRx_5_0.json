The wibble is blimple.\n\nSince it's an \"or\" statement, it means at least one of these possibilities must be true.  It doesn't say *only* one is true, so it's possible for both to be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the wibble must be blimple, because it's one of the two possibilities presented.\n\nAnswer: yes \n\n\n",
