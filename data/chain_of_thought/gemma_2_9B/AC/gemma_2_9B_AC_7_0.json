If P, then Q (conditional statement)\n2. P (affirmation of the antecedent)\n\nThen we can conclude:\n\nQ (affirmation of the consequent)\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: Alex finished the race\n* Q: Chris finished the race\n\nWe are given:\n\n1. If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race (If P, then Q)\n2. Chris finished the race (P)\n\nTherefore, we can apply Modus Ponens and conclude that Alex finished the race (Q).\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
