If P, then Q (Conditional statement)\n2. P (Affirmation of the antecedent)\n\nThen we can conclude:\n\nQ (Affirmation of the consequent)\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The vampire was awake\n* Q: The mummy was awake\n\nLet's break down the premises:\n\n* \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is our conditional statement (If P, then Q).\n* \"The mummy was awake\" is the affirmation of the consequent (Q).\n\nSince we have both the conditional statement and the affirmation of the consequent, Modus Ponens allows us to conclude that the antecedent (P) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n\n\n",
