It sets up a cause-and-effect relationship: if the first part (the alien visiting Mars) is true, then the second part (the robot visiting Jupiter) must also be true.\n    * \"The robot visited Jupiter\" tells us that the second part of the conditional statement is true.\n\n* **The Flaw:**\n    *  Affirming the consequent means assuming that because the consequent (the robot visiting Jupiter) is true, the antecedent (the alien visiting Mars) must also be true. This is not necessarily the case.\n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine a scenario where the alien never visited Mars, but there's another reason why the robot visited Jupiter (perhaps it was sent there on a mission).  \n\n**Answer:** no \n\n\n",
