It sets up a cause-and-effect relationship: if the first part (Ben eating pasta) is true, then the second part (Kate eating the salad) must also be true.\n    * \"Kate ate the salad\" tells us the second part of the conditional statement is true.\n\n* **The Flaw:**\n    *  Affirming the consequent means assuming that because the consequent (Kate eating the salad) is true, the antecedent (Ben eating pasta) must also be true.  This is not necessarily the case.\n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine a scenario where Ben didn't eat pasta, but Kate ate the salad for some other reason.  This would satisfy the second statement but not the first.\n\n**Answer:** no \n",
