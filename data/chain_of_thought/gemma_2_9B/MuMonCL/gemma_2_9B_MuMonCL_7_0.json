The word \"and\" indicates that both clauses are necessary for the original statement to be true.  \n\nIf we isolate the first clause, \"The exam must have been difficult\", we are left with a statement that is potentially true even if the second clause is false. For example, an exam could be difficult without covering all chapters.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The exam must have been difficult\" from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
