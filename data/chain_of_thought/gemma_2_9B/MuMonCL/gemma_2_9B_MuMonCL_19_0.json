This means that both conditions, completing the application online and including references, were necessary.  \n\nTo infer \"The application must have been completed online\", we need to see if the first condition is sufficient to guarantee the truth of the inferred statement.  \n\nSince the original statement doesn't say anything about the application *not* being completed online, we can infer that it *must* have been completed online.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
