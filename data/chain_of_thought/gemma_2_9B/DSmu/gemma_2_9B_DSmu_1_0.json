It means one of two things must be true: Fido is inside, or Fido must be in the garden.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" This is the negation of the second part of the first statement.\n\nSince the second statement is true, we know that Fido does *not* have to be in the garden.  This leaves us with only one option from the first statement: Fido must be inside. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
