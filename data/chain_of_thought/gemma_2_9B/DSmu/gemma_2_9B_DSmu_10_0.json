There's no other option considered.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\" This means we can't definitively say the sock is under the bed. It could be there, but it's not the only possibility.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship between the statements:\n\nIf we combine the information, we see that the sock can't be under the bed (from statement 2), and it has to be *somewhere* (from statement 1).  The only remaining option is the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
