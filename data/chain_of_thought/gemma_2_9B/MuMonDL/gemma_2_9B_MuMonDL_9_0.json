The phrase \"must have been delayed\" suggests a certainty that a delay occurred. \n\nThe statement \"The flight must have been delayed or rescheduled\" introduces an additional possibility: that the flight was rescheduled instead of, or in addition to, being delayed.  \n\nSince the original statement doesn't rule out the possibility of rescheduling, we can't definitively say that the flight *must* have been rescheduled. It's possible the flight was delayed, and there's no information to confirm rescheduling.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
