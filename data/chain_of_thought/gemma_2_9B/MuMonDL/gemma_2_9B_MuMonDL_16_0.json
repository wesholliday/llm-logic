The phrase \"or as requested\" introduces an additional possibility, suggesting that cleaning could occur more frequently than daily if requested.  \n\nSince the original statement doesn't exclude the possibility of additional cleaning requests, we can infer that \"The room must have been cleaned daily or as requested\". \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
