It implies that the project *had* to be finished by the end of Friday.  \n\nAdding \"or next week\" weakens the original statement.  It introduces a possibility that the project could have been completed later, which contradicts the original \"must\" requirement. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the project must have been completed by Friday or next week from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
