It asserts that the restaurant was closed on Mondays without any qualification.  \n\nThe proposed inference \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays or had limited hours\" introduces an alternative possibility.  \n\nSince the original statement doesn't provide any information about the restaurant's hours on other days, we cannot logically infer that it had limited hours. The original statement only tells us about its closure on Mondays.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
