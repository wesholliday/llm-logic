It means one of two things must be true: the whiffle is shanked, or the whiffle is tinked.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked.\" This statement is saying that it's possible for the whiffle *not* to be tinked.\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications:\n\n* If the whiffle is *not* shanked, then according to Statement 1, it *must* be tinked.\n* But Statement 2 tells us it's *not* the case that the whiffle *must* be tinked.\n\nThis means the only remaining possibility is that the whiffle *is* shanked.\n\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
