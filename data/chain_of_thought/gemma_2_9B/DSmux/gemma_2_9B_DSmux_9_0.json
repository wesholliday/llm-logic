It means one of two things must be true: the twonk is varnished, or the twonk must be plinked.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the twonk must be plinked.\" This statement negates the second part of the disjunction in Statement 1.  \n\nSince we know the second part of the disjunction (the twonk must be plinked) is false, the only remaining option that satisfies the original disjunction is the first part: the twonk must be varnished.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
