It means one of two things must be true: the glip is slogged, or the glip must be tragged.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the glip must be tragged.\" This statement negates the second part of the disjunction in Statement 1.\n\nSince the second part of the original disjunction is ruled out, the only remaining possibility is the first part.\n\nAnswer: yes \n\n\n",
