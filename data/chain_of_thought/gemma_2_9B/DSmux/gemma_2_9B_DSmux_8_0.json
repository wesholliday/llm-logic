We can represent this as: NOT D.\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications:\n\n* If the sprocket is daggled (D), then Statement 2 is false.\n* Since Statement 2 is true, the sprocket cannot be daggled (D).\n\nTherefore, the only remaining option from Statement 1 is that the sprocket must be cranked (S).\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
