It means one of two things must be true: the grommet is sploffed, or the grommet must be plopped.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped.\" This statement negates the second part of the disjunction in Statement 1.\n\nSince we know the second part of the disjunction (the grommet must be plopped) is false, the only remaining option from Statement 1 must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
