It means one of two things must be true: the splat is morphed, or the splat must be quanked.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked.\" This is a negation of the second part of the disjunction in Statement 1.\n\nSince Statement 2 tells us the second part of the disjunction is false (the splat doesn't *must* be quanked), the only remaining option from Statement 1 must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
