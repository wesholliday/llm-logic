It means one of two things must be true: the dreb is vroombed, or the dreb must be spened.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the dreb must be spened.\" This statement negates the second part of the disjunction in Statement 1.\n\nSince we know the second part of the disjunction (the dreb must be spened) is false, the only remaining option is the first part: the dreb must be vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes \n\n\n",
