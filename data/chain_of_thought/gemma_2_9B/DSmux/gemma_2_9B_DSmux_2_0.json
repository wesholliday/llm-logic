It means one of two things must be true: the wug is flooped, or the wug must be bimmed.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the wug must be bimmed.\" This statement negates the second part of the disjunction in Statement 1.  \n\nSince we know the wug can't be bimmed (Statement 2), the only remaining option from Statement 1 is that the wug must be flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
