It means one of two things must be true: the shank is plooked, or the shank must be nugged.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the shank must be nugged.\" This statement negates the second part of the disjunction in Statement 1.\n\nSince we know the second part of the disjunction (the shank must be nugged) is false, the only remaining option that satisfies the original disjunction is the first part: the shank must be plooked. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
