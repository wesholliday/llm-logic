This is a classic example of a disjunction, meaning \"or\".  \n\nThe question asks if we can infer that the book *must* have been on the shelf *or* it *must* have been in the backpack.  \n\nThe word \"must\" implies certainty. The original statement doesn't offer certainty, only possibilities. It's entirely possible that the book was in neither location.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
