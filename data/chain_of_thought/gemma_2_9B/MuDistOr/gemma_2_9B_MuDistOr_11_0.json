This means it's asserting that the exam couldn't have been both multiple choice *and* essay-based.  \n\nThe question asks if we can infer that the exam *must* have been one or the other.  Since the original statement already establishes this exclusivity, the inference is valid. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
