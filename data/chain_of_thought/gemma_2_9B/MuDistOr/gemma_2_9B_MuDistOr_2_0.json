These are mutually exclusive options, meaning they cannot both be true at the same time.  \n\nThe rephrased statement also presents two possibilities, but it's phrased as a disjunction, meaning \"either this or that\".  \n\nSince the original statement already covers all the possibilities, the rephrased statement is logically equivalent to the original. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
