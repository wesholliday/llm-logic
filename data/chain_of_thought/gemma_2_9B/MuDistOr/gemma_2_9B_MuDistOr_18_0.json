The product was recyclable.\n\nThe statement doesn't exclude the possibility of the product being both eco-friendly and recyclable.  \n\nThe question asks if we can infer that the product *must* have been either eco-friendly *or* recyclable, meaning at least one of those two things must be true.  \n\nSince the original statement already covers this, we can indeed infer that.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
