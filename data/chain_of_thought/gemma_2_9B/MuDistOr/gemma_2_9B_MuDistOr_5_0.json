A disjunction is a logical statement that asserts that at least one of two (or more) propositions is true.  \n\nIn this case, the propositions are:\n\n* The meeting must have been on Monday.\n* The meeting must have been on Tuesday.\n\nThe statement doesn't say *either* proposition *must* be true, but that *at least one* of them must be true.  \n\nTherefore, it is logically valid to infer that \"The meeting must have been on Monday or it must have been on Tuesday\". \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
