This indicates that at least one of the two options must be true for the candidate to be considered.  \n\nIt doesn't necessarily mean that *both* a degree and relevant work experience are required.  \n\nTherefore, we can infer that the candidate must have had a degree *or* they must have had relevant work experience. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
