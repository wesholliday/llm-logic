The building had wheelchair ramps.\n\nThe statement doesn't say *both* had to be present, just that *at least one* of them must have been there.  \n\nTherefore, we can't definitively say that the building *must* have had an elevator *or* it *must* have had wheelchair ramps. It's possible the building had both, or it's possible it had just one of them.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
