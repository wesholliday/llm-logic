This is a classic example of a disjunction, meaning \"either...or\".  \n\nThe question asks if we can infer that *at least one* of those possibilities must be true.  Since the original statement already asserts that *one* of those possibilities *must* be true (otherwise, it wouldn't be a statement of certainty), the answer is yes. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
