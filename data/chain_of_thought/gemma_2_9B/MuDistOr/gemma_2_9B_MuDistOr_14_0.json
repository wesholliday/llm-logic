This means it presents two or more alternatives that are mutually exclusive (only one can be true) and collectively exhaustive (one of them must be true).  \n\nWhen we rephrase it as \"The payment must have been made by credit card or it must have been made by bank transfer,\" we are essentially restating the original statement in a slightly different way.  Both versions convey the same meaning: the payment had to be made using one of these two methods.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
