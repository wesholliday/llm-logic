It doesn't definitively say it's not bimmed, just that it's a possibility.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"Either the wug must be bimmed or it is flooped.\"** This statement presents a disjunction. It claims that the wug must be either bimmed or flooped; there's no other option.\n\nNow, let's consider the relationship between these statements:\n\nIf we assume the wug is not bimmed (as suggested by Statement 1), then Statement 2 forces us to conclude that the wug must be flooped. This is because the disjunction in Statement 2 leaves no other possibility.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
