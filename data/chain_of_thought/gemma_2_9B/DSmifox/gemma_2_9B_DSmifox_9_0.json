It doesn't definitively say it's not plinked, just that it's a possibility.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"Either the twonk must be plinked or it is varnished.\"** This statement presents a disjunction. It means one of two things must be true: either the twonk is plinked, or the twonk is varnished. There's no middle ground.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n* If the twonk *is* plinked, Statement 2 is satisfied.\n* If the twonk *is not* plinked, then according to Statement 2, it *must* be varnished.\n\nSince Statement 1 allows for the possibility that the twonk is not plinked, and Statement 2 dictates that if it's not plinked, it must be varnished, we can conclude:\n\nAnswer: yes \n\n\n",
