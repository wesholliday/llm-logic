It doesn't definitively say it's not spened, just that it's a possibility.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"Either the dreb must be spened or it is vroombed.\"** This statement presents a disjunction. It claims that the dreb must fulfill one of two conditions: it must be spened, or it must be vroombed. There's no middle ground.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n* If the dreb *is* spened, then Statement 2 is satisfied.\n* If the dreb *is not* spened, then Statement 2 *requires* it to be vroombed.\n\nSince Statement 1 allows for the possibility that the dreb is not spened, and Statement 2 dictates that if it's not spened, it must be vroombed, we can logically conclude that the dreb must be vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
