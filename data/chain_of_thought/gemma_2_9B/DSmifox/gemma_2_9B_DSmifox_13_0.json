It doesn't say it definitely isn't.\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged\" - This presents a disjunction (or). It states that one of two things *must* be true: the glip is tragged, or the glip is slogged.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship:\n\n* If the glip *were* tragged, Statement 2 would be satisfied.\n* If the glip *is not* tragged, then according to Statement 2, it *must* be slogged.\n\nSince Statement 1 allows for the possibility that the glip is not tragged, and Statement 2 dictates that if it's not tragged, it must be slogged, we can conclude...\n\nAnswer: yes \n\n\n",
