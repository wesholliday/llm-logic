This means one of two things *must* be true: either the grommet is plopped, or it is sploffed.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n* If the grommet *were* plopped, Statement 2 would be satisfied.\n* If the grommet *is not* plopped, then according to Statement 2, it *must* be sploffed.\n\nSince Statement 1 allows for the possibility that the grommet is not plopped, and Statement 2 dictates that if it's not plopped, it must be sploffed, we can conclude...\n\nAnswer: yes \n\n\n",
