A conditional statement has the form \"If P, then Q\". In this case:\n    * P: The doll was plastic.\n    * Q: The truck was metal.\n\n* **The Flaw:**  Affirming the consequent means assuming that because Q (the truck was metal) is true, then P (the doll was plastic) must also be true.  This is not necessarily the case.\n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine a scenario where the truck is metal, but the doll is made of wood. This scenario satisfies the second statement (\"The truck was metal\") but not the first (\"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\").\n\n**Answer:** no \n\n\n",
