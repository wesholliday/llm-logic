It says that *if* a certain condition is true (the cake was chocolate), *then* another condition must also be true (the muffins were blueberry).\n\n* **The Flaw:**  Affirming the consequent means assuming that because the consequent (the muffins were blueberry) is true, the antecedent (the cake was chocolate) must also be true.  This is not necessarily the case.\n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine a scenario where the cake was vanilla, but the muffins were blueberry. This satisfies the second statement but not the first.\n\n**Answer:** no \n\n\n",
