A conditional statement has the form \"If P, then Q\". In our case:\n    * P: The bear was in the cave.\n    * Q: The wolf was in the den.\n\n* **The Flaw:**  Affirming the consequent means assuming that because Q (the wolf was in the den) is true, then P (the bear was in the cave) must also be true.  This is not necessarily the case.\n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine a scenario where the wolf is in the den for a reason unrelated to the bear. Perhaps there's a separate entrance to the den, or the wolf simply wandered in.\n\n**Answer:** no \n",
