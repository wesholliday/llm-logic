            "content": "\n\nExplanation: \nThis is a classic example of a logical fallacy called \"affirming the consequent\". \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Understanding the Implication:** The first statement sets up a conditional relationship: If the apple is red, then the banana is yellow. This doesn't mean that *only* if the apple is red is the banana yellow; it could be that the banana is yellow for other reasons.\n\n* **The Flaw:** The second statement tells us the banana *was* yellow.  While this supports the possibility that the apple was red (because it fits the conditional), it doesn't *guarantee* it. There could have been other reasons for the banana to be yellow.\n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine a scenario where the apple was green, but the banana was yellow because it was overripe. This shows that a yellow banana doesn't automatically mean a red apple.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
