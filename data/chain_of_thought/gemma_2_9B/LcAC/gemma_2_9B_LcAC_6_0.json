It tells us something about the relationship between Sue's choice and Bob's choice, but it doesn't guarantee anything about Sue's choice if we only know Bob's choice.\n\nHere's why we can't conclude Sue chose pizza:\n\n* **The conditional statement only works one way.** It tells us that IF Sue chose pizza, THEN Bob chose pasta. It doesn't say anything about what happens if Bob chose pasta but Sue didn't.\n\n* **There could be other possibilities.**  Maybe Sue chose salad, or tacos, or something else entirely. Bob choosing pasta doesn't give us enough information to determine what Sue chose.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
