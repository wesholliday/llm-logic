If P, then Q (Conditional statement)\n2. P (Affirmation of the antecedent)\n\nThen we can logically conclude:\n\nQ (Conclusion)\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The vampire was awake\n* Q: The mummy was awake\n\n* Premise 1: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n* Premise 2: The mummy was awake.\n\nSince we have both the conditional statement and the affirmation of the antecedent, we can apply Modus Ponens and conclude that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: yes \n\n\n",
