This means the snorkel could be either flibbit wibble, flump wibble, or both.  The question asks if we can infer \"The snorkel might be flibbit wibble or it might be flump wibble\". This statement is saying the snorkel could be flibbit wibble, flump wibble, or neither.  \n\nSince the original statement already covers the possibility of the snorkel being either flibbit wibble or flump wibble, we can definitely infer that. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
