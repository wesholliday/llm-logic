This means that either the first possibility is true, or the second possibility is true, or both could be true.  \n\nThe question asks if we can infer that the snizzle might be plimp on bimboozle *or* that it might be zibber for flibbit zazzle.  \n\nSince the original sentence already states both of these possibilities, the answer is yes. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
