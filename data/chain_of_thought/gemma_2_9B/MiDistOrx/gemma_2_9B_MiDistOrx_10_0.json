A disjunction is a logical statement that asserts that at least one of the propositions it connects is true.  \n\nIn this case, the propositions are \"The flump might be flim\" and \"The flump might be shimble\".  The original statement is saying that at least one of these propositions is true, but it doesn't say anything about whether both could be true or if either one must be true.\n\nThe statement \"The flump might be flim or it might be shimble\" is also a disjunction, but it's phrased in a way that emphasizes the possibility of each proposition separately.  \n\nSince the original statement already covers the possibility of either proposition being true, the rephrased statement doesn't add any new information. \n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
