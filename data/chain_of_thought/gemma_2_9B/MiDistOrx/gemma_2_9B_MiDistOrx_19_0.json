This means that there are two possibilities: the zump is zibble quank, or the zump is in wobble.  The word \"or\" indicates a disjunction, meaning either one possibility is true, but not both.\n\nThe rephrased sentence correctly captures this meaning. It separates the two possibilities with \"or\" and avoids implying that both could be true.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n\n\n",
