A disjunction is a logical statement that asserts that at least one of the alternatives is true.  \n\nIn this case, the alternatives are \"the froodle might be flump\" and \"the froodle might be fribble\".  The original statement doesn't say anything about whether one alternative is more likely than the other, or if both could be true. It simply states that at least one of them *might* be true.\n\nTherefore, we can definitely infer that \"The froodle might be flump or it might be fribble\" is a logically equivalent rephrasing of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
