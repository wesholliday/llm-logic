The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order.  \n\nA key rule in logic is that a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and they are logically equivalent, the argument is **logically valid**. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
