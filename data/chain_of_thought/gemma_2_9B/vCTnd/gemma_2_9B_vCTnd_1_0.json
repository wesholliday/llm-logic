The premise says if it's raining, it's *not* hard, while the conclusion says if it's raining hard, it's *not* raining. These are essentially negations of each other.\n\nHowever, the argument doesn't directly prove the conclusion.  The premise only tells us something about the relationship between rain and hard rain, not about the possibility of hard rain existing independently.\n\nConsider a scenario where it's not raining at all. The premise wouldn't be violated, but the conclusion would be false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
