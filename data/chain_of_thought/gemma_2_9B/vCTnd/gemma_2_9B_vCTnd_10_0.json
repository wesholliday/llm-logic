This can be represented symbolically as:\n\n* P \u2192 \u00acH  (If advice was offered (P), then it was not helpful (\u00acH))\n\nThe conclusion states that if helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered at all. This can be represented symbolically as:\n\n* H \u2192 \u00acP (If helpful advice was offered (H), then advice was not offered (\u00acP))\n\nNow, to determine logical validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise.  \n\nNotice that the conclusion is essentially the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order.  \n\nThe contrapositive of P \u2192 \u00acH is \u00acH \u2192 \u00acP.  \n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, they are logically equivalent.  \n\nTherefore, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true. This means the argument is **logically valid**.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
