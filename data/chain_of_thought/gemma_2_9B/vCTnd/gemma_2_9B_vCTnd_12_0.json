The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order.  \n\nIn logic, a valid argument means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.  Importantly, the contrapositive of a true statement is always also true.\n\nTherefore, since the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and the premise is given as true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
