The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order.  \n\nA key principle in logic is that a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they always have the same truth value.  \n\nSince the argument's conclusion is the contrapositive of its premise, they are logically equivalent.  Therefore, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
