The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order.  \n\nIn logic, a valid argument means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.  The key here is that the contrapositive of a true statement is always also true.\n\nTherefore, if the premise \"If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently\" is true, then its contrapositive, \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study,\" must also be true.\n\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
