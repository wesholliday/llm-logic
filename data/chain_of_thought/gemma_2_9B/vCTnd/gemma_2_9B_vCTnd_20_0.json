This can be represented symbolically as P \u2192 \u00acQ, where P represents \"a recommendation was made\" and Q represents \"it was a strong recommendation.\"\n\n* **Conclusion:** If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made. This can be represented symbolically as Q \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nNotice that the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise.  The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order.  \n\nA key rule in logic is that a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they always have the same truth value.  \n\nSince the argument's conclusion is the contrapositive of its premise, the argument is **logically valid**. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
