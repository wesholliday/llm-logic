A contrapositive argument is a type of logical argument where the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion of the original statement and then reversing their order.\n\nLet's break down the original premise:\n\n* **Premise:** If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables.\n\nThe contrapositive of this statement would be:\n\n* **Contrapositive:** If I did not buy vegetables, then I did not go to the store.\n\nNotice that the conclusion of the given argument is indeed the contrapositive of the premise.\n\nNow, a key principle in logic is that a valid argument's conclusion must necessarily follow from its premise(s).  Since the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and contrapositives are logically equivalent to the original statement, the argument is **logically valid**.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
