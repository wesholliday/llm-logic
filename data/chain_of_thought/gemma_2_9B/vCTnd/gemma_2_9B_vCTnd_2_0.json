The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order.  \n\nIn logic, a statement and its contrapositive are always logically equivalent. This means that if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\nSince the argument's conclusion is the contrapositive of its premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
