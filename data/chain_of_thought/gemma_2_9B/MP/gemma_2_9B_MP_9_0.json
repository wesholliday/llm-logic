            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nThis is a classic example of a syllogism, a type of logical argument that applies deductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion based on two or more propositions (premises).\n\n* **Premise 1:** If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. (Conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** Lisa bought the red shirt. (Assertive statement)\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'Mark bought the blue shirt', we need to analyze the relationship between the premises. The first premise establishes a conditional relationship: the buying of the red shirt by Lisa is a *sufficient condition* for Mark buying the blue shirt.  \n\nSince the second premise confirms that Lisa did buy the red shirt, the conditional statement tells us that Mark must have bought the blue shirt as a consequence.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
