            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nThis is a classic example of a syllogism, a type of logical argument that applies deductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion based on two or more propositions (premises). \n\nLet's break down the premises:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. (This is a conditional statement, often written as \"If P, then Q\")\n* **Premise 2:** The book was written by James. (This is a factual statement)\n\nThe conclusion we're trying to reach is: The book is a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of syllogistic reasoning:\n\n1. **Modus Ponens:** This rule of inference states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\n2. In our case, Premise 1 provides the conditional statement, and Premise 2 confirms the antecedent (\"The book was written by James\").\n\nTherefore, according to the rule of Modus Ponens, we can logically conclude that the consequent (\"The book is a mystery novel\") must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
