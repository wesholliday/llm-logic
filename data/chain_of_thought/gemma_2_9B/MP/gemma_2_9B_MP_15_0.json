(Conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** Sam took a plane. (Factual statement)\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'Erin took a train', we need to analyze the structure of the conditional statement. A conditional statement has the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is the hypothesis and Q is the conclusion.  \n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: Sam took a plane\n* Q: Erin took a train\n\nSince we know P is true (Sam took a plane), and the conditional statement tells us that if P is true, then Q must also be true.  \n\nTherefore, we can logically conclude that Erin took a train.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
