It sets up a relationship where the truth of one statement (the car being red) guarantees the truth of another (the truck being blue).\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The car was red.\" This is a factual statement that tells us the first part of the conditional statement is true.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \"The truck was blue.\" This is what we're trying to determine.\n\nSince the first premise establishes a direct link between the car being red and the truck being blue, and we know the car was red (premise 2), we can logically conclude that the truck must have been blue.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
