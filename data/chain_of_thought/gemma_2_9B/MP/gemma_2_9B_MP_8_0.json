(Conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** The vampire was awake. (Affirming the antecedent)\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'The mummy was awake', we need to analyze the structure of the premises and the rules of logic.\n\nThe first premise establishes a conditional relationship: the awakening of the vampire is a necessary condition for the awakening of the mummy.  The second premise tells us that the antecedent (the vampire being awake) is true.\n\nAccording to the rules of syllogistic logic, if the antecedent of a conditional statement is true, then the consequent (the statement that follows 'then') must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can logically conclude that the mummy was awake.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
