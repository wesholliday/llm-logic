(This is a conditional statement)\n2. **Premise 2:** The apple was red. (This is a factual statement)\n\nTo apply deductive reasoning, we need to see if the premises logically lead to a certain conclusion.  Since the first premise establishes a direct relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana (if one is red, the other is yellow), and we know the apple was red (premise 2), we can logically conclude that the banana must have been yellow.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
