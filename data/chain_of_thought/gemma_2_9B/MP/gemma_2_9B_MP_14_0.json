(Conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** The bear was in the cave. (Factual statement)\n\nTo determine if we can infer the conclusion, we need to analyze the relationship between the premises. The first premise establishes a conditional relationship: the occurrence of one event (bear in the cave) guarantees the occurrence of another event (wolf in the den).\n\nSince the second premise confirms that the bear *was* in the cave, the conditional statement in the first premise is triggered.  Therefore, we can logically conclude that the wolf *must* have been in the den.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
