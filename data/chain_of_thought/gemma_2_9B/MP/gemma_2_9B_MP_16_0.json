(Conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** The shirt was cotton. (Affirming the antecedent)\n\nTo determine if we can infer the conclusion, we need to understand the structure of conditional statements. A conditional statement has the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is the antecedent (the \"if\" part) and Q is the consequent (the \"then\" part).\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The shirt was cotton\n* Q: The pants were denim\n\nPremise 1 tells us that if P is true, then Q must also be true. Premise 2 tells us that P is indeed true.  \n\nSince the antecedent (P) is true, and the conditional statement (Premise 1) holds, we can logically deduce that the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
