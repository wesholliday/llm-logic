(Conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** Joe went to the park. (Factual statement)\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'Lucy went to the zoo', we need to analyze the structure of the premises. The first premise establishes a conditional relationship: the first part (antecedent) is 'Joe went to the park', and the second part (consequent) is 'Lucy went to the zoo'.  \n\nSince the second premise confirms that 'Joe went to the park' (the antecedent), the conditional statement dictates that the consequent, 'Lucy went to the zoo', must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
