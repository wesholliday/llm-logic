            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nThis is a classic example of a syllogism, a type of logical argument that applies deductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion based on two or more propositions (premises). \n\nLet's break down the premises:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. (This is a conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** Tom watched football. (This is a factual statement)\n\nThe structure of this argument follows the pattern of a modus ponens syllogism. Modus ponens is a valid form of deductive reasoning where:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement (If P, then Q)\n2. We know P is true.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P = Tom watched football\n* Q = Jen watched basketball\n\nSince we know both the conditional statement is true and that P (Tom watched football) is true, we can logically deduce that Q (Jen watched basketball) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
