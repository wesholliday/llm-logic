We have a conditional statement (\"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\") and a statement that affirms the antecedent of the conditional (\"Alex finished the race\").  \n\nThe rule of inference that applies here is called \"Modus Ponens\". Modus Ponens states that if we have a conditional statement and the antecedent is true, then the consequent is also true.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* The conditional statement is: If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n* The antecedent (the \"if\" part) is true: Alex finished the race.\n\nTherefore, according to Modus Ponens, we can conclude that the consequent (the \"then\" part) is also true: Chris finished the race. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
