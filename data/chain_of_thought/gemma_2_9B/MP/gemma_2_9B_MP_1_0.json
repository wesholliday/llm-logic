(This is a conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** Mary was at the wedding. (This is a factual statement)\n\nSince the first premise establishes a direct link between Mary's presence and Sue's presence at the wedding, and we know from the second premise that Mary was indeed at the wedding, we can logically conclude that Sue must also have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
