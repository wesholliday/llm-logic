(This is a conditional statement)\n2. **Premise 2:** The cake was chocolate. (This is a factual statement)\n\nTo apply deductive reasoning, we need to see if the premises logically lead to a certain conclusion.  Since Premise 1 states that *if* the cake was chocolate, *then* the muffins were blueberry, and Premise 2 confirms that the cake *was* chocolate, we can conclude that the muffins *must* have been blueberry.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
