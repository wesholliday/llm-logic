It says that *if* a certain condition is true (the car is red), *then* another condition must also be true (the truck is blue).\n\n* **The Flaw:**  Affirming the consequent means assuming that because the consequent (the truck being blue) is true, the antecedent (the car being red) must also be true.  This is not necessarily the case.\n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine a scenario where the car is green, but the truck is still blue. This scenario satisfies the original statement (if the car was red, then the truck was blue) even though the car wasn't red.\n\n**Answer:** no \n\n\n",
