(This is a conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** The unicorn was in the forest. (This is a factual statement)\n\n*Modus ponens* states that if we have a conditional statement and the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is true, we can conclude that the consequent (the \"then\" part) is also true.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* The antecedent of our conditional statement is \"the griffin was in the forest\".\n* We don't know if the antecedent is true or false.\n\nHowever, the second premise tells us that the consequent (\"the unicorn was in the forest\") is true.  Since *modus ponens* only allows us to conclude the consequent is true *if* the antecedent is also true, we cannot definitively say that the griffin was in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
