A conditional statement has the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is the hypothesis (the \"if\" part) and Q is the conclusion (the \"then\" part).\n\n* **The Flaw:**  In this case, our conditional statement is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\".  Affirming the consequent means assuming that because the conclusion (pants were denim) is true, the hypothesis (shirt was cotton) must also be true.\n\n* **Counterexamples:** This logic is flawed because there could be other reasons why the pants were denim.  For example:\n    * The pants could have been made of denim regardless of the shirt's material.\n\n**Answer:** no \n",
