It tells us something about the relationship between Sue's choice and Bob's choice, but it doesn't guarantee anything about Sue's choice if we only know Bob's choice.\n\nHere's why we can't deduce that Sue chose pizza:\n\n* **The conditional statement only works one way.** It tells us what happens *if* Sue chose pizza, but it doesn't say anything about what happens if Bob chose pasta.  There could be other reasons why Bob chose pasta.\n\n* **Counterexamples:**  We can easily imagine scenarios where Bob chose pasta but Sue didn't choose pizza. For example, maybe Sue chose salad.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
