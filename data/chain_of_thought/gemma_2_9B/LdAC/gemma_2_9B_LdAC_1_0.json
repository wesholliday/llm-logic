We have two statements:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the first part (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This is a simple statement of fact.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can conclude that Mary was at the wedding.  \n\nThe key here is to understand the nature of conditional statements.  A conditional statement doesn't automatically mean the reverse is true. Just because Sue was at the wedding doesn't necessarily mean Mary was also there.  \n\nThink of it this way:\n\n* If it's raining (Mary at the wedding), then the ground is wet (Sue at the wedding).  We know the ground is wet (Sue is at the wedding), but that doesn't tell us for sure if it's raining (Mary is at the wedding). It could be wet for other reasons.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
