            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nLet's break down the statements:\n\n* **Statement 1:** \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement. It means that if the first part (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the second part (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This statement is saying that we can't definitively say Mark bought the blue shirt. It could be true, but it's not a certainty.\n\nNow, let's think about the implications:\n\n* If Lisa *did* buy the red shirt, then according to Statement 1, Mark *must* have bought the blue shirt.\n\n* However, Statement 2 tells us we can't be sure Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nThis creates a contradiction. If Lisa bought the red shirt, it would force Mark to buy the blue shirt, which we know isn't a certainty.\n\nTherefore, the only way to resolve this contradiction is if Lisa did *not* buy the red shirt.\n\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
