Understand the Statements:**\n\n* **Statement 1:** \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\" This is a conditional statement. It implies that if the first part (the cake being chocolate) is true, then the second part (the muffins being blueberry) must also be true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\" This statement is saying that we cannot definitively conclude that the muffins were blueberry.\n\n**2. Analyze the Relationship:**\n\n* Notice that Statement 2 contradicts the consequence of Statement 1. If the cake *was* chocolate, Statement 1 tells us the muffins *must* have been blueberry. But Statement 2 says we can't be sure the muffins were blueberry.\n\n**3. Apply Logic:**\n\n*  The only way for Statement 2 to be true while also respecting the implication of Statement 1 is if the first part of Statement 1 (the cake being chocolate) is false. \n\nExplanation: \nAnswer: yes",
