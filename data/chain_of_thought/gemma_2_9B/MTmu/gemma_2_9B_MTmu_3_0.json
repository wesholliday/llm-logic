            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nLet's break down the statements:\n\n* **Statement 1:** \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\" This is a conditional statement. It sets up a rule: if the antecedent (the book was written by James) is true, then the consequent (the book must be a mystery novel) is also true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\" This statement tells us that the book is *not* necessarily a mystery novel. It could be something else.\n\nNow, let's think about the logical relationship between these statements and the conclusion we want to reach:\n\n* **Conclusion:** \"The book was not written by James.\"\n\nWe can use a technique called \"proof by contradiction\" to see if this conclusion follows logically.\n\n1. **Assume the opposite of the conclusion:** Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that the book *was* written by James.\n\n2. **Analyze the implications:** If the book was written by James, according to Statement 1, it *must* be a mystery novel.\n\n3. **Contradiction:** But Statement 2 tells us that the book is *not* necessarily a mystery novel. This creates a contradiction!\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since our assumption leads to a contradiction, it must be false. Therefore, the book was not written by James.\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes",
