            "content": "\\\nHere's how to approach this problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Statements:**\n\n* **Statement 1:** \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" This is a conditional statement. It implies that if the first part (the doll being plastic) is true, then the second part (the truck being metal) must also be true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\" This statement negates the conclusion of the conditional statement. It means that we cannot definitively say the truck had to be metal.\n\n**2. Analyze the Relationship:**\n\n* The key here is to recognize that the second statement weakens the connection between the doll being plastic and the truck being metal.  \n\n* Since we know the truck *doesn't have to* be metal, it means there could be other possibilities for the truck's material.\n\n**3.  Consider the Inference:**\n\n* The question asks if we can infer that the doll was *not* plastic.  \n\n* If the truck *doesn't have to* be metal, then the original conditional statement doesn't necessarily hold true. This means the doll could have been plastic without the truck being metal.\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
