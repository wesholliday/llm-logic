Understand the Statements:**\n\n* **Statement 1:** \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\" This is a conditional statement. It says that if one event (alien visiting Mars) happens, then another event (robot visiting Jupiter) *must* also happen.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter.\" This statement is saying the opposite of the conclusion of Statement 1. It's denying that the robot's visit to Jupiter is a guaranteed consequence of the alien visiting Mars.\n\n**2.  Identify the Logical Structure:**\n\nThis problem involves a type of logical reasoning called *modus tollens*. Modus tollens is a valid argument form that works like this:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\n**3. Apply Modus Tollens:**\n\nLet's map our statements to the structure of modus tollens:\n\n* P: The alien visited Mars.\n* Q: The robot must have visited Jupiter.\n\n* Statement 1: If P, then Q.\n* Statement 2: Not Q.\n\nTherefore, according to modus tollens, we can conclude:\n\n* Not P.\n\n\nAnswer: yes",
