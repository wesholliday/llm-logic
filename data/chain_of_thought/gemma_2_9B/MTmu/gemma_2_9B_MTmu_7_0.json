It means that if the hypothesis (Alex finishing the race) is true, then the conclusion (Chris finishing the race) must also be true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race.\" This statement is saying that we cannot definitively say Chris finished the race. It's possible he didn't.\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications:\n\n* If Alex *did* finish the race, then according to Statement 1, Chris *must* have finished the race as well.\n\n* However, Statement 2 tells us we can't be sure Chris finished.\n\nThis creates a contradiction.  The only way to resolve this contradiction is if Alex did *not* finish the race. If Alex didn't finish, then the first statement's condition is not met, and we are not obligated to say anything about Chris finishing.\n\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
