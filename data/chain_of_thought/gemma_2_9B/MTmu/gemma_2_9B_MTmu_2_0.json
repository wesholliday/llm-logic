(This is a conditional statement)\n* **Statement 2:** It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest. (This statement is negating the necessity of the unicorn being in the forest)\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications:\n\n* **Statement 1** tells us that the presence of the griffin guarantees the presence of the unicorn in the forest.\n* **Statement 2** tells us that the unicorn's presence in the forest is not a certainty.\n\nTherefore, if the unicorn's presence is not guaranteed, then the griffin's presence cannot be guaranteed either.  \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
