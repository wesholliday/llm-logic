            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nLet's break down the statements:\n\n* **Statement 1:** \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\" This is a conditional statement. It means that if the first part (Sue chose pizza) is true, then the second part (Bob must have chosen pasta) must also be true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.\" This statement is saying that we cannot definitively say Bob chose pasta. It's possible he chose something else.\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications:\n\n* If Sue *did* choose pizza, then according to Statement 1, Bob *must* have chosen pasta.  \n* However, Statement 2 tells us we can't be sure Bob chose pasta.\n\nThis creates a contradiction.  If Sue chose pizza, it would force Bob to choose pasta, but we know that's not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, the only way to resolve this contradiction is if Sue did *not* choose pizza.\n\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
