            "content": "\\\nHere's how to approach this problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Statements:**\n\n* **Statement 1:** \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\" This is a conditional statement. It sets up a cause-and-effect relationship: if the first part (car being red) is true, then the second part (truck being blue) must also be true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\" This statement negates the consequence of the conditional statement. It tells us that the truck being blue is not a guaranteed outcome.\n\n**2. Analyze the Logic:**\n\n* Since the consequence of the first statement (truck being blue) is not guaranteed (Statement 2), we know that the antecedent (car being red) might not be true.\n\n*  The negation of a conditional statement is \"The antecedent is true, but the consequent is false.\"\n\n**3.  Draw the Conclusion:**\n\n*  Because the truck not being blue means the car might not have been red, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes",
