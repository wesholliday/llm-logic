            "content": "\\\nHere's how to approach this problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Statements:**\n\n* **Statement 1:** \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\" This is a conditional statement. It means that if the first part (the vampire being awake) is true, then the second part (the mummy being awake) must also be true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\" This statement is saying the opposite of \"the mummy must have been awake.\" It means it's possible the mummy was not awake.\n\n**2. Analyze the Logic:**\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude that the vampire was not awake.  Let's break down the possibilities:\n\n* **Possibility 1: The vampire was awake.**  If this were true, then according to Statement 1, the mummy must have been awake. This contradicts Statement 2, which says the mummy might not have been awake. So, this possibility is ruled out.\n\n* **Possibility 2: The vampire was not awake.** This possibility doesn't violate either statement.\n\n**3. Conclusion:**\n\nSince the only possibility that doesn't create a contradiction is that the vampire was not awake, we can infer this to be true.\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
