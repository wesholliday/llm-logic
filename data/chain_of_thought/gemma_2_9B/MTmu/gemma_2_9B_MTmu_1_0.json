            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nLet's break down the statements:\n\n* **Statement 1:** \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This is a conditional statement. It means that if the first part (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This statement is saying that we cannot definitively say Sue was at the wedding. It's possible she wasn't.\n\nNow, let's think about the implications:\n\n* If Mary *was* at the wedding, then according to Statement 1, Sue *must* have been there too. \n* However, Statement 2 tells us we can't be sure Sue was there.\n\nThis creates a contradiction.  The only way to resolve this contradiction is if Mary was *not* at the wedding. If Mary wasn't there, then Statement 1 doesn't apply, and we're free to say that Sue might or might not have been there.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
