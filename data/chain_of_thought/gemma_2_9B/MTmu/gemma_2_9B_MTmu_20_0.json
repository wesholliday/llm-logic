            "content": "\\\nHere's how to approach this problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Statements:**\n\n* **Statement 1:** \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" This is a conditional statement. It implies that if the first part (antecedent) is true, then the second part (consequent) must also be true.\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\" This statement negates the consequent of the first statement.\n\n**2. Analyze the Logic:**\n\n* Since the consequent of the first statement (\"the banana must have been yellow\") is negated in the second statement, we know that the banana was *not* necessarily yellow.\n* This means the antecedent of the first statement (\"the apple was red\") could be false.\n\n**3. Draw the Conclusion:**\n\n* If the antecedent of the first statement is false, then we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes",
