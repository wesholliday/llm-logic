            "content": "\\\nHere's how to approach this problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Statements:**\n\n* **Statement 1:** \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\" This is a conditional statement. It implies that if the shirt is cotton, then denim pants are a necessary consequence.\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\" This statement negates the conclusion of Statement 1. It means that the pants not being denim is a possibility.\n\n**2. Analyze the Relationship:**\n\n* Statement 1 sets up a cause-and-effect relationship: cotton shirt -> denim pants.\n* Statement 2 weakens this relationship by saying that denim pants are not a guaranteed outcome.\n\n**3. Consider the Inference:**\n\n* The question asks if we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.  \n\n**4. Apply Logic:**\n\n* Since Statement 2 tells us the pants *don't have to* be denim, it's possible the shirt is cotton and the pants are something else. \n* We cannot definitively conclude that the shirt was not cotton.\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
