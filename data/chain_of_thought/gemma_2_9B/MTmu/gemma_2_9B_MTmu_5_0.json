It sets up a cause-and-effect relationship: if the first part (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the second part (Amy playing tennis) must also be true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\" This statement tells us that we cannot definitively say Amy played tennis. It's possible she played, but it's also possible she didn't.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n* If Jeff *did* play basketball, then according to Statement 1, Amy *must* have played tennis.  \n* However, Statement 2 says we can't be sure Amy played tennis.\n\nThis creates a contradiction.  The only way to resolve this contradiction is if the first part of the conditional statement (Jeff playing basketball) is false.\n\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
