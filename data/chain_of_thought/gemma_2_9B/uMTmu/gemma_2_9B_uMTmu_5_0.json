(This is a conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis. (This means Amy might have played tennis, but it's not a certainty)\n\n* **What we want to find:** Can we conclude that Jeff did *not* play basketball?\n\nLet's analyze:\n\nThe first premise sets up a relationship: basketball for Jeff implies tennis for Amy.  The second premise tells us we can't be sure about Amy playing tennis.  \n\nSince we don't know for sure if Amy played tennis, we can't definitively say whether or not Jeff played basketball.  The first premise only tells us what *would* happen if Jeff played basketball, not whether or not he actually did.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
