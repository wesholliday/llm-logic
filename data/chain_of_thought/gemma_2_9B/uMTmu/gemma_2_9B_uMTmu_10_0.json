This is a conditional statement (if P, then Q).\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the cat must have been outside. This means there's a possibility the cat was inside.\n\n* **Conclusion:** Can we infer that the dog was not inside?\n\nLet's analyze:\n\nPremise 1 tells us that if the dog is inside, the cat *must* be outside.  However, Premise 2 tells us the cat *doesn't have to* be outside. This means the dog could be inside, and the cat could be inside too.  The premises don't give us enough information to conclude that the dog was not inside. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
