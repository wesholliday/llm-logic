It doesn't say that the shirt *was* cotton, just that *if* it were cotton, the pants would have to be denim.\n\n* Premise 2 tells us that there's another possibility for the pants \u2013 they don't *have* to be denim. This means the pants could be made of something else.\n\nNow, consider the conclusion.  We want to know if we can definitively say the shirt was *not* cotton.  \n\nThe problem is that Premise 2 doesn't directly contradict Premise 1.  It's possible the shirt is cotton and the pants are made of a different material.\n\n**Answer:** No \n\n\n",
