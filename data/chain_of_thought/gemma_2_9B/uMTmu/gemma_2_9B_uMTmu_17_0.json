(This is a conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad. (This means Kate might have eaten something else or nothing at all)\n\n* **Conclusion:** Can we infer that Ben did not eat pasta?\n\nLet's analyze:\n\nThe first premise tells us that eating pasta *implies* eating salad for Kate.  However, the second premise tells us that Kate eating salad is not a *necessity*.  \n\nSince we know Kate didn't *have* to eat salad, it's possible she ate something else or nothing at all, even if Ben ate pasta.  \n\nTherefore, we can't definitively say Ben didn't eat pasta.  \n\nAnswer: no \n",
