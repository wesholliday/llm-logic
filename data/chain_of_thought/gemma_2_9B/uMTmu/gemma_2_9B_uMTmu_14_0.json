This means there could be other scenarios where the wolf isn't in the den.\n\nNow, let's consider the first premise. It sets up a conditional statement: if the bear is in the cave, *then* the wolf is in the den.  Since we know the wolf *doesn't have to* be in the den, it means the first premise's condition might not be met.\n\nTherefore, it's possible the bear wasn't in the cave to begin with.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
