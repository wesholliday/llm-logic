It means that if the first part (vampire awake) is true, then the second part (mummy awake) must also be true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\" This statement tells us that we can't definitively say the mummy was awake. It could have been asleep.\n\nNow, let's think about the implications:\n\n* If the vampire *was* awake, then according to Statement 1, the mummy *must* have been awake. \n* However, Statement 2 tells us the mummy *might not* have been awake.\n\nThis creates a contradiction.  The only way to resolve this contradiction is if the initial assumption (vampire awake) is false.\n\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
