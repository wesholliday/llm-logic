(This is a conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel. (This means the book could be something else).\n\n* **Conclusion:** Can we infer that the book was not written by James?\n\nWe can use a logical reasoning tool called a \"truth table\" to help us visualize this.  However, we can also reason it out:\n\nIf Premise 1 is true, and Premise 2 is also true, then the only way for both to be true is if the book was *not* written by James.  \n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
