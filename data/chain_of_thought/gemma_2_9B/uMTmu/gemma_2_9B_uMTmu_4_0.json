It says that visiting Mars is a *sufficient* condition for the robot visiting Jupiter.  This means if the alien *did* visit Mars, then the robot *must* have visited Jupiter.\n\n* **Premise 2** tells us that the robot visiting Jupiter is *not* a guaranteed event.  There could be other ways for the robot to visit Jupiter besides the alien visiting Mars.\n\nNow, consider the conclusion. We want to know if we can definitively say the alien *didn't* visit Mars.  \n\nThe key here is that the premises don't give us enough information to rule out the possibility of the alien visiting Mars.  \n\n**Here's why:**\n\n*  The robot *could* have visited Jupiter for reasons other than the alien visiting Mars.\n*  The alien *could* have visited Mars, and the robot *could* have visited Jupiter as a result.\n\n**Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the alien did not visit Mars.**\n\nAnswer: no \n",
