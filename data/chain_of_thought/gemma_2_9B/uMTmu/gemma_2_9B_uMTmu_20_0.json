It says that redness of the apple is a *sufficient* condition for the banana to be yellow.  This means if the apple is red, the banana *will* be yellow. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the apple isn't red.\n\n* Premise 2 tells us that there's another possibility for the banana's color besides yellow. This means the banana could be something else, or it could be yellow for reasons other than the apple being red.\n\nNow, consider the conclusion. We want to know if we can definitively say the apple wasn't red.  \n\nSince Premise 1 only tells us what happens *if* the apple is red, and Premise 2 doesn't rule out the apple being red, we can't definitively conclude that the apple wasn't red. \n\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
