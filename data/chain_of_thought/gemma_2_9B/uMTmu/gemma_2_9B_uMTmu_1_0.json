(This is a conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. (This means Sue might have been there, but we can't definitively say she was)\n\n* **What we want to find:** Can we conclude that Mary was not at the wedding?\n\nLet's analyze:\n\nThe first premise tells us that Mary's presence *implies* Sue's presence.  However, the second premise tells us we can't be certain about Sue's presence.  \n\nSince we can't be sure Sue was there, it's possible that Mary wasn't at the wedding either.  The first premise doesn't guarantee Mary's presence if Sue wasn't there.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
