Let's analyze:\n\n* **Premise 2** tells us that there's a possibility Erin took something other than a train. This means the first premise doesn't have to be true.\n\n* Since the first premise is dependent on Sam taking a plane, if we know the first premise might not be true, then we can't definitively say Sam didn't take a plane.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
