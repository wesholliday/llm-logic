It says that the truth of one statement (doll being plastic) guarantees the truth of another (truck being metal).\n\n* **Premise 2** tells us that the truth of the truck being metal is not guaranteed. This means there could be other possibilities for the truck's material.\n\nNow, consider the conclusion. We want to know if we can definitively say the doll was *not* plastic.  \n\nSince Premise 2 weakens the connection between the doll and the truck's material, we can't definitively say the doll wasn't plastic.  It's possible the doll was plastic, and the truck was made of a different material.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
