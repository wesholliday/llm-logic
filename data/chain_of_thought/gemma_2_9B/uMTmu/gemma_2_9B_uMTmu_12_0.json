(This is a conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo. (This means Lucy might have gone to the zoo, but it's not a certainty)\n\n* **Conclusion:** Can we infer that Joe did not go to the park?\n\nWe need to analyze the relationship between the premises.  Premise 1 sets up a possible scenario where Joe going to the park leads to Lucy going to the zoo. However, Premise 2 tells us that Lucy's trip to the zoo is not guaranteed.\n\nSince Lucy's zoo trip isn't a certainty, it doesn't automatically mean Joe didn't go to the park.  There could be other reasons why Lucy didn't go to the zoo, even if Joe did go to the park.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
