This means if Sue picked pizza, Bob *definitely* had to pick pasta.\n\n* **Premise 2** tells us that there's another possibility for Bob's choice besides pasta. This means Bob could have chosen something else.\n\nNow, consider the conclusion.  We want to know if we can definitively say Sue *didn't* choose pizza.  \n\nSince Premise 2 shows there are other options for Bob, it weakens the connection between Sue's choice and Bob's.  We can't be sure Sue didn't choose pizza. It's possible she did, and Bob chose something else.\n\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
