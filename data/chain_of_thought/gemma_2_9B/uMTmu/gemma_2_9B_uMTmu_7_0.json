It means that if the first part (Alex finishing) is true, then the second part (Chris finishing) must also be true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race.\" This statement tells us that we cannot definitively say Chris finished the race. It's possible he didn't.\n\nNow, let's think about the implications:\n\n* If Alex *did* finish the race, then according to Statement 1, Chris *must* have finished as well.  \n* However, Statement 2 tells us we can't be sure Chris finished.\n\nThis creates a contradiction. The only way to resolve this is if Alex did *not* finish the race. If Alex didn't finish, then the first statement doesn't apply, and we're free to say Chris might or might not have finished.\n\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
