            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nHere's how we can break down the logic:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\n* **Conclusion:** Can we infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt?\n\nLet's analyze the premises:\n\n* Premise 1 introduces a conditional statement (if-then). It tells us that buying the red shirt is a *sufficient* condition for Mark buying the blue shirt.  \n\n* Premise 2 tells us that there are other possibilities for Mark besides buying the blue shirt. This means Mark could have bought something else or not bought a shirt at all.\n\nNow, consider the conclusion. We want to know if we can definitively say Lisa *didn't* buy the red shirt.  \n\nSince Premise 2 doesn't directly say anything about Lisa, we can't rule out the possibility that she bought the red shirt.  The fact that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt doesn't automatically mean Lisa didn't buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
