(This is a conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. (This means there's a possibility Jen didn't watch basketball)\n\n* **Conclusion:** Can we infer that Tom did not watch football?\n\nLet's analyze:\n\nPremise 1 tells us that watching football *implies* watching basketball for Jen.  However, Premise 2 tells us that Jen watching basketball is not a guaranteed outcome.  \n\nThis means there are scenarios where Tom could have watched football and Jen didn't watch basketball.  \n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Tom did not watch football. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
