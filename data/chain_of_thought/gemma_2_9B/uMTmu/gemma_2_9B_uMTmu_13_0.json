Let's analyze:\n\n* **Premise 2** tells us that there are scenarios where the truck could be a color other than blue. This means the first premise doesn't have to hold true in all cases.\n\n* Since the first premise is a conditional statement (\"If P, then Q\"),  the truth of the consequent (Q - the truck being blue) doesn't guarantee the truth of the antecedent (P - the car being red).\n\n*  If the truck wasn't blue, it doesn't automatically mean the car was not red. There could be other reasons why the truck wasn't blue.\n\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
