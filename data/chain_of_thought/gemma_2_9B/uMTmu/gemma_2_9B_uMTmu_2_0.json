Let's analyze:\n\n* **Premise 2** tells us that the unicorn's presence in the forest is not guaranteed. It could be in the forest or not.\n\n* **Premise 1** sets up a conditional statement:  If the griffin *is* in the forest, then the unicorn *must* be there too.\n\nSince we know the unicorn's presence isn't guaranteed, it means the first premise doesn't have to hold true.  The griffin could be in the forest, but the unicorn might not be there.\n\nTherefore, we can't definitively say the griffin was *not* in the forest.\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
