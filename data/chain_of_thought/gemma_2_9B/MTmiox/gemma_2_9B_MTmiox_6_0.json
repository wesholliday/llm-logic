It doesn't definitively say it didn't happen.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink.\" This statement establishes a conditional relationship. It says that if the grommet was in a state of being \"sploffed,\" then it necessarily plopped the frink.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Can we infer 'The grommet was not sploffed'?\"\n\nTo answer this, we need to see if the given statements logically lead to the conclusion that the grommet definitely wasn't sploffed.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
