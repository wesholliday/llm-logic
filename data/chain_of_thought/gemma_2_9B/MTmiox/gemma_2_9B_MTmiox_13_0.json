It doesn't definitively say the glip didn't tragged, only that it's a possibility.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged.\"** This statement presents a conditional relationship. It says that if a certain condition (being slogged) is true, then another condition (tragging) must also be true.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The glip was not slogged\"?\n\nThe key here is to think about the structure of the conditional statement.  If we know the consequent (tragging) didn't happen, can we definitively say the antecedent (being slogged) didn't happen?  \n\nThe answer is no.  \n\nHere's why:\n\nThe conditional statement only tells us what happens *if* the glip was slogged. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the glip wasn't slogged. There could be other reasons why the glip might not have tragged, even if it wasn't slogged.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
