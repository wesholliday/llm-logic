It means there's a chance the fleeg was not surned, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that it was.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\" This statement presents a conditional relationship. It says that if the fleeg was bluttered, then surned is a guaranteed consequence.\n\nNow, to determine if we can infer \"The fleeg was not bluttered,\" let's consider the possibilities:\n\n* **Scenario 1:** The fleeg was surned.  \n    * Statement 1 allows for this possibility.\n    * Statement 2 doesn't rule out this scenario.\n\n* **Scenario 2:** The fleeg was not surned.\n    * Statement 1 supports this possibility.\n    * Statement 2 doesn't necessarily mean the fleeg wasn't bluttered in this case.\n\nSince we can't definitively rule out the fleeg being bluttered in either scenario, we cannot infer that \"The fleeg was not bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: no \n",
