It doesn't definitively say it didn't tinkle, just that it's a possibility.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked.\" This statement presents a conditional relationship. It says that if a certain event (the whiffle being shanked) happened, then another event (the whiffle tinkling) must also have happened.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The whiffle was not shanked\"?\n\nTo answer this, we need to think about the logical implications of the statements.  If we assume the whiffle was shanked, then according to statement 2, it must have tinkled. However, statement 1 suggests that the whiffle might not have tinkled.  \n\nThis creates a contradiction.  Therefore, the assumption that the whiffle was shanked must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
