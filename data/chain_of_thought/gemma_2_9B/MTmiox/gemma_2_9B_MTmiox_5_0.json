It doesn't definitively say it wasn't.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger must have been smoogled.\" This statement establishes a conditional relationship. It says that if the zinger is fraggled, then it automatically means it's also smoogled.\n\nNow, to determine if we can infer \"The zinger was not fraggled,\" let's consider the possibilities:\n\n* **Scenario 1: The zinger was smoogled.**  If this is true, Statement 2 doesn't directly contradict it. The zinger could be both fraggled and smoogled.\n\n* **Scenario 2: The zinger was not smoogled.**  If this is true, Statement 2 doesn't tell us anything about whether it was fraggled or not.\n\n* **Scenario 3: The zinger was fraggled.**  If this is true, then according to Statement 2, it *must* have been smoogled. This contradicts Statement 1, which allows for the possibility that the zinger wasn't smoogled.\n\nTherefore, we have a contradiction if we assume the zinger was fraggled. This means our initial assumption must be wrong.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
