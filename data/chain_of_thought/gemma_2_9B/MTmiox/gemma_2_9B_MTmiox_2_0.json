Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that states:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down our statements:\n\n* **P:** The wug was flooped.\n* **Q:** The wug must have bimmed the zoint.\n\n* **Statement 1:** The wug might not have bimmed the zoint. This doesn't directly tell us about the wug being flooped or not.\n* **Statement 2:** If the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint. This is our \"If P, then Q\" statement.\n\n* **Conclusion:** We want to infer \"The wug was not flooped\". This is the \"not P\" part of Modus Tollens.\n\nNow, notice that Statement 1 doesn't provide enough information to directly apply Modus Tollens.  We need to know for sure that the wug *didn't* bim the zoint to conclude that it wasn't flooped. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
