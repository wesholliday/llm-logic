It suggests that it's possible the splat did not quank, but it doesn't definitively say it didn't.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked.\"** This statement presents a conditional relationship. It says that if the splat was morphed, then quanking is a guaranteed consequence.\n\nNow, to determine if we can infer that \"The splat was not morphed,\" we need to consider the implications of both statements.  If we assume the splat *was* morphed, then according to statement 2, it *must* have quanked. However, statement 1 says the splat *might* not have quanked.  These two assumptions create a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the only way to resolve this contradiction is to reject the assumption that the splat was morphed.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
