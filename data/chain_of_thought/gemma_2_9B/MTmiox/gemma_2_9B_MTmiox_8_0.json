It doesn't definitively say the sprocket wasn't daggled, only that it's a possibility.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled.\" This statement presents a conditional relationship. It says that if a certain condition (the sprocket being cranked) is true, then another condition (the sprocket being daggled) must also be true.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Can we infer 'The sprocket was not cranked'?\"\n\nTo answer this, we need to see if the given statements logically lead to the conclusion.  We can use a technique called \"proof by contradiction.\"\n\n1. **Assume the opposite:** Let's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that the sprocket *was* cranked.\n\n2. **Analyze the consequences:** If the sprocket was cranked, according to Statement 2, it *must* have been daggled.\n\n3. **Conflict:** This contradicts Statement 1, which says the sprocket *might* not have been daggled.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since our assumption leads to a contradiction, it must be false. Therefore, the sprocket could not have been cranked.\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
