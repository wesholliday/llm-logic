It doesn't rule out other possibilities.  \n\nThe question asks if we can infer that the keys *might* be in the house *or* the car.  Since the original statement already allows for the possibility of the keys being in the car, and doesn't say anything about them *not* being in the house, it's logical to conclude that they *might* be in either place. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
