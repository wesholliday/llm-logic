It says that *if* a certain condition is met (the book being written by James), *then* a specific outcome occurs (the book being a mystery novel).\n\n2. **Consider the Negation:** We're trying to determine if the book is *not* a mystery novel.  This means we're looking for a scenario where the conclusion of Statement 2 does *not* hold true.\n\n3. **Apply Statement 1:** Statement 1 tells us that the book was *not* written by James. This directly contradicts the condition in Statement 2.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the condition in Statement 2 is not met (the book wasn't written by James), we cannot conclude that the book is a mystery novel.  The conditional statement doesn't tell us anything about the book's genre if it wasn't written by James.\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
