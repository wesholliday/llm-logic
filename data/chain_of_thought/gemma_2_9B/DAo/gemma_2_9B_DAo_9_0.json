Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's apply this to our problem:\n\n* P: Lisa bought the red shirt.\n* Q: Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nWe are given:\n\n* Not P: Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n* Q: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt (this is our \"if P, then Q\" statement).\n\nSince we know Lisa did not buy the red shirt (Not P), and we know that if she had bought the red shirt, Mark would have bought the blue shirt, we can conclude that Mark did not buy the blue shirt (Not Q).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
