This translates to \u00acP (not P)\n\n2. **Premise 2:** If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. This is a conditional statement, written as P \u2192 Q.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** Bob did not choose pasta. This translates to \u00acQ (not Q).\n\nNow, let's see if the premises logically lead to the conclusion:\n\n| P | Q | \u00acP | P \u2192 Q | \u00acQ |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| T | T | F | T | F |\n| T | F | F | F | T |\n| F | T | T | T | F |\n| F | F | T | T | T |\n\nAs you can see, the only scenario where both premises are true is when Sue did not choose pizza (\u00acP) and Bob did not choose pasta (\u00acQ).  \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
