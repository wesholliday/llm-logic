Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's apply this to our problem:\n\n* P: The apple was red.\n* Q: The banana was yellow.\n\nWe are given:\n\n* Not P: The apple was not red.\n* Q: The banana was yellow (implied in the second statement).\n\nSince we have the negation of the consequent (Q) and the original statement (If P, then Q), we can apply modus tollens to conclude the negation of the antecedent (P).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the apple was not red. However, this does not directly tell us anything about the color of the banana.\n\nAnswer: no \n\n\n",
