This is a conditional statement (if P, then Q).\n\n3. **What we want to find:** Can we conclude that Chris did not finish the race?\n\n4. **Analyzing the premises:**  Premise 1 tells us Alex didn't finish. Premise 2 tells us *only* that if Alex *had* finished, then Chris would have finished too. It doesn't say anything about what happens if Alex *doesn't* finish.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**  We can't definitively say Chris didn't finish the race.  Premise 2 only establishes a relationship between Alex finishing and Chris finishing, not the other way around.\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
