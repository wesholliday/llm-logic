Modus Tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know that P is false, then we can conclude that Q is also false.\n\n1. **Identify the statements:**\n    * P: Joe went to the park.\n    * Q: Lucy went to the zoo.\n\n2. **Analyze the given information:**\n    * We are told \"Joe did not go to the park,\" which means P is false.\n    * We are also given \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo,\" which is our conditional statement (If P, then Q).\n\n3. **Apply Modus Tollens:**\n    Since P is false, and we have the conditional statement, we can conclude that Q is also false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
