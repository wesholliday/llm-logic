Not Q. Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's see if our premises fit this pattern:\n\n* P: The doll is plastic\n* Q: The truck is metal\n\n* We know P is false (The doll was not plastic).\n* We don't know if Q is true or false.\n\nSince we can't directly apply modus tollens because we don't know if Q is false, we can't definitively conclude that the truck was not metal. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
