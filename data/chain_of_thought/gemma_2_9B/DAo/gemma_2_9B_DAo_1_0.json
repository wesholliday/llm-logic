This is a conditional statement (if P, then Q).\n\n3. **Inference:** We want to know if we can conclude that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\n4. **Analyzing the Premises:** Since Mary was *not* at the wedding (Premise 1), the condition in Premise 2 is not met.  Because the condition is not met, the consequent (Sue being at the wedding) doesn't have to be true.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** We cannot definitively say that Sue was not at the wedding. The information given doesn't rule out the possibility that Sue was there.\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
