Modus Tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know that Q is false, then we can conclude that P is also false.\n\nLet's break down our statements:\n\n* **P:** The griffin was in the forest.\n* **Q:** The unicorn was in the forest.\n\nWe are given:\n\n* **Statement 1:** The griffin was not in the forest. (This tells us P is false)\n* **Statement 2:** If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. (This is our conditional statement)\n\nSince we know P is false (the griffin wasn't in the forest), and we have the conditional statement, Modus Tollens allows us to conclude that Q must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
