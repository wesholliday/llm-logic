Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's apply this to our problem:\n\n* P: The car was red.\n* Q: The truck was blue.\n\nWe are given:\n\n* Not P: The car was not red.\n* Not Q:  We need to infer this.\n\nSince we know the car was not red (Not P), and we know that if the car was red, the truck would be blue (If P, then Q), we can conclude that the truck was not blue (Not Q).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
