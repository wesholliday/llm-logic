It means that if the first part (Sam taking a plane) were true, then the second part (Erin taking a train) would also be true.\n\nNow, we need to consider the implications of Statement 1. Since Sam *didn't* take a plane, the condition in Statement 2 is not met.  Because the condition isn't met, we can't conclude anything for sure about Erin's travel arrangements.  The statement doesn't say anything about what Erin did if Sam didn't take a plane.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
