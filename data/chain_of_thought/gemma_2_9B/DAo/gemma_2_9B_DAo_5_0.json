            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nWe can use a logical reasoning technique called Modus Tollens to solve this. Modus Tollens states:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down the statements:\n\n* P: Jeff played basketball\n* Q: Amy played tennis\n\n1. **\"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\"**  This is our first statement, which sets up the conditional relationship (P implies Q).\n\n2. **\"Jeff did not play basketball\"** This is our second statement, which tells us that P is false.\n\n3. **\"Therefore, Amy did not play tennis\"**  This is what we want to infer.  Since we know P is false, and we have the conditional statement that if P is true, then Q is true, we can conclude that Q must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
