Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's apply this to our problem:\n\n* P: The vampire was awake.\n* Q: The mummy was awake.\n\nWe are given:\n\n*  \"The vampire was not awake\" (Not P)\n*  \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" (If P, then Q)\n\nSince we have the first two parts of the modus tollens structure, we can conclude the third part.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
