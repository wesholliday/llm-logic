We have two statements:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** The bear was not in the cave.\n2. **Premise 2:** If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude that the wolf was not in the den.  This is a classic example of a logical argument called *modus tollens*.\n\n*Modus tollens* works like this:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's apply this to our statements:\n\n* P: The bear is in the cave.\n* Q: The wolf is in the den.\n\n* **Premise 1** tells us not P (The bear is not in the cave).\n* **Premise 2** tells us that if P were true (the bear was in the cave), then Q would also be true (the wolf would be in the den).\n\nSince the bear is *not* in the cave, we can't be sure if the wolf is in the den or not. Premise 2 only tells us what would happen *if* the bear were in the cave. It doesn't say anything about what happens when the bear is *not* in the cave.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
