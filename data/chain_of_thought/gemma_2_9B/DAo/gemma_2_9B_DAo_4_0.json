Modus Tollens states:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down the statements:\n\n* P: The alien visited Mars.\n* Q: The robot visited Jupiter.\n\n* Statement 1: \"The alien did not visit Mars\" is the negation of P.\n* Statement 2: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" is the \"If P, then Q\" part of Modus Tollens.\n\nSince we have the negation of P and the \"If P, then Q\" part, we can apply Modus Tollens to conclude the negation of Q.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n\n\n",
