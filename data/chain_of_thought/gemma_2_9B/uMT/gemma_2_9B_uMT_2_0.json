This is an example of a logical argument called *modus tollens*.\n\n* **Modus Tollens:** If P, then Q.  Not Q. Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's apply this to our problem:\n\n* P = The griffin was in the forest.\n* Q = The unicorn was in the forest.\n\nWe know Q is false (the unicorn was not in the forest).  Therefore, according to the rule of modus tollens, we can conclude that P must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
