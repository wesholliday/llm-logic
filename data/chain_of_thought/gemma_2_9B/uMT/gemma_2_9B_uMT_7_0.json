This can be represented as \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"Alex finished the race\" and Q is \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\n* **Negation:** Chris did not finish the race. This means Q is false.\n\n* **Inference:** We want to know if we can conclude that Alex did not finish the race (P is false).\n\nSince the conditional statement is \"If P, then Q,\"  the negation of this statement is \"P and not Q.\"  \n\nIf Chris did not finish (Q is false), and the conditional statement is true, then Alex must not have finished (P must be false) to satisfy the negation of the conditional.\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
