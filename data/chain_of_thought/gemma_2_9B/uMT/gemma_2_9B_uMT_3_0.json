(This is a conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** The book is not a mystery novel. (This is a negative statement)\n\n* **Conclusion:** Therefore, the book was not written by James.\n\nThis follows the structure of a *modus tollens* syllogism, which states:\n\nIf P, then Q.\nNot Q.\nTherefore, not P.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P = The book was written by James\n* Q = The book is a mystery novel\n\nSince the book is not a mystery novel (not Q), we can conclude that the book was not written by James (not P). \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
