This is a conditional statement.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** The cat was not outside. This is a direct statement.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** We want to know if we can infer that the dog was not inside.\n\n4. **Applying Logic:**  Since the cat was not outside, and the first premise states that *if* the dog was inside, *then* the cat would have to be outside, we can conclude that the dog must not have been inside.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
