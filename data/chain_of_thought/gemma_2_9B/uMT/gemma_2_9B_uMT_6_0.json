(This is a conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** Bob did not choose pasta.\n\n* **Conclusion:**  We want to know if we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nSince the first premise is a conditional statement, it tells us that if the first part is true (Sue chose pizza), then the second part must also be true (Bob chose pasta).  However, we know the second part is *not* true (Bob didn't choose pasta).  \n\nThis means the first part (Sue chose pizza) must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
