            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nThis is a classic example of a logical argument that uses a conditional statement and its negation. \n\n* **Conditional Statement:** If the bear was in the cave (premise 1), then the wolf was in the den (premise 2).\n\n* **Negation:** We are told the wolf was not in the den (premise 3).\n\nTo determine if we can infer that the bear was not in the cave, we need to apply the concept of *modus tollens*. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states:\n\nIf a conditional statement is true, and the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Conditional Statement True:** We assume the first statement is true (If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den).\n\n2. **Consequent False:** We are given that the wolf was not in the den (the consequent of the conditional statement).\n\n3. **Antecedent False:**  Therefore, according to modus tollens, the antecedent (the bear was in the cave) must also be false.\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
