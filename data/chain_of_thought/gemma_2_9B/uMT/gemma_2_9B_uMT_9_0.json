This is a conditional statement.\n* **Premise 2:** Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This is a fact.\n\n* **Conclusion:**  We want to know if we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nSince Mark didn't buy the blue shirt, and the first premise states that *if* Lisa bought the red shirt, *then* Mark would have bought the blue shirt, we can logically conclude that Lisa must not have bought the red shirt. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
