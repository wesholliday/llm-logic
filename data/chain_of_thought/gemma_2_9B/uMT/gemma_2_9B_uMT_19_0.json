            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nHere's how we can break down the logic:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This is a conditional statement. It means that watching football is a necessary condition for Jen to watch basketball.\n* **Premise 2:** Jen did not watch basketball. This tells us the opposite of what the consequent (the \"then\" part) of the first premise states.\n\n* **Conclusion:** We want to know if we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nSince Jen didn't watch basketball, and the first premise states that Jen *must* watch basketball if Tom watched football, it follows that Tom couldn't have watched football.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
