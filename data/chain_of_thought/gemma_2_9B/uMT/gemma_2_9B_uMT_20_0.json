Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that states:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The apple was red.\n* Q: The banana was yellow.\n\nWe are given:\n\n* If the apple was red (P), then the banana was yellow (Q).\n* The banana was not yellow (not Q).\n\nTherefore, according to Modus Tollens, we can conclude that the apple was not red (not P).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
