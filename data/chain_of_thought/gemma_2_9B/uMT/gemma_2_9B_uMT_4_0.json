Modus tollens is a valid form of deductive reasoning where we negate the consequent of a conditional statement and conclude the negation of the antecedent.\n\nIn simpler terms, because we know the robot didn't go to Jupiter, and we know that *if* the alien went to Mars, *then* the robot would have gone to Jupiter, we can conclude that the alien must not have gone to Mars. \n\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
