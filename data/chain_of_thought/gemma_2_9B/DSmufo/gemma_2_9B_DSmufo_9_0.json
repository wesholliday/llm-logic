It could be somewhere else.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\" This presents two possibilities: the piece is on the floor, or it's in the box.\n\nNow, if we combine these statements, we see:\n\n* We know the piece isn't *definitely* on the floor (Statement 1).\n* We know it *must* be either on the floor or in the box (Statement 2).\n\nTherefore, the only remaining possibility is that the piece must be in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
