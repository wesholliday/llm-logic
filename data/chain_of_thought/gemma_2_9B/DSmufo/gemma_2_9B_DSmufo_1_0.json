There's a possibility he's somewhere else.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside.\" This presents a disjunction, meaning one of two things *must* be true: Fido is in the garden, or Fido is inside.\n\nNow, we want to see if we can conclude that Fido is inside.  \n\nSince Statement 1 tells us Fido doesn't *have* to be in the garden, and Statement 2 says *one* of those two options *must* be true, the only remaining possibility is that Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: yes \n\n\n",
