(This is a conditional statement, meaning it sets up a cause-and-effect relationship)\n* **Premise 2:** Mark bought the blue shirt. (This is a fact)\n\nWe need to determine if we can conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt.  \n\nThe problem is that the first premise only tells us what happens *if* Lisa bought the red shirt. It doesn't say anything about whether or not Lisa actually did buy the red shirt.  \n\nThere could be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt.  \n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
