(Conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** The truck was metal. (Fact)\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude that the doll was plastic.  \n\nThe problem is that the first premise is a conditional statement. It only tells us what happens *if* the doll is plastic. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the truck is metal.  There could be other reasons why the truck is metal.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the doll was plastic based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
