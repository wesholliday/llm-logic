(This is a conditional statement, meaning it sets up a relationship where one event (dog inside) implies another (cat outside).\n* **Premise 2:** The cat was outside. (This is a factual statement.)\n\nThe problem is that we cannot definitively conclude the dog was inside. Here's why:\n\n* **The conditional statement only works one way.**  Just because the cat is outside doesn't automatically mean the dog *must* have been inside. There could be other reasons why the cat is outside.\n\n* **Counterexamples:** Imagine these scenarios:\n    * The dog was outside the whole time.\n    * The dog was in a different location entirely (like the backyard).\n\n**Answer:** no \n",
