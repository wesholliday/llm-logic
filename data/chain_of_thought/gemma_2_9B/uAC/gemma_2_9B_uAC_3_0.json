A syllogism has two premises (statements that are assumed to be true) and a conclusion (a statement that is inferred from the premises).\n\n* **Premise 1:** If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n* **Premise 2:** The book is a mystery novel.\n* **Conclusion:** Can we infer that the book was written by James?\n\nThis syllogism follows a pattern known as \"modus ponens\". Modus ponens states that if we know \"If P, then Q\" and we also know \"Q\", then we can conclude \"P\".\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P = The book was written by James\n* Q = The book is a mystery novel\n\nSince we know both \"If P, then Q\" and \"Q\", we can logically conclude \"P\".\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
