There could be other reasons why the banana is yellow.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n* If it's raining, then the ground is wet. (Conditional statement)\n* The ground is wet. (Given information)\n\nCan we conclude that it *must* be raining? No! The ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled water, etc.).\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
