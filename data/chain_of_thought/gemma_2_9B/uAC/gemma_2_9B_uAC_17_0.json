This is represented as \"If P, then Q\".\n* **Converse:** Kate ate salad, therefore Ben ate pasta. This is represented as \"If Q, then P\".\n\nThe problem states that the first part of the conditional statement is true (Kate ate salad).  However, the converse of a conditional statement is not always true. Just because the consequent (Kate ate salad) is true, it doesn't necessarily mean the antecedent (Ben ate pasta) is also true.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
