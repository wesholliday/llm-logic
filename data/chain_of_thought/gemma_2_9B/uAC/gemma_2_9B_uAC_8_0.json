(This is a conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** The mummy was awake.\n\nWe need to determine if we can conclude that the vampire was also awake.  \n\nThe structure of the argument resembles a  \"modus ponens\" syllogism. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know that Q is true, we can conclude that P is also true.\n\nHowever, in this case, the argument doesn't quite fit perfectly. While the mummy being awake supports the possibility of the vampire being awake, it doesn't definitively prove it.  There could be other reasons why the mummy was awake.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
