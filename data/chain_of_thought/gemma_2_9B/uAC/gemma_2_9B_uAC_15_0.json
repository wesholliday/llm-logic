We need to see if the given information allows us to definitely conclude that Sam took a plane.\n\n* **Premise 1:** If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. (This is a conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** Erin took a train.\n\nWe know Erin took a train.  The first premise tells us that *if* Sam took a plane, *then* Erin would have taken a train. Since Erin did take a train, it seems like Sam *must* have taken a plane.\n\nHowever, there's a catch! The first premise doesn't say *only* if Sam took a plane would Erin take a train.  There could be other reasons why Erin took a train.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
