            "content": "\n\nExplanation: \nThis is a classic example of a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **The original statement sets up a conditional relationship:** \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This means that if the first part (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true.\n\n* **We are given that Sue was at the wedding.** This confirms the second part of the conditional statement.\n\n* **The fallacy:**  Just because the consequent (Sue being at the wedding) is true, it doesn't automatically mean the antecedent (Mary being at the wedding) is also true. There could be other reasons why Sue was at the wedding, even if Mary wasn't.\n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine a different scenario:\n\n* If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\n* The ground is wet.\n\nCan we conclude that it's raining? No! The ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled water, etc.).\n\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
