(This is a conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** The wolf was in the den. (This is a factual statement)\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude that the bear was in the cave.  \n\nThe problem is that the first premise is a conditional statement. It only tells us what happens *if* the bear is in the cave. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the wolf is in the den, regardless of the bear's location.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the bear was in the cave.  \n\nAnswer: no \n",
