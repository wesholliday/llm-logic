(This is a conditional statement, meaning it sets up a cause-and-effect relationship)\n* **Premise 2:** Bob chose pasta. (This is a fact)\n\nWe need to determine if we can conclude that Sue chose pizza based on these premises.  \n\nThe problem is that the first premise only tells us what happens *if* Sue chose pizza. It doesn't say anything about what happens if Bob chooses pasta for other reasons.  \n\nFor example, Bob might have chosen pasta because:\n\n* Sue chose salad.\n* Sue didn't choose anything.\n* Bob simply prefers pasta.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Sue chose pizza just because Bob chose pasta.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
