A disjunction is a logical statement that asserts that at least one of two propositions is true.  \n\nIn this case, the two propositions are:\n\n1. \"The shimble is snizzle plonk\"\n2. \"The shimble is zibber\"\n\nThe original statement implies that *at least one* of these propositions must be true. It doesn't say anything about *both* propositions being false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The shimble must be snizzle plonk or it must be zibber\" is a logically equivalent statement to the original.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
