A disjunction is a logical statement that asserts that at least one of two propositions is true.  \n\nIn this case, the two propositions are:\n\n1. The frazzle is in flibbit.\n2. The frazzle is in frozz.\n\nThe statement implies that the frazzle cannot be in both flibbit and frozz simultaneously.\n\nThe rephrased statement \"The frazzle must be in flibbit or it must be in frozz\" is also a disjunction. It uses slightly different wording but conveys the same meaning.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the two statements are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n\n\n",
