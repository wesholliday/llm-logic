It means the wumble cannot be in both places simultaneously.  \n\nThe rephrased statement \"The wumble must be on the frozz or it must be in the shimble\"  also presents two exclusive possibilities, but it rephrases the original meaning slightly. \n\nThe original statement emphasizes the requirement for the wumble to be in one of the two locations. The rephrased statement emphasizes the necessity of the wumble being in *either* the frozz *or* the shimble,  leaving no other options.\n\nTherefore, the rephrased statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
