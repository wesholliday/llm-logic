The first possibility is that the blimp gribbles a flonk, and the second possibility is that the blimp gribbles a wibble snorkel.  The question asks if we can infer that the blimp *must* gribble a flonk, *or* that it *must* gribble a wibble snorkel.  \n\nSince the original statement says the blimp *must* do one of these things, and it can't do both, we can infer that the blimp *must* gribble a flonk *or* it *must* gribble a wibble snorkel.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
