A disjunction is a logical statement that asserts that at least one of two propositions is true.  \n\nIn this case, the two propositions are:\n\n* The blimple is zump.\n* The blimple is zibber.\n\nThe statement implies that it is impossible for the blimple to be neither zump nor zibber.  \n\nThe rephrased statement \"The blimple must be zump or it must be zibber\" is also a disjunction, and it expresses the same meaning as the original statement.  \n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that the rephrased statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
