A disjunction is a logical statement that asserts that at least one of two propositions is true.  \n\nIn this case, the two propositions are:\n\n* The gronk is wump.\n* The gronk is quibble.\n\nThe statement implies that it is impossible for the gronk to be neither wump nor quibble.\n\nThe rephrased statement \"The gronk must be wump or it must be quibble\" is also a disjunction, and it expresses the same meaning as the original statement.  \n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that the rephrased statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
