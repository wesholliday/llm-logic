If P, then Q.\n2. P.\n3. Therefore, Q.\n\nLet's break down the given statements:\n\n* **Premise 1:** \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\"  This is our \"If P, then Q\" statement.\n* **Premise 2:** \"The wug was flooped.\" This is our \"P\" statement.\n\nSince we have both the \"If P, then Q\" and the \"P\" statement, we can apply modus ponens to conclude \"Q\".\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
