If P, then Q (This is our first statement)\n2. P (This is our second statement)\n\nThen we can logically conclude that Q is true.\n\nLet's break down our example:\n\n* **P:** The sneg was crampled\n* **Q:** The sneg sproted the frink\n\nOur first statement sets up the conditional relationship: If the sneg was crampled (P), then the sneg sproted the frink (Q). Our second statement tells us that the sneg was indeed crampled (P).  \n\nTherefore, according to Modus Ponens, we can logically conclude that the sneg sproted the frink (Q).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
