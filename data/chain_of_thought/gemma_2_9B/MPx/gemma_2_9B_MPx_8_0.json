If P, then Q (conditional statement)\n2. P (affirmation of the antecedent)\n\nThen we can conclude:\n\nQ (affirmation of the consequent)\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n* **Premise 1:** \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\"  This is our conditional statement (P -> Q).\n* **Premise 2:** \"The sprocket was cranked.\" This is the affirmation of the antecedent (P).\n\nSince we have both premises, we can apply modus ponens to conclude:\n\n* **Conclusion:** \"The sprocket was daggled.\" (Q)\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
