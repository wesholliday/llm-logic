(This is a conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** The shank was plooked. (This is a factual statement)\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'The shank was nugged', we need to see if the premises logically support the conclusion.  \n\nSince Premise 1 states that *if* the shank was plooked, *then* it was nugged, and Premise 2 confirms that the shank *was* plooked, we can logically conclude that the shank must also have been nugged.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
