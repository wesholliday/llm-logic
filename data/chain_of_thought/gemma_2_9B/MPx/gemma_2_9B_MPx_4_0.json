It means that if the first part (the antecedent) is true, then the second part (the consequent) must also be true.\n\n* **Premise 2:** \"The fribble was snurgled.\" This is a statement asserting a fact.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can conclude \"The fribble crinked.\"  \n\nSince the first premise tells us that if the fribble was snurgled, it *must* crinkle, and we know the fribble *was* snurgled (premise 2), we can logically conclude that the fribble crinkled.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
