(This is a conditional statement, often represented as \"If P, then Q\")\n* **Premise 2:** The wug was sproinged. (This is a statement asserting that P is true)\n\nThe conclusion we want to infer is: It was garpled (meaning Q is true).\n\nSince the first premise establishes a direct link between sproinging (P) and garpling (Q), and the second premise confirms that the wug was sproinged, we can logically deduce that the wug must have been garpled.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
