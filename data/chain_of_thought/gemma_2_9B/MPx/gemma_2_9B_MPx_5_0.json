(This is a conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** The zinger was fraggled. (This is a factual statement)\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'The zinger was smoogled', we need to see if these premises logically lead to that conclusion.  \n\nSince Premise 1 states that *if* the zinger was fraggled, *then* it was smoogled, and Premise 2 confirms that the zinger *was* fraggled, we can apply the rule of modus ponens. Modus ponens is a valid rule of inference that states:\n\nIf P, then Q.\nP.\nTherefore, Q.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P = The zinger was fraggled\n* Q = The zinger was smoogled\n\nSince both P and the consequent (Q) are true, we can logically conclude that Q is true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
