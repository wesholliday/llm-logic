(This is a conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** The glip was slogged. (This is a factual statement)\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'The glip was tragged', we need to see if the premises logically support the conclusion.  \n\nSince Premise 1 states that *if* the glip was slogged, *then* it was also tragged, and Premise 2 confirms that the glip *was* slogged, we can logically conclude that the glip must also have been tragged.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
