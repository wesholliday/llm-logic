(Conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** The flugel was blimmed. (Factual statement)\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'The flugel was zargled', we need to consider the structure of the conditional statement.  A conditional statement has the form \"If P, then Q\".  \n\n* P is the antecedent (the \"if\" part)\n* Q is the consequent (the \"then\" part)\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The flugel was blimmed\n* Q: The flugel was zargled\n\nSince we know P is true (Premise 2), and the conditional statement tells us that if P is true, then Q must also be true, we can logically conclude that Q is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
