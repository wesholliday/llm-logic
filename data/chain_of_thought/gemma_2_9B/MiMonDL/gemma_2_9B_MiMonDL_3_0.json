It doesn't rule out other possibilities.  \n\nThe new statement suggests the keys could be in the drawer *or* on the table. This is a broader possibility than the original statement.  \n\nSince the original statement doesn't exclude the possibility of the keys being on the table, we can infer that they *might* be in the drawer *or* on the table. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
