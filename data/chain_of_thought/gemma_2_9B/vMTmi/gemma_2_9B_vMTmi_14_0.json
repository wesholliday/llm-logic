This is a conditional statement (if P, then Q).\n\n* **Premise 2:** The wolf might not have been in the den. This statement weakens the certainty of the second part of the conditional statement in Premise 1.\n\n* **Conclusion:** The bear was not in the cave. This is the conclusion we are trying to determine if the premises logically support.\n\nNow, consider the possibilities:\n\n* **Scenario 1:** The bear was in the cave.  If this were true, Premise 1 would dictate that the wolf *must* have been in the den. However, Premise 2 tells us the wolf *might not* have been in the den. This creates a contradiction.\n\n* **Scenario 2:** The bear was not in the cave.  In this scenario, Premise 1 doesn't tell us anything about the wolf's location, so it doesn't create a contradiction.\n\nSince the first scenario leads to a contradiction, the argument's structure suggests that the only way to avoid contradiction is to accept the conclusion that the bear was not in the cave.\n\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
