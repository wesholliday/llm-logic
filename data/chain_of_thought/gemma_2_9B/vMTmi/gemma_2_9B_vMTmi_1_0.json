This is a conditional statement, meaning it asserts that if one event (Mary being at the wedding) happens, then another event (Sue being at the wedding) must also happen.\n\n* **Premise 2:** Sue might not have been at the wedding. This premise introduces the possibility that Sue was absent from the wedding.\n\n* **Conclusion:** Mary was not at the wedding. This is the claim the argument aims to prove.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion.  Premise 1 establishes a connection between Mary's presence and Sue's presence. However, Premise 2 only states that Sue *might* not have been there, it doesn't definitively say she wasn't.  \n\nThe argument attempts to use the possibility of Sue's absence to conclude that Mary must also be absent. This doesn't logically follow.  It's possible for Sue to be absent without Mary also being absent.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
