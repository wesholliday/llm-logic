It sets up a relationship where the truth of one statement (apple being red) guarantees the truth of another (banana being yellow).\n\n* **Premise 2:** \"The banana might not have been yellow.\" This premise introduces uncertainty about the color of the banana. It doesn't state definitively that the banana wasn't yellow, only that it's possible.\n\n* **Conclusion:** \"The apple was not red.\" This is the statement we want to determine if the argument supports.\n\nNow, let's consider the logic.  The argument attempts to use the conditional statement (Premise 1) to reach a conclusion about the apple's color. However, the second premise weakens the connection between the apple and the banana.  \n\nSince the banana *might* not have been yellow, we can't definitively say that the apple *must* not have been red.  The conditional statement only tells us what would happen *if* the apple *was* red. It doesn't tell us anything about the apple's color if the banana wasn't yellow.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
