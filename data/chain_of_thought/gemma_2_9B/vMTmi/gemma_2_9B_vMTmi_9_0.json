This is a conditional statement, meaning it asserts that one event (Lisa buying the red shirt) implies another event (Mark buying the blue shirt).\n\n* **Premise 2:** Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. This premise introduces uncertainty about Mark's action.\n\n* **Conclusion:** Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This is the claim we want to assess the validity of.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion.  Premise 1 establishes a connection between Lisa's action and Mark's action. Premise 2 suggests that Mark's action might not have occurred.  \n\nThe argument attempts to use this uncertainty about Mark's action to conclude something about Lisa's action.  However, the structure doesn't directly support this leap.  Just because Mark might not have bought the blue shirt doesn't automatically mean Lisa didn't buy the red shirt.\n\nThink of it this way: Premise 1 says that IF Lisa bought the red shirt, THEN Mark would have bought the blue shirt. It doesn't say anything about what happens if Mark *doesn't* buy the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
