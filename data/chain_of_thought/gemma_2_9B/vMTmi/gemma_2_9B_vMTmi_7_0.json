This is a conditional statement, meaning it asserts that if one event (Alex finishing) happens, then another event (Chris finishing) must also happen.\n\n* **Premise 2:** Chris might not have finished the race. This premise introduces the possibility that Chris did not finish.\n\n* **Conclusion:** Alex did not finish the race. This is the claim we want to assess.\n\nNow, consider the logical relationships between the premises and the conclusion.  Premise 1 states that if Alex finished, Chris *must* finish. However, Premise 2 only says that Chris *might* not have finished. It doesn't directly say anything about Alex.\n\nThe argument's structure doesn't guarantee that if Chris might not have finished, then Alex must not have finished.  It's possible for Alex to have finished the race even if Chris didn't.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
