It sets up a relationship where the truth of the first part (doll being plastic) guarantees the truth of the second part (truck being metal).\n\n* **Premise 2:** \"The truck might not have been metal.\" This premise introduces uncertainty about the state of the truck. It doesn't say the truck definitely wasn't metal, just that it's possible.\n\n* **Conclusion:** \"The doll was not plastic.\" This is the claim we want to see if the premises support.\n\nNow, let's think about the logic.  Premise 1 tells us that IF the doll was plastic, THEN the truck had to be metal.  Premise 2 tells us the truck MIGHT NOT have been metal.  \n\nDoes the possibility of the truck NOT being metal automatically mean the doll couldn't have been plastic?  Not necessarily.  \n\nHere's why:\n\n*  The argument doesn't rule out the possibility that the doll was NOT plastic in the first place.  \n\n*  The conclusion is trying to make a negative claim about the doll, but the premises only give us information about the truck.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid. The conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premises.\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
