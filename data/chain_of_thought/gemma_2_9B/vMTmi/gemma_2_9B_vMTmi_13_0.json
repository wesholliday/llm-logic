It sets up a relationship where the truth of the first part (car being red) guarantees the truth of the second part (truck being blue).\n\n* **Premise 2:** \"The truck might not have been blue.\" This premise introduces uncertainty about the color of the truck. It doesn't say the truck definitely wasn't blue, just that it's possible.\n\n* **Conclusion:** \"The car was not red.\" This is the claim we want to see if the premises support.\n\nNow, let's think about the logic.  Premise 1 tells us that IF the car was red, THEN the truck would have to be blue.  Premise 2 says the truck might not be blue.  Does that mean the car couldn't have been red?  Not necessarily.  \n\nThe truck not being blue doesn't automatically disprove the car being red.  There could be other scenarios where the car is red and the truck is a different color.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
