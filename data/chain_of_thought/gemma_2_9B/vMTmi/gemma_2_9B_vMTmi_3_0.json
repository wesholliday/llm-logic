This is a conditional statement, often written as \"If P, then Q\". Here, P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book must be a mystery novel\".\n\n* **Premise 2:** The book might not be a mystery novel. This statement suggests the possibility that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\n* **Conclusion:** The book was not written by James. This is the statement we want to determine if the argument supports.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion.  Premise 1 establishes a connection between James being the author and the book being a mystery novel. Premise 2 weakens the connection by suggesting the book might not be a mystery novel.  \n\nThe argument's structure resembles a form of *modus tollens*, a valid argument form. Modus tollens states:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nHowever, Premise 2 doesn't definitively state \"the book is not a mystery novel,\" only that \"it might not be.\" This weakens the argument's validity.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
