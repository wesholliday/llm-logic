If P, then Q (Conditional statement)\n2. P (Affirmation of the antecedent)\n\nThen we can logically conclude:\n\nQ (Conclusion)\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The griffin was in the forest\n* Q: The unicorn was in the forest\n\nWe are given:\n\n1. If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest (If P, then Q)\n2.
