If P, then Q (where P and Q are propositions)\n2. P\n\nThen we can logically conclude Q.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: Mary was at the wedding\n* Q: Sue was at the wedding\n\nWe are given:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (If P, then Q)\n2. Sue was at the wedding (P)\n\nTherefore, we can apply Modus Ponens and conclude that Mary was at the wedding (Q).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
