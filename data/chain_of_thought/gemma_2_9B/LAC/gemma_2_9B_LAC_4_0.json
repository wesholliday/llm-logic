A conditional statement has the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is the hypothesis (the \"if\" part) and Q is the conclusion (the \"then\" part).\n\n* **The Flaw:**  Affirming the consequent occurs when we assume that because the conclusion (Q) is true, the hypothesis (P) must also be true.  \n\n* **Applying it to the Example:**\n    * P: The alien visited Mars\n    * Q: The robot visited Jupiter\n\n    * We are given: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" (P -> Q)\n    * We are also given: \"The robot visited Jupiter\" (Q)\n\n    * **The Flaw:**  Just because the robot visited Jupiter (Q) doesn't automatically mean the alien visited Mars (P). There could be other reasons why the robot visited Jupiter.\n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine a scenario where the robot was sent to Jupiter for a completely different mission, unrelated to any alien activity on Mars.\n\n\nAnswer: \nno",
