It says that *if* a certain condition (the apple being red) is true, *then* another condition (the banana being yellow) must also be true.\n\n* **The Flaw:**  Affirming the consequent means assuming that because the consequent (the banana being yellow) is true, the antecedent (the apple being red) must also be true.  This is not necessarily the case.\n\n* **Counterexamples:**  There could be other reasons why the banana is yellow.  Maybe it's a different type of banana, or maybe it was dyed. The fact that the banana is yellow doesn't automatically tell us anything about the color of the apple.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
