We're dealing with a conditional statement (\"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\") and a factual statement (\"The book is a mystery novel\").  We want to know if we can definitively conclude that the book was written by James.\n\nLet's break down the logic:\n\n* **Conditional Statement:**  The first statement sets up a rule: If a certain condition (the book being written by James) is true, then a certain consequence (the book being a mystery novel) must also be true.\n\n* **Factual Statement:** The second statement tells us that the consequence (the book being a mystery novel) is indeed true.\n\n* **Deduction:**  Deduction works by starting with general rules (premises) and applying them to specific cases to reach a specific conclusion.  \n\nIn this case, we have a rule (the conditional statement) and a confirmation of the consequence.  However,  it's important to note that the conditional statement doesn't guarantee that the condition *must* be true if the consequence is true. There could be other reasons why the book is a mystery novel.\n\n**Example:**\n\nThink of it like this: \"If it's raining, the ground is wet.\"  If the ground is wet, we know it *could* be raining, but it could also be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, a burst pipe, etc.).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the factual statement supports the possibility that James wrote the book, we cannot definitively conclude that he *did* write it based solely on the given information.\n\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
