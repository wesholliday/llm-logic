(This is a conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** Chris finished the race. (This is a factual statement)\n\nModus Ponens states that if we have a conditional statement and the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is true, we can conclude that the consequent (the \"then\" part) is also true.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* The antecedent is \"Alex finished the race\".\n* The consequent is \"Chris finished the race\".\n\nWe are given that the consequent (Chris finished the race) is true.  Therefore, we can logically conclude that the antecedent (Alex finished the race) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
