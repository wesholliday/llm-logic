A conditional statement has the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is the hypothesis (the \"if\" part) and Q is the conclusion (the \"then\" part).\n\n* **Our Statements:**\n    *  P: The cake was chocolate.\n    *  Q: The muffins were blueberry.\n\n* **The Flaw:**  Affirming the consequent means assuming that because the conclusion (Q) is true, the hypothesis (P) must also be true.  This is not always the case.\n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine a scenario where the muffins were blueberry for a completely different reason \u2013 maybe they were always blueberry, regardless of the cake flavor.\n\n**Answer:** \nno \n\n\n",
