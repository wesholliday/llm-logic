There could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo, even if Joe didn't go to the park.\n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine a different scenario:\n\n* If it rained, then the ground is wet.\n* The ground is wet.\n\nCan we conclude that it rained?  No! The ground could be wet for other reasons (like someone spilled water).\n\nAnswer: no \n",
