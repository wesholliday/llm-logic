If P, then Q (conditional statement)\n2. P (affirmation of the antecedent)\n\nThen we can logically conclude:\n\nQ (affirmation of the consequent)\n\nLet's break down our example:\n\n* **P:** The bear was in the cave.\n* **Q:** The wolf was in the den.\n\n* **Premise 1:** If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. (If P, then Q)\n* **Premise 2:** The wolf was in the den. (P)\n\nSince we have both premises, we can apply Modus Ponens to conclude:\n\n**Answer:** yes \n\n\n",
