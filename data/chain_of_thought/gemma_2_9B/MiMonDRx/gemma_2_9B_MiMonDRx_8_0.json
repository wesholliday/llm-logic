The new statement expands the possibilities by saying the quank *might* be wozzle *or* quorple.  \n\nSince the original statement already includes the possibility of the quank being quorple, adding the possibility of it being wozzle doesn't change the original meaning. It simply adds another option.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n\n\n",
