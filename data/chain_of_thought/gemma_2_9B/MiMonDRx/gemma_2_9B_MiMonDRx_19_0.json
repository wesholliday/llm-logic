It doesn't, however, exclude the possibility of the flonk being something else, such as frazzle.  \n\nThe word \"might\" suggests uncertainty and leaves open the possibility of other options.  \n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively say that the flonk *must* be either frazzle or grazzle.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
