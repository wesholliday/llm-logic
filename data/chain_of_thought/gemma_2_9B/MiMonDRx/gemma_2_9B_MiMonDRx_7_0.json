This means there's a possibility, but not a certainty, that the glorp is zizz.  \n\nThe new statement asks if we can infer that the glorp *might* be plonk *or* zizz.  \n\nSince the original statement only focuses on the possibility of the glorp being zizz, we can't definitively say it *might* also be plonk. There's no information given to support that possibility.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
