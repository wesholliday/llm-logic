The new statement asks if we can infer \"The wobble might be shimble or snorkel\".  \n\nTo determine this, we need to consider if the original statement provides enough information to support the idea that the wobble *could also* be caused by a shimble.  \n\nThe original statement doesn't say anything about shimbles. It only focuses on snorkels.  Therefore, we can't logically conclude that the wobble might be caused by a shimble based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
