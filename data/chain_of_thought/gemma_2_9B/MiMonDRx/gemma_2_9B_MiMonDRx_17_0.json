This means there's a possibility it could be flim frazzle, but it could also be something else.  The new statement says the zazzle *might* be quank snizzle *or* flim frazzle. This expands the possibilities, including quank snizzle as a potential option.  \n\nSince the original statement already allows for the possibility of the zazzle being something other than flim frazzle, adding quank snizzle as another possibility doesn't change the overall meaning. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
