The new statement asks if we can infer that the blimple *might* be froodle *or* wibble.  \n\nSince the original statement only focuses on the possibility of the blimple being wibble, we can't definitively say it *might* also be froodle. There's no information given to support that possibility. \n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
