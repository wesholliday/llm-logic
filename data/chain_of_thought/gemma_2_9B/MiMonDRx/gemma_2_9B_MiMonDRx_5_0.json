The new statement asks if we can infer that the quimble *might* be blurble *or* quank.  \n\nSince the original statement only focuses on the possibility of the quimble being quank, we can't definitively say it *might* also be blurble. There's no information given to support that possibility. \n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
