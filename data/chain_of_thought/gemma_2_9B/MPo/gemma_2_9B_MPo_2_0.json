Premise 2 tells us that the presence of the griffin *implies* the presence of the unicorn in the forest.\n\nSince Premise 1 states that the griffin *was* in the forest, we can use the logic of the conditional statement to conclude that the unicorn must also have been in the forest.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
