Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know that P is true, we can conclude that Q is also true.\n\n1. **Identify the conditional statement:** \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This can be written symbolically as P -> Q, where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal.\"\n\n2. **Identify the given information:** We are given that \"the doll was plastic.\" This means P is true.\n\n3. **Apply modus ponens:** Since we have a true P and a conditional statement P -> Q, we can conclude that Q must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the truck was metal.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
