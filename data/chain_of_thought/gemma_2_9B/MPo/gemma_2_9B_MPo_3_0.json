Conditional statements have the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is the hypothesis and Q is the conclusion.\n\n* **Analyzing Premise 1:** It tells us that James is the author of the book.\n* **Analyzing Premise 2:** It states that *if* the book was written by James, *then* it must be a mystery novel.\n\nSince Premise 1 confirms the hypothesis (P) of Premise 2, we can logically conclude the conclusion (Q) of Premise 2.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
