Modus Ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, then we can conclude that the consequent (Q) is also true.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The bear was in the cave.\n* Q: The wolf was in the den.\n\nWe are given:\n\n* P is true (The bear was in the cave).\n* If P, then Q (If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den).\n\nTherefore, according to Modus Ponens, we can conclude that Q is also true.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
