Here's why:\n\n1. **Conditional Statement:** The second statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is a conditional statement. It tells us something about what happens *if* a certain condition (Tom watching football) is met.\n\n2. **Not Guaranteed:**  Just because the condition (Tom watching football) might be true, it doesn't automatically mean the consequence (Jen watching basketball) is also true. There could be other factors at play.\n\n3. **Missing Information:** We only know that Tom watched football. We don't know if the conditional statement is always true or if there are exceptions.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
