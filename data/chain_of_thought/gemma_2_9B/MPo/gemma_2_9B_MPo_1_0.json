Modus Ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, then we can conclude that the consequent (Q) is also true.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: Mary was at the wedding\n* Q: Sue was at the wedding\n\nWe are given:\n\n* P is true (Mary was at the wedding)\n* If P, then Q (If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding)\n\nTherefore, according to Modus Ponens, we can conclude that Q is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
