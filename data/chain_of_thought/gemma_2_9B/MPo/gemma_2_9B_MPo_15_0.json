The conditional statement tells us that if the first statement (Sam took a plane) is true, then the second statement (Erin took a train) must also be true.\n\nSince the first statement is true, according to the rules of logic, the conclusion of the conditional statement must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
