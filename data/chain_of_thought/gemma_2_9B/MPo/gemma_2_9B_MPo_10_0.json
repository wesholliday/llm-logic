Modus Ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, then we can conclude that the consequent (Q) is also true.\n\n1. **Identify the conditional statement:** \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This can be represented as P -> Q, where P is \"the dog was inside\" and Q is \"the cat was outside.\"\n\n2. **Identify the antecedent:** The first statement, \"The dog was inside,\" confirms that P is true.\n\n3. **Apply Modus Ponens:** Since we have a true antecedent (P) and a conditional statement (P -> Q), we can conclude that the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The cat was outside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
