Premise 2 tells us that Bob choosing pasta is dependent on Sue choosing pizza.  \n\nSince Premise 1 states that Sue *did* choose pizza, we can apply the rule of syllogism.  A syllogism is a type of logical argument that applies deductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion based on two or more propositions (premises).\n\nIn this case, our premises lead us to the conclusion that Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
