Premise 2 tells us that the truth of the first part (the car being red) guarantees the truth of the second part (the truck being blue).\n\nSince Premise 1 states that the car *was* red, we can apply the conditional statement in Premise 2.  Therefore, we can conclude that the truck *was* blue.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
