Premise 2 tells us that the color of the banana depends on the color of the apple.  \n\nSince Premise 1 states that the apple *was* red, we can apply the conditional statement in Premise 2.  This means that because the apple was red, the banana *must* have been yellow according to the rule set up in Premise 2.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
