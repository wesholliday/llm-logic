Premise 2 tells us that buying a red shirt by Lisa is a *sufficient condition* for Mark buying a blue shirt.  \n\nSince Premise 1 states that Lisa *did* buy the red shirt, we can apply the rule of modus ponens. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (if P, then Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: Lisa bought the red shirt\n* Q: Mark bought the blue shirt\n\nPremise 1 confirms P is true. Therefore, according to modus ponens, we can conclude that Q must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
