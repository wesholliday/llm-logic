The original statement is:\n\n* If P, then Q (where P = \"the klonk is fizzered\" and Q = \"the meeping will nurple\").\n\nThe new statement is:\n\n* If P and R, then Q (where P = \"the klonk is fizzered\" and Q = \"the meeping will nurple\" and R = \"the splat dangles\").\n\nThe key here is to see if the original statement provides enough information to guarantee the truth of the new statement.  \n\nSince the original statement only tells us what happens *if* the klonk is fizzered, it doesn't say anything about what happens when the splat dangles.  The splat dangling could be completely unrelated to the meeping nurpling.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
