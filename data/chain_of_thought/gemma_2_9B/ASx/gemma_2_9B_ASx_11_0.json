The original statement only tells us what happens *if* the zibble is zapped. It doesn't say anything about what happens when the quib is squinked, or what happens when *both* the zibble is zapped *and* the quib is squinked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
