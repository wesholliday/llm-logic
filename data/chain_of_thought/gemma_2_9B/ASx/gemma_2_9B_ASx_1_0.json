This can be represented symbolically as P -> Q, where P is \"the snark was blimmed\" and Q is \"it flooped.\"\n\nNow let's look at the new statement we want to infer:\n\n* **New Statement:** If the snark was blimmed and sproinged, then it flooped. This can be represented as (P and R) -> Q, where R is \"the snark was sproinged.\"\n\nThe key here is to see if the original premise logically guarantees the truth of the new statement.  The original premise only tells us something about what happens *if* the snark is blimmed. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the snark is also sproinged.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the original premise.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
