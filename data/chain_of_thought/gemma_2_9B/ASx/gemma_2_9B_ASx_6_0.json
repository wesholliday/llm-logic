The original statement says that \"If you glurp, it will hurt my snarfs.\" This implies a direct causal relationship between the action of \"glurping\" and the consequence of hurting the speaker's \"snarfs.\"\n\nThe new statement adds the condition \"and I am wearing plorks.\"  We don't know anything about \"plorks\" or their relationship to \"glurping\" or \"snarfs.\"  \n\nSince the new statement introduces a new element (\"plorks\") without any information about its relevance to the original causal relationship, we cannot infer that the new statement is true. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
