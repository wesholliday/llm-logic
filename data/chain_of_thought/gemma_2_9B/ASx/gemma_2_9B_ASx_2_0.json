The second statement introduces a new event (a wug ziting).  \n\nWe don't have any information about whether the wug ziting is related to the crinkling of the snoogle or the plopping of the nurp.  \n\nSince the second statement introduces a new, unrelated event, we cannot logically infer it from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
