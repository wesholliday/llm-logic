This means there's a possibility, but not a certainty, that the snork is zazzle.  \n\nThe new statement asks if we can infer that the snork *might* be zazzle *or* quazzle.  Since the original statement only mentions zazzle, we can't be sure if the snork could also be quazzle.  There's no information given to support that possibility.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
