The new statement wants to know if the zibble *might* be a blimp *or* a frozz.  We don't have any information about frozz in the original statement.  \n\nSince the original statement only talks about the possibility of the zibble being a blimp, we can't conclude anything about it being a frozz. \n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
