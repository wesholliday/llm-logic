This means there's a possibility, but not a certainty, that the plimp is wobble.  \n\nThe new statement asks if we can infer that the plimp *might* be wobble *or* blimple.  \n\nSince the original statement only talks about the plimp possibly being wobble, we can't definitively say it *might* also be blimple. There's no information given to support that possibility.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
