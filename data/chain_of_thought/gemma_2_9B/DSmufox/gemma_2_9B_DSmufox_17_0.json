It could be something else.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled.\" This presents a disjunction - the flob must be either movated *or* skizzled. There are no other options.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship:\n\n* If the flob *must* be movated (which statement 1 denies), then statement 2 would force the conclusion that the flob is skizzled. \n* However, statement 1 tells us the flob doesn't *have* to be movated.  \n\nSince statement 2 only offers two possibilities and statement 1 rules out one, the only remaining possibility is that the flob must be skizzled.\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
