It means that one of two things must be true: either the dreb is spened, or it is vroombed.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n* If the dreb is spened, Statement 2 is satisfied.\n* If the dreb is not spened, Statement 2 requires that it must be vroombed.\n\nSince Statement 1 tells us the dreb does not have to be spened, the only way to satisfy Statement 2 is if the dreb is vroombed.\n\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
