It could be something else.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the wug must be bimmed or it is flooped.\" This presents a disjunction, meaning one of two things *must* be true: the wug is bimmed, or the wug is flooped.\n\nNow, we want to see if we can conclude that \"The wug is flooped.\"\n\nSince Statement 1 tells us the wug isn't *necessarily* bimmed, and Statement 2 says *something* must be true (bimmed or flooped), the only remaining option is that the wug must be flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes \n\n\n",
