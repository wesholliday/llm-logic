It could be something else.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the fribble must be crinked or it is snurgled.\" This presents a disjunction - the fribble must be either crinked *or* snurgled (or possibly both).\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship:\n\n* If the fribble *must* be crinked (as Statement 1 denies), then Statement 2 would be true.\n* Since Statement 1 says the fribble *doesn't have to* be crinked,  we can't assume it is crinked.\n\nTherefore, the only remaining option from Statement 2 is that the fribble *must* be snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
