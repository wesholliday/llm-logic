However, Statement 1 contradicts this, saying the fleeg doesn't have to be surned.\n\n* **Scenario 2:** If the fleeg is not surned, then Statement 1 is true.  Statement 2 then forces the fleeg to be bluttered since the 'or' part of the disjunction must be true.\n\nTherefore, the only scenario that satisfies both statements is if the fleeg is bluttered. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
