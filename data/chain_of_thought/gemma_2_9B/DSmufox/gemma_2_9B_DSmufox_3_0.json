This can be rewritten as \"The splat does not have to be quanked.\"\n\n* **Premise 2:** Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed. This is a disjunction, meaning one or the other (or both) must be true.\n\n**Now, let's analyze:**\n\n* If the splat doesn't have to be quanked (Premise 1), and the only other option is that it must be morphed (Premise 2), then the splat must be morphed. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
