This means one of two things must be true: either the shank is nugged, or the shank is plooked.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* If the shank were nugged, Statement 2 would be satisfied.\n* However, Statement 1 tells us the shank is *not necessarily* nugged.\n\nSince we can't definitively say the shank is nugged, the only remaining option to satisfy Statement 2 is that the shank must be plooked.\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
