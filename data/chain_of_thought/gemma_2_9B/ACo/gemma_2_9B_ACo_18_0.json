Here's why:\n\n1. **The first statement tells us the truck is metal.** This is a fact.\n\n2. **The second statement is a conditional statement.** It says *if* the doll was plastic, *then* the truck would be metal.  \n\n3. **We know the truck *is* metal, but that doesn't automatically mean the doll *must* be plastic.**  The conditional statement only tells us what would happen *if* the doll were plastic, not that it actually is plastic.\n\nThere could be other reasons why the truck is metal.  \n\n*Answer:* no \n",
