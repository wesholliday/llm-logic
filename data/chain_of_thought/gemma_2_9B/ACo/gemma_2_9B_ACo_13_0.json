Here's why:\n\n1. **Conditional Statement:** The second statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement. It tells us something about what happens *if* a certain condition (the car being red) is met.\n\n2. **Not a Guarantee:**  Conditional statements don't guarantee that the condition (the car being red) actually happened. They only tell us what would happen *if* it did.\n\n3. **Other Possibilities:**  We know the truck was blue, but there could be other reasons why the truck was blue besides the car being red.  \n\n*Answer:* no \n",
