It says that *if* the apple was red, *then* the banana would be yellow. This doesn't mean that because the banana is yellow, the apple *must* have been red.\n\n2. **Possible Other Explanations:** There could be other reasons why the banana was yellow besides the apple being red.  Maybe the banana ripened naturally, or perhaps it was a different variety of banana that is naturally yellow.\n\n3. **Logical Fallacy:**  Trying to infer the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of a conditional statement just because the consequent (the \"then\" part) is true is a logical fallacy called \"affirming the consequent\". \n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
