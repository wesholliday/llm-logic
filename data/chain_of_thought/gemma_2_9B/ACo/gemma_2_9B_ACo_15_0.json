Here's why:\n\n* **Conditional Statement:** The second statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is a conditional statement. It tells us that if a certain condition (Sam taking a plane) is met, then a consequence (Erin taking a train) will follow.\n\n* **Not a Guarantee:**  Conditional statements don't guarantee that the condition will be true. They only state a relationship between the condition and the consequence.\n\n* **Insufficient Information:** We know Erin took a train, but we don't know if Sam took a plane or not. The first statement only tells us about Erin's actions, and the second statement only tells us about a possible relationship between Sam's and Erin's actions.\n\n* **Other Possibilities:** There could be other reasons why Erin took a train, even if Sam didn't take a plane.\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
