It says that *if* Ben ate pasta, *then* Kate ate salad. This doesn't mean that because Kate ate salad, Ben *must* have eaten pasta. \n\n* **Other Possibilities:** There could be other reasons why Kate ate salad.  Maybe she had it for lunch, or it was part of a shared meal where Ben didn't eat pasta.\n\n* **Example:** Think of it like this: \"If it rains, the ground is wet.\"  Just because the ground is wet doesn't mean it *must* have rained. There could be other reasons for the ground to be wet (like someone watering their lawn).\n\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
