Here's why:\n\n1. **Conditional Statement:** The second statement is a conditional statement (\"If P, then Q\"). It tells us that *if* the alien visited Mars (P), *then* the robot visited Jupiter (Q). \n\n2. **Not Enough Information:**  We know the robot visited Jupiter, but this doesn't automatically mean the alien visited Mars.  There could be other reasons why the robot visited Jupiter.\n\n3. **Counterexamples:**  Imagine a scenario where the alien never visited Mars, but the robot visited Jupiter for some other reason (e.g., a mission sent by humans). This would satisfy the second statement without the alien ever going to Mars.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
