Modus Ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know that P is true, we can conclude that Q is also true.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The vampire was awake\n* Q: The mummy was awake\n\nWe are given:\n\n* Q: The mummy was awake (This is our premise)\n* If P, then Q: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (This is our conditional statement)\n\nSince we know Q is true and we have the conditional statement, we can apply Modus Ponens to conclude that P must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n\n\n",
