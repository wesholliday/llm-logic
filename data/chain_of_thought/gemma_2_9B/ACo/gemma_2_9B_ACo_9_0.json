Here's why:\n\n1. **The first statement tells us Mark bought the blue shirt.** This is a fact.\n\n2. **The second statement is a conditional statement.** It says *if* Lisa bought the red shirt, *then* Mark bought the blue shirt.  \n\n3. **Conditional statements don't automatically mean the \"if\" part is true.**  Just because Mark bought the blue shirt doesn't mean Lisa *must* have bought the red shirt. There could be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\n*Answer:* no \n",
