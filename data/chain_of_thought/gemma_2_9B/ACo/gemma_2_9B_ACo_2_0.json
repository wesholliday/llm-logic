Here's why:\n\n* **The first statement tells us the unicorn was in the forest.** This is a fact.\n* **The second statement is a conditional statement.** It says that *if* the griffin was in the forest, *then* the unicorn would also be in the forest.  \n\nHowever, the second statement doesn't say anything about whether the griffin actually *is* in the forest. It only sets up a relationship between the two creatures.\n\n**Think of it like this:**\n\nIf it's raining, then the ground is wet. We know the ground is wet, but that doesn't mean it *must* be raining. There could be other reasons the ground is wet (like someone spilled water).\n\nSimilarly, we know the unicorn is in the forest, but the griffin's presence isn't guaranteed.\n\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
