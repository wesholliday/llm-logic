The second statement presents a conditional relationship: if a certain condition (the shirt being cotton) is met, then a consequence follows (the pants being denim).\n\nNotice that the first statement doesn't tell us anything about the shirt.  The second statement only tells us what happens *if* the shirt is cotton, but it doesn't say anything about whether or not the shirt actually *is* cotton.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the shirt was cotton from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
