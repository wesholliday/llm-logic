Here's why:\n\n* **The first statement tells us Sue was present.** This is a fact.\n* **The second statement is a conditional statement.** It says *if* Mary was at the wedding, *then* Sue would have been there.  \n\nSince Sue *was* at the wedding, the second statement is satisfied. However, it doesn't tell us anything about whether Mary *actually* attended.  Mary could have been there, or she could have been absent.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
