Here's why:\n\n* **The first statement tells us Lucy went to the zoo.** This doesn't give us any information about Joe.\n* **The second statement is a conditional statement.** It says *if* Joe went to the park, *then* Lucy went to the zoo.  This means that if the first part of the statement (Joe going to the park) is true, the second part (Lucy going to the zoo) must also be true. However, it doesn't say anything about whether Joe actually *did* go to the park.\n\nSince we only know Lucy went to the zoo, and we don't have any information confirming Joe went to the park, we can't conclude that he did.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
