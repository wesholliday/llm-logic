Here's why:\n\n1. **Conditional Statement:** The second statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is a conditional statement. It tells us that if a certain condition (Sue choosing pizza) is met, then a consequence (Bob choosing pasta) will follow.\n\n2. **Not a Guarantee:**  Conditional statements don't guarantee that the condition will be true just because the consequence is true.  \n\n3. **Other Possibilities:**  There could be other reasons why Bob chose pasta besides Sue choosing pizza.  \n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that Sue chose pizza just because Bob chose pasta.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
