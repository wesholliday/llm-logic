It says that *if* the cake was chocolate, *then* the muffins were blueberry. This doesn't mean that the muffins being blueberry guarantees the cake was chocolate.\n\n2. **Possible Scenarios:**  There could be other reasons why the muffins were blueberry.  Maybe there's a general rule in this bakery that all muffins are blueberry, regardless of the cake flavor.\n\n3. **Insufficient Information:** We only have two pieces of information, and they don't provide enough to conclude that the cake was chocolate.\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
