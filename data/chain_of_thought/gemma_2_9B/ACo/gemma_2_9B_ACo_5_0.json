Here's why:\n\n1. **The first statement tells us Amy played tennis.** This is a fact.\n\n2. **The second statement is a conditional statement.** It says that *if* Jeff played basketball, *then* Amy played tennis.  \n\n3. **Conditional statements don't automatically mean the first part is true.**  Just because Amy played tennis doesn't mean Jeff *must* have played basketball. There could be other reasons why Amy played tennis.\n\n4. **Example:** Imagine Amy plays tennis every day, regardless of whether Jeff plays basketball or not. The second statement would still be true, but it wouldn't mean Jeff actually played basketball.\n\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
