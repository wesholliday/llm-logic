Here's why:\n\n* **The first statement tells us the wolf was in the den.** This is a fact.\n* **The second statement sets up a conditional relationship:** If the bear *was* in the cave, *then* the wolf *was* in the den.  \n\nNotice that the second statement doesn't say the bear *is* in the cave, only that *if* it were, the wolf would be in the den.  Since we know the wolf *is* in the den, this doesn't automatically mean the bear *must* be in the cave. There could be other reasons the wolf is in the den.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
