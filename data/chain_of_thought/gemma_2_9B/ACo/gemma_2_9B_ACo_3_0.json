If P, then Q.\n2. P\n\nThen we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nLet's apply this to our problem:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. (If P, then Q)\n* **Premise 2:** The book is a mystery novel. (P)\n\nSince we know the book is a mystery novel (P), and we know that if it was written by James, it would be a mystery novel (If P, then Q), we can conclude that the book was written by James (Q).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
