This means there's a possibility, but not a certainty, that the flimble is grooble.  \n\nThe new statement wants to know if we can say the flimble *might* be both wobble and grooble.  \n\nWe can't definitively say that. The original statement only tells us about the possibility of the flimble being grooble, it doesn't say anything about other possibilities, like wobble. \n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
