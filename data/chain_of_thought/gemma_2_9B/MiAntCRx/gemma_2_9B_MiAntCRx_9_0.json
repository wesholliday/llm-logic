The new statement says the flonk *might* be both quibble and frazzle.  \n\nTo determine if we can infer the new statement from the original, we need to consider if the original statement provides enough information to support the idea that the flonk could also be quibble.  \n\nThe original statement doesn't say anything about the flonk being quibble. It only focuses on the possibility of it being frazzle.  \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the flonk might be both quibble and frazzle from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
