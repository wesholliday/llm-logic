It doesn't explicitly state that both outcomes are possible simultaneously.  \n\nThe phrase \"might win or lose\" implies a disjunction, meaning one outcome will occur, but not necessarily both.  \n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The team might win the match and the team might lose the match\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
