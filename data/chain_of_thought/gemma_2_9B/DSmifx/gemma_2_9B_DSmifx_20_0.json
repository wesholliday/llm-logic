Statement 2 tells us it's possible the fleeg isn't surned, so this possibility is ruled out.\n\n* **Possibility 2:** The fleeg is bluttered. Statement 1 tells us this is a possibility if the fleeg isn't surned.\n\nSince the first possibility is ruled out, the only remaining possibility is that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
