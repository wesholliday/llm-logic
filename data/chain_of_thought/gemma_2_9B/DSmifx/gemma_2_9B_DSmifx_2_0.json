Statement 2 doesn't contradict this.\n* **Possibility 2:** The wug is not bimmed. If this is true, then according to Statement 1, it *must* be flooped.\n\nSince we know it's possible the wug isn't bimmed, and if it's not bimmed it *must* be flooped, we can infer that the wug is flooped. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
