            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nLet's break down the statements:\n\n* **Statement 1:** \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement. It means that if the first part (Tom watching football) is true, then the second part (Jen watching basketball) must also be true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Jen might not have watched basketball.\" This statement says that it's possible, but not certain, that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can conclude that Tom did *not* watch football.  \n\nThink about the structure of a conditional statement.  The key is that the first statement doesn't say anything about what happens if the first part is *false*. It only tells us what happens if it's true.\n\nSince we know Jen *might* not have watched basketball, it doesn't automatically mean Tom didn't watch football.  It's possible that Tom watched football and Jen still didn't watch basketball.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
