            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nLet's break down the statements:\n\n* **Statement 1:** \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This is a conditional statement. It means that if the first part (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Sue might not have been at the wedding.\" This statement says that it's possible Sue wasn't at the wedding. It doesn't definitively say she wasn't there.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n* We can't directly conclude that Mary wasn't at the wedding just because Sue might not have been.  The first statement only tells us what happens *if* Mary was there. It doesn't say anything about what happens if Mary wasn't there.\n\n*  It's possible that Mary wasn't at the wedding, and therefore the first statement's condition was never met. In this case, Sue not being there wouldn't violate the first statement.\n\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
