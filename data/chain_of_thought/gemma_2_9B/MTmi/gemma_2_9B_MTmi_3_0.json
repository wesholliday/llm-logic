            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nLet's break down the statements:\n\n* **Statement 1:** \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\" This is a conditional statement. It sets up a rule: if the antecedent (the book was written by James) is true, then the consequent (the book must be a mystery novel) is also true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The book might not be a mystery novel.\" This statement tells us that the book's genre is uncertain. It doesn't definitively say it's not a mystery novel, just that it's possible.\n\nNow, to determine if we can infer \"The book was not written by James,\" we need to consider the logical relationship between these statements.  We can use a technique called \"modus tollens\" to help us. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states:\n\nIf we have:\n* A conditional statement (If P, then Q)\n* And the negation of the consequent (not Q)\n\nThen we can infer the negation of the antecedent (not P).\n\nLet's apply this to our statements:\n\n* **P:** The book was written by James\n* **Q:** The book must be a mystery novel\n\n* **Statement 1:** If P, then Q\n* **Statement 2:** Not Q (The book might not be a mystery novel)\n\nAccording to modus tollens, we can infer **not P**, which means **the book was not written by James**.\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
