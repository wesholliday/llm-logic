            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nLet's break down the statements:\n\n* **Statement 1:** \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" This is a conditional statement. It sets up a cause-and-effect relationship: if the first part (apple red) is true, then the second part (banana yellow) must also be true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The banana might not have been yellow.\" This statement introduces uncertainty about the color of the banana. It doesn't say the banana definitely wasn't yellow, just that it's possible.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n* If the apple *was* red, then according to Statement 1, the banana *must* have been yellow.  But Statement 2 tells us the banana *might not* have been yellow. This creates a contradiction.\n\n* Therefore, the only way to resolve this contradiction is if the first part of the conditional statement (the apple being red) is false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n\n\n",
