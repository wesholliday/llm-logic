It tells us that eating pasta is a *sufficient* condition for Kate eating salad.\n\n* **Premise 2:** Kate might not have eaten salad. This means it's possible, but not certain, that Kate did not eat salad.\n\n* **Conclusion:** We want to know if we can infer that Ben did *not* eat pasta.\n\nNow, let's analyze:\n\nThe first premise doesn't directly tell us anything about whether Ben *did* eat pasta. It only states what would happen *if* he did.  The second premise weakens the connection between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating salad.  Since Kate might not have eaten salad, it doesn't automatically mean Ben didn't eat pasta.\n\n**Answer:** \nno \n\n\n",
