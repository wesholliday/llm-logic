            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nLet's break down the statements:\n\n* **Statement 1:** \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the first part (the doll being plastic) is true, then the second part (the truck being metal) must also be true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The truck might not have been metal.\" This statement weakens the certainty of the truck being metal. It leaves open the possibility that the truck could be made of a different material.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Can we infer 'The doll was not plastic'?\"\n\nTo answer this, we need to think about the logical relationship between the statements.  If the truck wasn't metal (as statement 2 suggests), then the conditional statement (statement 1) wouldn't necessarily hold true.  The doll could still have been plastic, even if the truck wasn't metal.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the doll was not plastic based on the given information. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
