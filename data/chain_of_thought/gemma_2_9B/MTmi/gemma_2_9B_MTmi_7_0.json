It means that if the first part (Alex finishing) is true, then the second part (Chris finishing) must also be true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Chris might not have finished the race.\" This statement says that it's possible Chris did not finish. It doesn't definitively say he didn't.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can conclude that Alex did *not* finish the race.  \n\nThink about the structure of the conditional statement.  It only guarantees that if Alex *did* finish, then Chris *must* have finished. It doesn't say anything about what happens if Alex *didn't* finish.\n\nSince we know Chris *might* not have finished, and the first statement doesn't rule out the possibility of Alex not finishing, we can't definitively say Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
