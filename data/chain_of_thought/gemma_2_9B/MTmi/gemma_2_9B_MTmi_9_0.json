            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nLet's break down the statements:\n\n* **Statement 1:** \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement. It means that if the first part (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the second part (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\" This statement introduces uncertainty about Mark buying the blue shirt. It doesn't say he definitely didn't buy it, just that it's possible.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n* If Lisa *did* buy the red shirt, then according to Statement 1, Mark *must* have bought the blue shirt.\n* However, Statement 2 tells us that Mark *might not* have bought the blue shirt.\n\nThese two statements create a contradiction.  If Lisa bought the red shirt, it would mean Mark *must* have bought the blue shirt, but we're also told Mark *might not* have bought the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, the only way to resolve this contradiction is if Lisa did *not* buy the red shirt. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
