It implies that if the first part (cake was chocolate) is true, then the second part (muffins were blueberry) must also be true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The muffins might not have been blueberry.\" This statement weakens the certainty of the second part of the conditional statement. It suggests that there's a possibility the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that the cake was not chocolate.  \n\nSince the second statement casts doubt on the truth of the second part of the conditional statement, it doesn't directly tell us anything about the truth of the first part (the cake being chocolate).  We can't definitively say the cake was not chocolate just because the muffins might not have been blueberry.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
