This is a conditional statement.\n* **Premise 2:** The truck might not have been blue. This means the truck could have been a different color.\n\n* **Conclusion:** We want to know if we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nNow, let's analyze:\n\nPremise 1 tells us that *if* the car was red, *then* the truck would have to be blue.  Premise 2 tells us the truck wasn't necessarily blue.  \n\nSince the truck's color is not definitively blue, we can't say for sure whether the car was red or not. The first premise only tells us what would happen *if* the car was red, it doesn't say anything about the car's actual color.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
