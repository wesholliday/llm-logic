This is a conditional statement.\n* **Premise 2:** The pants might not have been denim. This means there's a possibility the pants were not denim.\n\n* **What we want to find:** Can we conclude that the shirt was not cotton?\n\nLet's analyze:\n\nPremise 1 tells us that cotton shirt *implies* denim pants.  It doesn't say anything about what happens if the pants are *not* denim.  Premise 2 simply states a possibility about the pants, not a certainty.\n\nSince the pants not being denim doesn't automatically mean the shirt wasn't cotton, we can't definitively conclude that.  There could be other reasons why the pants weren't denim.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
