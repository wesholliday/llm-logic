It leaves open the possibility that the toy *could* be on the bookshelf.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box.\" This statement presents a disjunction, meaning one of the two options *must* be true.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n* If the toy *is* on the bookshelf, Statement 1 doesn't contradict Statement 2.\n* If the toy *is not* on the bookshelf, then Statement 2 forces us to conclude that it *must* be in the toy box.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
