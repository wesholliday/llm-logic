It leaves open the possibility that the cat *is* playing in the bedroom.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the cat is playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch.\" This statement presents two mutually exclusive options: the cat is either playing in the bedroom or napping on the couch.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n* If the cat *is* playing in the bedroom, Statement 2 is true.\n* If the cat *is not* playing in the bedroom, then Statement 2 must be true because the only other option is napping on the couch.\n\nSince Statement 1 doesn't rule out the cat playing in the bedroom, we can't definitively say the cat is napping on the couch. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
