It leaves open the possibility that the book *is* resting on the table.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf.\" This statement presents a disjunction, meaning one of the options *must* be true.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities:\n\n* If the book is on the table, Statement 1 doesn't contradict Statement 2.\n* If the book is on the shelf, Statement 1 doesn't contradict Statement 2.\n\nSince Statement 1 doesn't rule out either possibility, and Statement 2 requires one of the possibilities to be true, we can't definitively conclude that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
