It leaves open the possibility that Fido *could* be in the garden.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside.\"** This statement presents a disjunction. It means that one of two things *must* be true: Fido is in the garden, or Fido is inside.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n* If Fido were in the garden, Statement 2 would be satisfied.\n* If Fido were inside, Statement 2 would also be satisfied.\n\nSince Statement 1 doesn't rule out either possibility, and Statement 2 guarantees that one of the possibilities *must* be true, we can't definitively conclude that Fido is inside. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
