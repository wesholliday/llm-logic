However, Statement 2 tells us the sock *must* be in one of the two locations: under the bed or in the laundry basket.\n\nSince Statement 1 doesn't rule out the laundry basket as a possibility, and Statement 2 says the sock *must* be in one of those two places, we can conclude that the missing sock must be in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
