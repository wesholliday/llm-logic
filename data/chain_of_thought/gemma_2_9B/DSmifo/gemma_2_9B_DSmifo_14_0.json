It doesn't definitively say it's not there.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter\" - This statement presents a disjunction (or). It says the milk is *either* in the fridge *or* on the counter. There are no other options.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship:\n\n* Statement 1 leaves open the possibility that the milk is in the fridge.\n* Statement 2 eliminates all other possibilities besides the fridge or the counter.\n\nSince Statement 1 doesn't rule out the fridge, and Statement 2 only allows for those two options, we can conclude that the milk must be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes \n\n\n",
