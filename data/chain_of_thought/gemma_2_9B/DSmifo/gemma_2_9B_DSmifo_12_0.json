It leaves open the possibility that the jacket *is* in the closet.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the jacket must be hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair\" - This statement presents two mutually exclusive options: the jacket is in the closet, or it is on the chair.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n* If we assume the jacket *is* in the closet, Statement 1 wouldn't be a problem. \n* However, if the jacket is *not* in the closet, then Statement 2 forces us to conclude that it must be on the chair.\n\nSince Statement 1 doesn't rule out the jacket being in the closet, we can't definitively say that it *must* be on the chair.\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
