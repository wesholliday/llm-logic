It doesn't definitively say it's *not* on the desk, just that it's possible it's not.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag.\" This is a disjunction, meaning one of these two options *must* be true.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities:\n\n* If the pen *is* on my desk, Statement 2 is satisfied.\n* If the pen *is not* on my desk, then Statement 2 forces it to be in my bag.\n\nSince Statement 1 doesn't rule out the pen being on the desk, we can't definitively say it's in the bag. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
