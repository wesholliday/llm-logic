This means the test-taking must be happening within the context of being at school.\n\nSince the statements only say the child *might* be at school and *might* be taking a test, they don't definitively link the two. It's possible the child is taking a test at home, or somewhere else entirely.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
