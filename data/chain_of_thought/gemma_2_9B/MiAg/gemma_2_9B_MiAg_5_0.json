This means there's a possibility the car is in the garage, but it's not certain.\n* **Statement 2:** The car might be red. This means there's a possibility the car is red, but it's not certain.\n\nThe conclusion states: The car might be a red car in the garage. This combines both possibilities.  \n\nSince both original statements allow for the possibility of the car being in the garage *and* red, it logically follows that the car *might* be a red car in the garage.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
