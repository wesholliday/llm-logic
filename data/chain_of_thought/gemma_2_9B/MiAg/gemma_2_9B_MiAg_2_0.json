This leaves open the possibility that they are elsewhere.\n* The second statement says the keys *might* be on a keychain. This also leaves open the possibility that they are not on a keychain.\n\nThe third statement combines both possibilities, saying the keys *might* be in the drawer *and* on a keychain.  \n\nSince the original statements don't rule out the possibility of the keys being in the drawer *and* on a keychain, we can't definitively say they are. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
