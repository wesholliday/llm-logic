The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then reversing the order. \n\nLet's break down the original statement:\n\n* **Hypothesis:** The splat was morphed.\n* **Conclusion:** The splat quanked.\n\nNow, let's form the contrapositive:\n\n* **Negated Hypothesis:** The splat was not morphed.\n* **Negated Conclusion:** The splat did not quank.\n\n* **Reversed Order:** If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed.\n\nNotice that the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n\n\n",
