The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order. \n\nLet's break down the original statement:\n\n* **Hypothesis:** The clug was fleeked.\n* **Conclusion:** The clug snugged.\n\nNow, let's form the contrapositive:\n\n* **Negated Hypothesis:** The clug was not fleeked.\n* **Negated Conclusion:** The clug was not snugged.\n\n* **Contrapositive:** If the clug was not fleeked, then the clug was not snugged.\n\nThe original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
