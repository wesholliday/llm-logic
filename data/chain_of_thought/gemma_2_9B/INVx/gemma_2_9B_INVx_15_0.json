The original statement says that if P is true, then Q must also be true. The inverse statement says that if P is false, then Q must also be false.  These are different conditions.\n\nConsider a counterexample:\n\n* Imagine a scenario where the dreb was neither vroombed nor spened.  \n\nIn this case, the original statement is not violated because the antecedent (P) is not true. However, the inverse statement would be violated because it claims that if P is false, then Q must also be false.\n\n**Answer:** \nno",
