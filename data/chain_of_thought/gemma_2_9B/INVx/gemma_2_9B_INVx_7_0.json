The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order. \n\nLet's break down the original statement:\n\n* **Hypothesis:** The whiffle was shanked.\n* **Conclusion:** The whiffle tinked.\n\nNow, let's negate both:\n\n* **Negated Hypothesis:** The whiffle was not shanked.\n* **Negated Conclusion:** The whiffle did not tink.\n\nFinally, we reverse the order:\n\n* **Contrapositive:** If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nThis shows that the contrapositive of the original statement is logically equivalent to it.  Therefore, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n\n\n",
