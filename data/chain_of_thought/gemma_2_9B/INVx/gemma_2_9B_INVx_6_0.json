The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then reversing the order. \n\n1. **Original statement:** If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\n2. **Negate hypothesis and conclusion:** If the grommet was *not* sploffed, then the grommet *did not* plop the frink.\n\n3. **Reverse the order:** If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of the original statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.  \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
