The original statement says that if P is true, then Q must also be true. The inverse statement says that if P is false, then Q must also be false.  These are not always the same.\n\nConsider a counterexample:\n\n* Imagine P is \"It is raining\" and Q is \"The ground is wet.\"\n\n* The original statement \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\" is generally true.\n\n* However, the inverse \"If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet\" is not always true. The ground could be wet from other sources like a sprinkler.\n\n**Therefore, we cannot infer the inverse statement from the original statement.**\n\nAnswer: no \n",
