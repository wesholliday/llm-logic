The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order. \n\nLet's break down the original statement:\n\n* **Hypothesis:** The wug was sproinged.\n* **Conclusion:** It was garpled.\n\nNow, let's form the contrapositive:\n\n* **Negated Hypothesis:** The wug was not sproinged.\n* **Negated Conclusion:** It was not garpled.\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" is \"If the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled.\"\n\nIn logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
