The original statement tells us something about what happens when P is true. The inverse tells us something about what happens when P is false.  \n\n* **Counterexample:**  Consider a scenario where the sprocket is never daggled, regardless of whether it's cranked or not. In this case, the original statement would be true (since it's never cranked *and* never daggled), but the inverse would be false (because it's not cranked, but it's not daggled either).\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
