            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nThis question asks about the logical relationship between two statements. The first statement is a conditional statement, meaning it proposes a cause-and-effect relationship.  \n\nLet's break down the original statement:\n\n* **If the twonk was plinked (hypothesis):** This is the condition that needs to be met.\n* **Then it was varnished (conclusion):** This is the outcome that follows if the hypothesis is true.\n\nTo determine if the second statement is a valid inference, we need to consider the logical structure of conditional statements and their negations.\n\n**Understanding Negations:**\n\n* **Negating the hypothesis:** \"The twonk was not plinked\" means the condition in the original statement did not occur.\n* **Negating the conclusion:** \"It was not varnished\" means the outcome in the original statement did not occur.\n\n**Logical Relationship:**\n\nThe original statement asserts that if the twonk *was* plinked, then it *was* varnished.  The second statement proposes the opposite: if the twonk *was not* plinked, then it *was not* varnished.\n\nThese statements are actually **logically equivalent**.  They represent the two sides of the same coin. If one is true, the other must also be true.\n\nAnswer: \nyes",
