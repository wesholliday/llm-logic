This can be represented symbolically as P \u2192 Q (where P = \"the shank was plooked\" and Q = \"the shank was nugged\").\n\n* **Contrapositive Statement:** The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order.  The contrapositive of P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP (where \u00ac represents negation).\n\n* **Applying it to our problem:** The contrapositive of \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\" is \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\"\n\n* **Logical Equivalence:**  The original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
