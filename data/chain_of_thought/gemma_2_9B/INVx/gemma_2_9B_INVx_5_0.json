The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion of the original statement and then reversing their order. \n\nLet's break down the original statement:\n\n* **Hypothesis:** The zinger was fraggled.\n* **Conclusion:** The zinger was smoogled.\n\nNow, let's form the contrapositive:\n\n* **Negated Hypothesis:** The zinger was not fraggled.\n* **Negated Conclusion:** The zinger was not smoogled.\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of the original statement is: \"If the zinger was not fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled.\"\n\nThe key point is that a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
