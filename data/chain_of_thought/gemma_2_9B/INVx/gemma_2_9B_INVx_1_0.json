The original statement asserts that if P is true, then Q must also be true. The inverse statement asserts that if P is false, then Q must also be false.  These are not always the same.\n\n**Counterexample:**\n\nImagine a scenario where something can be zargled without being blimmed.  In this case, the original statement would still hold (if blimmed, then zargled), but the inverse would be false (not blimmed, but still zargled).\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
