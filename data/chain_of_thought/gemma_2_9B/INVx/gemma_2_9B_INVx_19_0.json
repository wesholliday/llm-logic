The original statement asserts that if P is true, then Q must also be true. The inverse statement asserts that if P is false, then Q must also be false.  \n\nWhile it's tempting to assume they are equivalent, consider a counterexample:\n\n* Imagine P is \"It is raining\" and Q is \"The ground is wet.\"\n\n* The original statement \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\" is generally true.\n* However, the inverse \"If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet\" is not always true. The ground could be wet due to other reasons (sprinklers, a burst pipe).\n\n**Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk was not plagged\" from the given statement.**\n\nAnswer: no \n",
