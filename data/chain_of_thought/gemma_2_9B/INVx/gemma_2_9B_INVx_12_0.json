            "content": "\\\nI need a step-by-step explanation.\n\nExplanation: \nWe can use the concept of logical equivalency to determine this.  The original statement is a conditional statement, meaning it has the form \"If P, then Q\".  \n\n* **Original statement:** If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint.  \n    * P: The smip was shripped.\n    * Q: The smip lupped the zoint.\n\n* **We want to see if this is logically equivalent to:** If the smip was not shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint.\n    *  P': The smip was not shripped.\n    *  Q': The smip did not lup the zoint.\n\n**Logical Equivalency:**\n\nA conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis (P) and the conclusion (Q) and then reversing their order.\n\n* **Contrapositive of the original statement:** If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped.\n\nNotice that the contrapositive is not the same as the statement we are trying to determine.  \n\n**Therefore, the original statement is not logically equivalent to \"If the smip was not shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint\".**\n\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
