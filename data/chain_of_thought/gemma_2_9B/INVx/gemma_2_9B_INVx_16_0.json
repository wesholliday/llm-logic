            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nThis question asks about the logical relationship between two statements.  The first statement is a conditional statement, meaning it proposes a cause-and-effect relationship.  \n\nLet's break down the original statement:\n\n* **If the sneg was crampled (hypothesis):** This is the condition that needs to be met.\n* **Then the sneg sproted the frink (conclusion):** This is the outcome that happens if the condition is met.\n\nTo determine if the second statement is a valid inference, we need to consider the logical structure of conditional statements.  A key concept is the idea of contrapositive.\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by:\n\n1. **Reversing the hypothesis and conclusion:**  If the sneg did not sprot the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\n2. **Negating both the hypothesis and conclusion:**\n\nThe original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they always have the same truth value.  \n\nIn our case, the second statement is the contrapositive of the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, the second statement is also true, and vice versa.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
