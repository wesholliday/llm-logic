The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order. \n\nLet's break down the original statement:\n\n* **Hypothesis:** The fribble was snurgled.\n* **Conclusion:** The fribble crinked.\n\nNow, let's negate both:\n\n* **Negated Hypothesis:** The fribble was not snurgled.\n* **Negated Conclusion:** The fribble did not crink.\n\nFinally, we reverse the order:\n\n* **Contrapositive:** If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nThis shows that the contrapositive of the original statement is logically equivalent to it.  Therefore, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n\n\n",
