It sets up a cause-and-effect relationship.  \n\n* **The Flaw:**  Just because the consequent (the truck being blue) is true, it doesn't automatically mean the antecedent (the car being red) is also true. There could be other reasons why the truck might be blue.\n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine this: The car is green, but the truck is blue. This scenario satisfies the original statement because the truck being blue is a consequence of a different cause (something other than the car being red).\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
