If P, then Q (where P and Q are propositions)\n2. P is true\n\nThen we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nIn our case:\n\n1. P: The apple was red\n2. Q: The banana was yellow\n\nWe are given that the second premise (The banana was yellow) is true.  Since the first premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana would be yellow, and the banana is indeed yellow, it logically follows that the apple must have been red. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
