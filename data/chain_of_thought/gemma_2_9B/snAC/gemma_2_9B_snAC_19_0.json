            "content": "\n\nExplanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument called a conditional statement.  The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" can be broken down into two parts:\n\n* **Hypothesis:** Tom watched football.\n* **Conclusion:** Jen watched basketball.\n\nWe are given that the conclusion (Jen watched basketball) is true.  However, in a conditional statement, the truth of the conclusion doesn't automatically guarantee the truth of the hypothesis.  \n\nThink of it this way: the statement only says that *if* Tom watched football, *then* Jen would watch basketball. It doesn't say anything about whether Tom actually *did* watch football.\n\nThere could be other reasons why Jen watched basketball, such as her simply enjoying the sport regardless of whether Tom watched football.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
