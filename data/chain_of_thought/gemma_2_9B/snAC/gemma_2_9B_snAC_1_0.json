If P, then Q (where P and Q are propositions)\n2. P is true\n\nThen we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: Mary was at the wedding\n* Q: Sue was at the wedding\n\nWe are given:\n\n* If P, then Q (If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding) is true.\n* Q (Sue was at the wedding) is true.\n\nTherefore, according to Modus Ponens, we can conclude that P (Mary was at the wedding) is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
