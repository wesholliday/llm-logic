If P, then Q (If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside)\n    2. P (The cat was outside)\n\n* Then we can conclude that Q is true (The dog was inside).\n\n* In this case, the first premise establishes a conditional relationship: if the dog is inside, the cat must be outside. \n\n* The second premise tells us the cat *is* outside.  \n\n* Since the cat being outside is a direct consequence of the dog being inside (according to the first premise), it logically follows that the dog must have been inside. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
