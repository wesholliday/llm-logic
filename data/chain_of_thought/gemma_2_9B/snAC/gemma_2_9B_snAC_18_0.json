If P, then Q (where P and Q are propositions)\n2. P is true\n\nThen we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The doll was plastic\n* Q: The truck was metal\n\nWe are given:\n\n* If P, then Q (If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal) is true.\n* Q (The truck was metal) is true.\n\nTherefore, according to Modus Ponens, we can conclude that P (The doll was plastic) must also be true. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
