P\n\nThen we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: Lisa bought the red shirt\n* Q: Mark bought the blue shirt\n\nWe are given:\n\n* Premise 1: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt (If P, then Q)\n* Premise 2: Mark bought the blue shirt (P)\n\nSince both premises are true, according to Modus Ponens, we can conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt (Q).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
