If P, then Q (where P and Q are propositions)\n2. P is true\n\nThen we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: Sam took a plane\n* Q: Erin took a train\n\nWe are given:\n\n* If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train (P -> Q)\n* Erin took a train (Q)\n\nSince we know both premises are true, we can apply Modus Ponens to conclude that Sam took a plane (P) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
