P\n\nThen we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The bear was in the cave\n* Q: The wolf was in the den\n\nWe are given:\n\n* Premise 1: If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den (If P, then Q)\n* Premise 2: The wolf was in the den (P)\n\nSince both premises are true, according to Modus Ponens, we can conclude that the first part of the conditional statement (P) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
