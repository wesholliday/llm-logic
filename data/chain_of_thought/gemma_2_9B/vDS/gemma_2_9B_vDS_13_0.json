The second premise then negates one of those possibilities, stating that the toy is NOT on the shelf. \n\nSince the first premise establishes that only one of the options can be true, and the second premise eliminates one option, the only remaining possibility is that the toy must be in the toy box. This makes the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
