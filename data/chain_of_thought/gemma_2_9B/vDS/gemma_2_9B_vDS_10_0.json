A disjunctive syllogism is a type of logical argument that follows this structure:\n\n* Premise 1: P or Q\n* Premise 2: Not P\n* Conclusion: Therefore, Q\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The missing sock is in the laundry basket\n* Q: The missing sock is under the bed\n\nPremise 1 states that the sock is either in the laundry basket or under the bed (P or Q).
