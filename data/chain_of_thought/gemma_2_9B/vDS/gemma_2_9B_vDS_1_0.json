A disjunctive syllogism is a type of logical argument that uses a disjunction (an \"or\" statement) as one of its premises.  \n\nHere's how it works:\n\n* **Premise 1:**  Sets up the disjunction: Fido is either inside or in the garden.\n* **Premise 2:**  Negates one of the options in the disjunction: Fido is not in the garden.\n* **Conclusion:**  Therefore, the remaining option must be true: Fido is inside.\n\nSince the premises logically lead to the conclusion, this argument form is valid. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
