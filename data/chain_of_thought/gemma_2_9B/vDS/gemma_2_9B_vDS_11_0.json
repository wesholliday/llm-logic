A disjunctive syllogism is a type of logical argument that uses the disjunction (or) to present two mutually exclusive alternatives.  \n\nIn this case, the first premise presents two possibilities: the newspaper is in the driveway or it is on the porch. The second premise then eliminates one of these possibilities by stating that the newspaper is *not* on the porch.  \n\nSince the two possibilities are mutually exclusive (they cannot both be true at the same time), if one is false, the other must be true. Therefore, if the newspaper is not on the porch, it must be in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
