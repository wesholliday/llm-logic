The second premise then negates one of those possibilities, stating that the cookies are NOT hidden in the pantry.\n\nSince the premises establish that there are only two options and one has been ruled out, the only remaining possibility is that the cookies must be in the jar. This makes the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
