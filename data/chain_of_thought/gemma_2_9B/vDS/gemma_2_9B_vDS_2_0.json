The second premise then negates one of those possibilities, stating that the book is NOT on the table. \n\nSince the premises establish that the book must be in one of the two states and we know it's not on the table, the only remaining possibility is that it must be on the shelf. This makes the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
