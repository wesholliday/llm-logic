A disjunctive syllogism is a type of logical argument that follows this structure:\n\n* Premise 1: P or Q\n* Premise 2: Not P\n* Conclusion: Therefore, Q\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The pen is in my bag\n* Q: The pen is on my desk\n\nPremise 1 states that the pen is either in my bag or on my desk (a disjunction). Premise 2 states that the pen is not on my desk (negation of Q).  \n\nTherefore, if the first premise is true and the second premise is true, the only remaining possibility is that the conclusion, the pen being in my bag, must also be true.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
