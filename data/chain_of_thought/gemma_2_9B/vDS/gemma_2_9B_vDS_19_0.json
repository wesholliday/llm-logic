A disjunctive syllogism is a type of logical argument that follows this pattern:\n\n* Premise 1: P or Q\n* Premise 2: Not P\n* Conclusion: Therefore, Q\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The watch is charging on the dresser\n* Q: The watch is on his wrist\n\nThe argument is valid because if the first premise is true (the watch is either charging or on his wrist) and the second premise is true (it's not on his wrist), then the only remaining possibility is that the first option (charging on the dresser) must be true. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
