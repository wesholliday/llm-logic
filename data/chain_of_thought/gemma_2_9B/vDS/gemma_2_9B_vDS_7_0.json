A disjunctive syllogism is a type of logical argument that uses the disjunction (or) to present two mutually exclusive alternatives.  \n\nIn this case, the first premise presents two possibilities: the umbrella is in the car or it's in the closet. The second premise then rules out one of those possibilities (it's not in the closet).  \n\nSince the two possibilities are mutually exclusive (it can't be in both places at the same time), if one is false, the other must be true. Therefore, if the umbrella isn't in the closet, it must be in the car.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
