A disjunctive syllogism is a type of logical argument that uses the word \"or\" to present two mutually exclusive alternatives.  \n\nHere's how it breaks down:\n\n* **Premise 1:**  \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it is blending in on the floor.\" This sets up the two possibilities.\n* **Premise 2:** \"The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor.\" This eliminates one of the possibilities.\n* **Conclusion:** \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box.\"  Since the first possibility is ruled out, the remaining possibility must be true.\n\nBecause the premises logically lead to the conclusion, this argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
