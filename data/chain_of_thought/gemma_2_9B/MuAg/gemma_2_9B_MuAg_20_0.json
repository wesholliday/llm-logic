The second statement \"The event must have been formal and required tickets\"  is a rephrasing of the original statement, using \"and\" to combine the two clauses.  \n\nSince the second statement is a direct rephrasing of the first statement, it logically follows from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
