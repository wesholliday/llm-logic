            "content": "*must* implies a necessity or obligation.\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe original statement uses \"must have\" which implies a strong sense of necessity or obligation in the past.  The question asks if we can infer a similar sense of necessity from the original statement.\n\nThe phrase \"must have been completed\" implies that completion by Friday was a requirement.  \n\nThe phrase \"must have been under budget\" implies that staying under budget was a requirement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that both completion by Friday and staying under budget were necessary conditions for the project.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
