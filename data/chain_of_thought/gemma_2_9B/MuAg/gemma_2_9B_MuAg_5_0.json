This suggests that the speaker believes it is very likely that both the delivery and the signature occurred.  \n\nThe second statement, \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for\"  is a direct restatement of the original statement.  \n\nTherefore, we can infer that the two statements are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
