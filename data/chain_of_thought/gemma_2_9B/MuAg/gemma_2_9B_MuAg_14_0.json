This means both conditions need to be true.  The word \"and\" indicates a conjunction, requiring both parts to be met.\n\nThe rephrased statement says \"The contract must have been valid for a year **and been renewable**\". This also uses \"and\", implying both conditions are necessary.\n\nSince both statements use \"and\" to connect two conditions, and the conditions themselves are the same, we can infer that they mean the same thing.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
