However, it presents two separate claims:\n\n1. The concert must have been sold out.\n2. The concert must have started at 8 PM.\n\nWhile the original statement suggests both claims are likely true, it doesn't definitively prove that *both* are true simultaneously.  There's a possibility that one claim could be true while the other is false.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
