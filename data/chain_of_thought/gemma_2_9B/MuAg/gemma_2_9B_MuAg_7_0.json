This suggests that the speaker believes the exam was difficult and covered all chapters with a high degree of confidence.  \n\nThe inferred statement also uses \"must have,\" implying the same level of certainty.  \n\nSince the original statement expresses a belief with a high degree of certainty, and the inferred statement reflects that same level of certainty, it is reasonable to infer that the exam must have been difficult and covered all chapters. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
