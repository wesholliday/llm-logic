It sets up a cause-and-effect relationship: if one thing is true (fraggled), then another thing must also be true (smoogled).\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the zinger must have been smoogled.\" This statement is the negation of the consequence in Statement 1. It's saying that we can't definitively say the zinger *must* have been smoogled.\n\nNow, let's think about the logic:\n\nIf Statement 1 were true, and Statement 2 were also true, it would mean that something could be fraggled without being smoogled. This contradicts the original conditional statement.  Therefore, for both statements to be true, Statement 1 must be false.\n\nSince Statement 1 is false, it means the premise \"the zinger was fraggled\" is not necessarily true.  \n\nAnswer: \nyes \n\n\n",
