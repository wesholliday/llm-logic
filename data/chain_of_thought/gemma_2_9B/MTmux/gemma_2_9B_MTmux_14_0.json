It implies that if the first part (antecedent) is true (the clug was fleeked), then the second part (consequent) must also be true (the clug must have been snugged).\n\n* **Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the clug must have been snugged.\"** This statement negates the consequent of the conditional statement. It means that we cannot definitively say the clug must have been snugged.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical relationship between these statements and the conclusion:\n\n* **Conclusion: \"The clug was not fleeked.\"**  This statement negates the antecedent of the conditional statement.\n\nWe can use a truth table or a logical reasoning approach to determine the validity of the conclusion.  Since the consequent of the conditional statement is negated in statement 2, it weakens the connection between the antecedent and the consequent.  This means that even if the clug was fleeked, we can't be sure it was snugged.  Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the clug was not fleeked.\n\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
