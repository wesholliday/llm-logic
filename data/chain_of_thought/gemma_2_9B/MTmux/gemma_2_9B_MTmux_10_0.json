It says that if a certain condition (being sproinged) is true, then another condition (being garpled) must also be true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the wug must have been garpled.\" This statement is the negation of the consequent (the second part) of the first statement. It's saying that we can't definitively say the wug *must* have been garpled.\n\n**Analyzing the Logic**\n\nWe can use a truth table to help us visualize the logic:\n\n| Sproinged | Garpled | Statement 1 | Statement 2 |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| True | True | True | True |\n| True | False | False | True |\n| False | True | True | True |\n| False | False | True | True |\n\n* **Statement 1** is only false when the wug is sproinged but not garpled.\n\n* **Statement 2** is true in all cases except when the wug must have been garpled.\n\n**Finding the Inference**\n\nWe are looking to see if we can infer that the wug was *not* sproinged.  Notice that the only scenario where both statements are true is when the wug is not sproinged. \n\nExplanation: \nAnswer: yes",
