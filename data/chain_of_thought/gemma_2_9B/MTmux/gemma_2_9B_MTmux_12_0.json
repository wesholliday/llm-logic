(This is a conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the smip must have lupped the zoint. (This is the negation of the consequent of the conditional statement)\n\n**Modus Tollens:**\n\nModus tollens is a valid argument form that states:\n\nIf P, then Q.\nNot Q.\nTherefore, not P.\n\n**Applying Modus Tollens:**\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The smip was shripped\n* Q: The smip must have lupped the zoint\n\nWe are given:\n\n* Premise 1: If P, then Q\n* Premise 2: Not Q\n\nTherefore, according to modus tollens, we can conclude:\n\n* Not P\n\n**Answer:** \nyes \n\n\n",
