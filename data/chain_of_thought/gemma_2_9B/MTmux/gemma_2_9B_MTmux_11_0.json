It says that if one thing (blummed) happens, then another thing (zimmed) *must* also happen.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed.\" This statement is the negation of the consequent (the \"then\" part) of the first statement.\n\n**Analyzing the Logic**\n\nWe can use a truth table to help visualize the logic:\n\n| Flug Blummed | Flug Zimmed | Statement 1 True | Statement 2 True |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| True | True | True | False |\n| True | False | False | True |\n| False | True | True | False |\n| False | False | True | True |\n\nLet's break down why:\n\n* **Statement 1 is true** only when the flug is blummed AND zimmed.\n* **Statement 2 is true** only when the flug is NOT necessarily zimmed.\n\nNotice that the only scenario where both statements can be true is when the flug was not blummed (the first row of the table).\n\n**Answer:** \nyes",
