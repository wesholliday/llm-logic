It implies that if the first part (the splat was morphed) is true, then the second part (the splat must have quanked) is also true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the splat must have quanked.\" This statement is the negation of the consequent (the second part) of the conditional statement.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship:\n\n*  If the splat was morphed, it *must* have quanked (from Statement 1).\n*  But Statement 2 tells us that the splat *must not* have quanked.\n\nThese two statements contradict each other.  The only way to resolve this contradiction is if the first part of the conditional statement (the splat was morphed) is false.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n\n\n",
