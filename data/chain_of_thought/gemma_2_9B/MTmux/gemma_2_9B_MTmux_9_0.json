It sets up a cause-and-effect relationship: if a certain event (plinked) happens, then another event (varnished) must also happen.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the twonk must have been varnished.\"** This statement negates the conclusion of the conditional statement. It tells us that we cannot definitively say the twonk *must* have been varnished.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Can we infer 'The twonk was not plinked'?\"\n\nTo determine this, we need to think about the possible scenarios:\n\n* **Scenario 1: The twonk was plinked.**  If this were true, then according to Statement 1, it must have been varnished. However, Statement 2 tells us we can't be sure it was varnished. This creates a contradiction.\n\n* **Scenario 2: The twonk was not plinked.**  In this case, Statement 1 doesn't apply, and Statement 2 doesn't contradict anything.\n\nTherefore, the only scenario that doesn't lead to a contradiction is if the twonk was not plinked.\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
