It can be represented symbolically as: \n   *  P \u2192 Q (where P = \"the fleeg was bluttered\" and Q = \"it must have been surned\")\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned.\" This is the negation of Q:\n   * \u00acQ\n\nNow we want to determine if we can infer \u00acP (the fleeg was not bluttered).\n\nWe can use a truth table to analyze the possibilities:\n\n| P | Q | P \u2192 Q | \u00acQ |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| T | T | T | F |\n| T | F | F | T |\n| F | T | T | F |\n| F | F | T | T |\n\nLooking at the truth table, we see that the only scenario where both P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ are true is when P is false (the fleeg was not bluttered).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
