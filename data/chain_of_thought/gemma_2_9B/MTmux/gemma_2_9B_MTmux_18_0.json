It means that if the first part (antecedent) is true (shank was plooked), then the second part (consequent) must also be true (shank must have been nugged).\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the shank must have been nugged.\" This statement negates the consequent of the first statement. It means that we cannot definitively say the shank must have been nugged.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical relationship:\n\nIf the first statement were true, and the second statement were also true, it would create a contradiction.  This is because the first statement says that if the shank was plooked, it *must* be nugged, while the second statement says it's *not* a certainty that the shank was nugged.\n\nTherefore, for the two statements to be consistent, the first statement must be false.  \n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
