It implies that if the first part (the glip was slogged) is true, then the second part (the glip must have tragged) is also true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the glip must have tragged.\" This statement is the negation of the consequent (the second part) of the conditional statement.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship:\n\nIf the glip *was* slogged, then according to Statement 1, it *must* have tragged. However, Statement 2 tells us that it's *not* the case that the glip *must* have tragged. This means the glip might have tragged for other reasons, or it might not have tragged at all.\n\nSince the glip not necessarily having tragged contradicts the implication of Statement 1, we can conclude that the glip was not slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes \n\n\n",
