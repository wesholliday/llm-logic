It can be represented symbolically as:\n\n   * P \u2192 Q (where P = \"the sneg was crampled\" and Q = \"the sneg must have sproted the frink\")\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink.\" This can be represented as:\n\n   * \u00acQ\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can infer \"The sneg was not crampled\" (\u00acP).\n\n**The Contrapositive:**\n\nA key concept here is the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order.  The contrapositive of P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP.\n\n**Applying the Contrapositive:**\n\n1. **Our original statement:** P \u2192 Q\n2. **Contrapositive:** \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\n3. **We are given:** \u00acQ (It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink)\n\n4. **Therefore, using the contrapositive, we can infer:** \u00acP (The sneg was not crampled).\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
