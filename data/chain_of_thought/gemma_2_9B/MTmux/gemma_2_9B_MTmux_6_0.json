(This is a conditional statement, symbolized as P -> Q)\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink. (This is the negation of Q, symbolized as ~Q)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer that the grommet was not sploffed (symbolized as ~P).\n\nWe can use the rule of **modus tollens** to help us here. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (P -> Q) and the negation of the consequent (Q), then we can infer the negation of the antecedent (P).\n\nApplying this to our problem:\n\n* P -> Q (If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink)\n* ~Q (It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink)\n\nTherefore, we can infer ~P (The grommet was not sploffed).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
