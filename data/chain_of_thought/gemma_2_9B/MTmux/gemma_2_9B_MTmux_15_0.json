It can be represented symbolically as:  \n   *  P \u2192 Q (where P = \"the dreb was vroombed\" and Q = \"the dreb must have been spened\")\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the dreb must have been spened.\" This is the negation of Q:\n   * \u00acQ\n\nNow we want to determine if we can infer \"The dreb was not vroombed\" (\u00acP).\n\nWe can use a truth table to analyze the possibilities:\n\n| P | Q | P \u2192 Q | \u00acQ |\n|---|---|-------|-----|\n| T | T | T    | F   |\n| T | F | F    | T   |\n| F | T | T    | F   |\n| F | F | T    | T   |\n\nLooking at the table, the only scenario where both Statement 1 (P \u2192 Q) and Statement 2 (\u00acQ) are true is when P is false (the dreb was not vroombed).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
