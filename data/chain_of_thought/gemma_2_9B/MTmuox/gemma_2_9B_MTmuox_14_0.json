It doesn't definitively say it wasn't snugged, just that it's not a necessary condition.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged.\"** This statement establishes a conditional relationship. It says that if the clug was fleeked, then snugging was a guaranteed outcome.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The clug was not fleeked\"?\n\nTo determine this, we can use a technique called \"modus tollens.\" Modus tollens is a valid argument form that states:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The clug was fleeked.\n* Q: The clug must have been snugged.\n\nWe know from Statement 2 that if P is true (the clug was fleeked), then Q must also be true (it must have been snugged).  Statement 1 tells us that it's possible the clug was *not* snugged.  \n\nTherefore, if the clug was not snugged, then it couldn't have been fleeked (because Statement 2 says fleeking *always* leads to snugging).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
