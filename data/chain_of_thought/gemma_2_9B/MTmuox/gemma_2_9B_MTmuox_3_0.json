            "content": "\n\nExplanation: \nLet's break down the statements and analyze their logical relationships:\n\n* **Statement 1: \"It's not the case that the splat must have quanked.\"**  This statement is essentially saying that it's possible the splat did *not* quank. It doesn't definitively say it didn't quank, just that it's not a necessary condition.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked.\"** This statement introduces a conditional relationship. It says that if the splat *were* morphed, then quanking would be a guaranteed outcome.\n\nNow, to determine if we can infer \"The splat was not morphed,\" let's consider the possibilities:\n\n* **Scenario 1: The splat was morphed.**  If this were true, then according to Statement 2, the splat *must* have quanked. However, Statement 1 says it's possible the splat didn't quank. This creates a contradiction.\n\n* **Scenario 2: The splat was not morphed.**  This scenario doesn't violate either statement. Statement 1 allows for the possibility of the splat not quanking, and Statement 2 doesn't make any claims about the splat quanking if it wasn't morphed.\n\nSince Scenario 1 leads to a contradiction, the only logically consistent scenario is Scenario 2. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
