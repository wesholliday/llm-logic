It doesn't definitively say it wasn't varnished, just that it's not a necessary condition.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished.\"** This statement establishes a conditional relationship. It says that if the twonk was plinked, then varnishing was a guaranteed outcome.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Can we infer 'The twonk was not plinked'?\"\n\nTo answer this, we need to see if the given statements logically lead to the conclusion.  We can use a truth table or a more intuitive approach:\n\n* **Assume the twonk was plinked.**  If this were true, then according to Statement 2, it *must* have been varnished.  But Statement 1 says it's possible the twonk wasn't varnished. This creates a contradiction.\n\n* **Therefore, our initial assumption that the twonk was plinked must be false.**\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
