It doesn't give us a definitive answer about whether it was smoogled.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger must have been smoogled.\" This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the zinger is fraggled, then it's guaranteed to be smoogled.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Can we infer 'The zinger was not fraggled'?\"\n\nTo answer this, we need to see if the given statements logically lead to the conclusion.  If the zinger *was* fraggled, then according to statement 2, it *must* have been smoogled. However, statement 1 doesn't rule out the possibility of the zinger being smoogled in other ways besides being fraggled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the zinger was not fraggled. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
