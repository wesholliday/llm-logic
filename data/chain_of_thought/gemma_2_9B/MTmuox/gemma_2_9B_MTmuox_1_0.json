It asserts that if the flugel was blimmed, then zargling was a guaranteed consequence.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Can we infer 'The flugel was not blimmed'?\"\n\nTo determine this, we need to see if the given statements logically lead to the conclusion.  We can use a truth table or a more conceptual approach:\n\n* **Assume the flugel was blimmed.**  If this were true, then according to Statement 2, the flugel *must* have been zargled.\n\n* **But Statement 1 says it's not necessarily true that the flugel was zargled.**\n\nThis creates a contradiction. If the flugel was blimmed, it *must* be zargled, but it's not *necessarily* true that it was zargled.  \n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that the flugel was blimmed must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
