It doesn't definitively say it didn't happen, just that it's not a necessary condition.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink.\" This statement establishes a conditional relationship. It says that if the sneg was in a state of being \"crampled,\" then sproting the frink was a guaranteed outcome.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Can we infer 'The sneg was not crampled'?\"\n\nTo answer this, we need to see if the given statements logically lead to the conclusion.  If the sneg *was* crampled, then according to statement 2, it *must* have sproted the frink. However, statement 1 says it's *possible* the sneg didn't sproted the frink.  \n\nThis creates a contradiction.  Therefore, the only way to reconcile the statements is if the sneg was *not* crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
