There could be other reasons why the fribble didn't crink.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked.\"** This statement establishes a conditional relationship: if the fribble was snurgled, then crinkling is guaranteed.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Can we infer 'The fribble was not snurgled'?\"\n\nTo determine this, we need to see if the given statements logically lead to the conclusion.  We can use a technique called \"proof by contradiction.\"\n\n1. **Assume the opposite:** Let's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that the fribble *was* snurgled.\n\n2. **Analyze the consequences:** If the fribble was snurgled (our assumption), then according to Statement 2, it *must* have crinked.\n\n3. **Conflict with Statement 1:** However, Statement 1 tells us that it's not necessarily true that the fribble *must* have crinked.\n\n4. **Contradiction:** We've reached a contradiction! Our initial assumption that the fribble was snurgled cannot be true if Statement 1 is also true.\n\nTherefore, the only logical conclusion is that our initial assumption was wrong.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
