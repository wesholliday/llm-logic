It doesn't definitively say it wasn't spened, just that it's not a necessary condition.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened.\"** This statement establishes a conditional relationship. It says that if the dreb was vroombed, then spening is a guaranteed consequence.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Can we infer 'The dreb was not vroombed'?\"\n\nTo determine this, we can use a technique called \"modus tollens.\" Modus tollens is a valid argument form that states:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nApplying this to our statements:\n\n* P: The dreb was vroombed.\n* Q: The dreb must have been spened.\n\nWe know from Statement 1 that it's not necessarily true that the dreb was spened (not Q).  \n\nTherefore, using modus tollens, we can infer that it's possible the dreb was not vroombed (not P).\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
