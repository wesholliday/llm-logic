There could be other possibilities.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled.\"** This statement establishes a conditional relationship: if the wug was sproinged, then it definitely was also garpled.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Can we infer 'The wug was not sproinged'?\"\n\nTo determine this, we need to see if the given statements logically lead to the conclusion.  We can use a truth table or a more intuitive approach:\n\n* **Assume the wug was sproinged.**  According to Statement 2, if the wug was sproinged, it *must* have been garpled.  \n\n* **But Statement 1 says the wug might not have been garpled.** This creates a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that the wug was sproinged must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
