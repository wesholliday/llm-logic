It doesn't definitively say it didn't tragged, just that it's not a necessary condition.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged.\"** This statement establishes a conditional relationship. It says that if the glip was in a state of being \"slogged,\" then it automatically follows that the glip was also \"tragged.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The glip was not slogged\"?\n\nTo determine this, we need to see if the given statements create a logical contradiction if we assume the opposite of what we want to infer.\n\n* **Assume the glip *was* slogged.**  If this were true, then according to Statement 2, the glip *must* have tragged.\n\n* **But Statement 1 says it's not necessarily true that the glip tragged.**\n\nThis creates a contradiction!  If the glip was slogged, it *must* have tragged, but we're also told it's not necessarily true that it tragged.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that the glip was slogged must be false.\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
