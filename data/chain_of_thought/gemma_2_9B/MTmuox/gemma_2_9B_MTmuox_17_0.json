It doesn't definitively say it didn't, just that it's not a necessary condition.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated.\"** This statement presents a conditional relationship. It says that if the flob was skizzled, then movation is guaranteed.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The flob was not skizzled\"?\n\nTo do this, we need to see if the given statements create a situation where the only logical possibility is that the flob wasn't skizzled.  \n\nWe know:\n\n* The flob might not have movated.\n* If the flob *was* skizzled, it *must* have movated.\n\nThese statements don't directly contradict each other. It's possible the flob was skizzled and movated, or it's possible the flob was skizzled and didn't movate (which would violate statement 2).\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the flob was not skizzled.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
