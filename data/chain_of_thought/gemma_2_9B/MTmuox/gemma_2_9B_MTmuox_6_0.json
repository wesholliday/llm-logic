It doesn't definitively say it didn't happen, just that it's not a necessary condition.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink.\" This statement establishes a conditional relationship. It says that if the grommet was in a state of being \"sploffed,\" then it automatically followed that the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The grommet was not sploffed\"?\n\nTo answer this, we need to think about how the statements relate.  If we assume the grommet *was* sploffed, then according to Statement 2, it *must* have plopped the frink. However, Statement 1 says it's not *necessary* for the grommet to have plopped the frink. This creates a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the assumption that the grommet was sploffed must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
