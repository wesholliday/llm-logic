This is a disjunction, meaning one or the other (or both) must be true.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** The watch isn't on his wrist. This statement negates the first part of the disjunction.\n\nSince the disjunction must be true, and the first part is false (the watch isn't on his wrist), the only remaining possibility is that the second part must be true. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
