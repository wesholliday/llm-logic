This is a disjunction, meaning one or the other must be true.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** The shoes aren't lined up by the door. This statement negates the first part of the disjunction.\n\nSince the first part of the disjunction is false (the shoes aren't by the door), the second part must be true for the original disjunction to hold. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
