This is a disjunction, meaning one or the other must be true.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** The remote control isn't hiding under the couch. This statement negates one part of the disjunction.\n\nSince we know the first statement must be true (one of the options has to be true), and the second statement tells us the first option is false, the only remaining possibility is that the remote control must be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
