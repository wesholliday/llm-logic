This is a disjunction, meaning one or the other must be true.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** The missing sock isn't under the bed. This statement negates the first part of the disjunction.\n\nSince the disjunction must be true, and the first part is false (not under the bed), the only remaining possibility is that the sock must be in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
