This means the flimble has the possibility of zoobling either the crunk or the zizz, but not necessarily both.  \n\nThe word \"or\" in this context implies exclusivity. It suggests that the flimble can choose one or the other, not both at the same time.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively say that the flimble might zooble both the crunk and the zizz. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
