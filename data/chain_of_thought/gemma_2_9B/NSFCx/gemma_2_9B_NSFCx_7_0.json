This implies that the blimp has the potential to perform either action, but not necessarily both.  The word \"or\" suggests a disjunction, meaning one action could happen, the other could happen, or neither could happen.  \n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively say that the blimp *might* both bimboozle and zizz the snork. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
