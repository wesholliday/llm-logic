Modus Ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know that P is true, we can conclude that Q is also true.\n\nLet's break down our statements:\n\n* **Statement 1:** The sprocket was daggled.\n* **Statement 2:** If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P = The sprocket was cranked.\n* Q = The sprocket was daggled.\n\nWe know that Q (the sprocket was daggled) is true from Statement 1. We also have the conditional statement (If P, then Q).  Therefore, according to Modus Ponens, we can conclude that P (the sprocket was cranked) is also true. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
