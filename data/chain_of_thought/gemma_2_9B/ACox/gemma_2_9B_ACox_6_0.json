The second premise states that Q is true.  \n\n3. **The fallacy:**  Affirming the consequent means assuming that because Q is true, P must also be true.  However, this isn't always the case. There could be other reasons why Q is true besides P.\n\n**Example:**\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n* If it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).\n* The ground is wet (Q).\n\nDoes this mean it *must* be raining (P)?  No, the ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled water, etc.).\n\n**In our case:**\n\nJust because the grommet plopped the frink doesn't necessarily mean it was sploffed. There might be other ways for a grommet to plop a frink.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
