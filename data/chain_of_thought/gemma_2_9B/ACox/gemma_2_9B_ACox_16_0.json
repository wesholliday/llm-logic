Modus Ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know P is true, we can conclude that Q is also true.\n\nLet's break down our statements:\n\n* **Statement 1:** The grommet was plopped.\n* **Statement 2:** If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet was plopped.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: The grommet was sploffed.\n* Q: The grommet was plopped.\n\nStatement 1 tells us Q is true (the grommet was plopped). Statement 2 tells us that if P is true, then Q is true.  Since Q is true, and we know the structure of the conditional statement, we can apply Modus Ponens to conclude that P must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
