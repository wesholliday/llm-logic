Modus Ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the statement P is true, we can conclude that Q is also true.\n\nLet's break down the statements:\n\n* **Statement 1:** The twonk was varnished. (This is our Q)\n* **Statement 2:** If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished. (This is our If P, then Q statement)\n\nSince we know the twonk was varnished (Q is true), and we have a statement saying that if it was plinked (P) it would be varnished (Q), we can conclude that the twonk must have been plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
