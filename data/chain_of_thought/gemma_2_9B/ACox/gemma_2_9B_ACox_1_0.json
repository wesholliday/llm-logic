Modus Ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know that P is true, we can conclude that Q is also true.\n\nLet's break down the statements:\n\n* **Statement 1:** The flugel was zargled. (This is our P)\n* **Statement 2:** If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled. (This is our If P, then Q statement)\n\nSince we know the flugel was zargled (P is true), and the second statement tells us that if the flugel was blimmed (P), then it would be zargled (Q), we can conclude that the flugel must have been blimmed.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n\n\n",
