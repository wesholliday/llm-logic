Modus Ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know P is true, we can conclude that Q is also true.\n\nLet's break down the statements:\n\n* **Statement 1:** The flug was zimmed. (This is our P)\n* **Statement 2:** If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed. (This is our conditional statement, If P, then Q)\n\nSince we know the flug was zimmed (P is true), and the second statement tells us that if the flug was blummed (P), then it would be zimmed (Q), we can conclude that the flug must have been blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes \n\n\n",
