The second statement sets up a conditional relationship: if the fribble was snurgled, then it would have been crinked.\n\nHowever, the second statement doesn't say anything about whether or not the fribble *was* snurgled. It only states a consequence of being snurgled.  \n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the fribble was snurgled just because it was crinked. There could be other reasons why the fribble was crinked.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
