The second statement sets up a conditional relationship: if the wug was flooped, then it was also bimmed.  \n\nHowever, the second statement doesn't say anything about whether or not the wug *was* flooped. It only says that *if* it was flooped, then it would have been bimmed.  \n\nSince we know the wug was bimmed, it's possible it was flooped, but it's also possible it was bimmed through some other means. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
