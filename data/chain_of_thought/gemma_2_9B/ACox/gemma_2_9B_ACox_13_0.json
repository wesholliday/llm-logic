P\n\nThen we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nLet's apply this to our problem:\n\n* P: The splat was morphed\n* Q: The splat was quanked\n\nWe are given:\n\n1. If the splat was morphed, then the splat was quanked (This is our \"If P, then Q\" statement)\n2. The splat was quanked (This is our \"P\" statement)\n\nSince both premises are true, according to Modus Ponens, we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n\n\n",
