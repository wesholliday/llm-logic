If P, then Q (conditional statement)\n2. P (affirmation of the antecedent)\n\nThen we can conclude:\n\n3. Q (affirmation of the consequent)\n\nLet's apply this to our example:\n\n* **P:** The wug was sproinged\n* **Q:** The wug was garpled\n\n* **Premise 1:** If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled. (This is our conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** The wug was garpled. (This is the affirmation of the consequent)\n\nWe can see that the structure of the argument follows Modus Ponens.  \n\nHowever, there's a catch!  While the structure is correct, the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow logically.  \n\nHere's why:\n\nThe first premise only tells us that *if* the wug was sproinged, *then* it would be garpled. It doesn't say that *being* garpled *means* the wug was sproinged. There could be other reasons why the wug was garpled.\n\n**Answer:** no \n",
