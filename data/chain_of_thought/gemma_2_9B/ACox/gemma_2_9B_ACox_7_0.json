Modus Ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the statement P is true, then we can conclude that Q is also true.\n\nLet's break down our statements:\n\n* **Statement 1:** The whiffle tinked.\n* **Statement 2:** If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: The whiffle was shanked.\n* Q: The whiffle tinked.\n\nStatement 1 tells us Q is true (the whiffle tinked). Statement 2 tells us that if P is true (the whiffle was shanked), then Q (the whiffle tinked) is also true.\n\nSince we know Q is true, and we know that P implies Q, we can conclude that P must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n\n\n",
