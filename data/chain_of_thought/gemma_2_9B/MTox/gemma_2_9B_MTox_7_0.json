Modus Tollens states:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down our statements:\n\n* **P:** The whiffle was shanked.\n* **Q:** The whiffle tinked.\n\n* **Statement 1:** The whiffle did not tink. (This is our \"Not Q\")\n* **Statement 2:** If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked. (This is our \"If P, then Q\")\n\nApplying Modus Tollens:\n\nSince we know the whiffle did not tink (Not Q), and we know that if it was shanked it would have tinked (If P, then Q), we can conclude that the whiffle was not shanked (Not P). \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
