Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's apply this to our problem:\n\n* **P:** The wug was flooped.\n* **Q:** The wug bimmed the zoint.\n\nWe are given:\n\n* **Statement 1:** The wug did not bim the zoint. (This is the same as \"Not Q\")\n* **Statement 2:** If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint. (This is \"If P, then Q\")\n\nSince we have the structure of Modus Tollens, we can conclude:\n\n* **Therefore, the wug was not flooped.** (Not P)\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
