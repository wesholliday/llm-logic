            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nWe can use a logical reasoning technique called Modus Tollens to solve this. Modus Tollens states:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down the statements:\n\n1. **P:** The smip was shripped.\n2. **Q:** The smip lupped the zoint.\n\n* **Statement 1:** 'The smip did not lup the zoint.'  This translates to \"Not Q\".\n* **Statement 2:** 'If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint.' This is our \"If P, then Q\" statement.\n\nSince we have \"Not Q\" and \"If P, then Q\", Modus Tollens allows us to conclude \"Not P\".\n\nAnswer: yes \n\n\n",
