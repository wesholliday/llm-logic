Modus tollens is a valid argument form that states:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down our statements:\n\n1. **P:** The shank was plooked.\n2. **Q:** The shank was nugged.\n\n* **Statement 1:** \"The shank was not nugged.\" This is our \"Not Q\" in the modus tollens form.\n* **Statement 2:** \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\" This is our \"If P, then Q\" statement.\n\nSince we know the shank was not nugged (Not Q), and we know that if it was plooked, it would have been nugged (If P, then Q), we can conclude that the shank was not plooked (Not P).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
