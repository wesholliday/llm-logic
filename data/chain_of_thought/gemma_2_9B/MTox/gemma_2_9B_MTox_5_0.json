It says that if the zinger possesses the property of being fraggled, then it must also possess the property of being smoogled.\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can conclude that the zinger was *not* fraggled.  \n\nNotice that the two statements don't directly contradict each other.  Statement 1 tells us the zinger isn't smoogled, and Statement 2 tells us that if it *were* fraggled, it *would* be smoogled.  \n\nSince we know the zinger isn't smoogled, and Statement 2 says fraggled things *must* be smoogled, the only way to satisfy both statements is if the zinger wasn't fraggled in the first place.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
