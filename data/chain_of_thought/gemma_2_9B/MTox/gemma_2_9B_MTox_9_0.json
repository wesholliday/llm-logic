Modus Tollens states:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down our statements:\n\n* **P:** The twonk was plinked.\n* **Q:** The twonk was varnished.\n\n1. **Statement 1:** \"The twonk was not varnished.\" This tells us **not Q**.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\" This is our \"If P, then Q\" statement.\n\n3. **Applying Modus Tollens:** Since we know not Q (the twonk was not varnished), and we have the \"If P, then Q\" statement, we can conclude that not P (the twonk was not plinked).\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
