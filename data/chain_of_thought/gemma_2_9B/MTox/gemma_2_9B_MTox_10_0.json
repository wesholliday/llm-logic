(This is our \"Not Q\")\n* **Premise 2:** If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled. (This is our \"If P, then Q\")\n\nApplying Modus Tollens, since we know the wug was not garpled (Not Q), and we know that if it was sproinged it would have been garpled (If P, then Q), we can conclude that the wug was not sproinged (Not P).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
