Modus Tollens states:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down the statements:\n\n1. **P:** The flug was blummed.\n2. **Q:** The flug was zimmed.\n\n* **Statement 1:** \"The flug was not zimmed.\" This translates to \"Not Q.\"\n* **Statement 2:** \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\" This translates to \"If P, then Q.\"\n\nApplying Modus Tollens:\n\nSince we have \"Not Q\" and \"If P, then Q\", we can conclude \"Not P\".\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The flug was not blummed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
