Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that states:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down our statements:\n\n1. **P:** The flugel was blimmed.\n2. **Q:** The flugel was zargled.\n\n* **Statement 1:** 'The flugel was not zargled.'  This is our 'Not Q'.\n* **Statement 2:** 'If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.' This is our 'If P, then Q'.\n\nSince we know 'Not Q' and we have the 'If P, then Q' statement, Modus Tollens allows us to conclude 'Not P'.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
