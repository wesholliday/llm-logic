Modus tollens is a valid argument form that states:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down our statements:\n\n1. **P:** The grommet was sploffed.\n2. **Q:** The grommet plopped the frink.\n\n* **Statement 1:** \"The grommet did not plop the frink.\" This translates to \"Not Q\".\n* **Statement 2:** \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\" This translates to \"If P, then Q\".\n\nSince we have \"Not Q\" and \"If P, then Q\", we can apply modus tollens to conclude \"Not P\".\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
