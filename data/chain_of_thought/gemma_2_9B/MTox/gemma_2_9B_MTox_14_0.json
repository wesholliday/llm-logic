Modus tollens is a valid argument form that states:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down our statements and apply this:\n\n* **Statement 1:** \"The clug did not snugged\"  This can be rephrased as \"Not Q\" where Q is \"the clug snugged\".\n* **Statement 2:** \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\" This is our \"If P, then Q\" statement, where P is \"the clug was fleeked\" and Q is \"the clug snugged\".\n\nSince we know \"Not Q\" (the clug did not snugged) and we have the \"If P, then Q\" statement, we can apply modus tollens to conclude \"Not P\".\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The clug was not fleeked\".\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
