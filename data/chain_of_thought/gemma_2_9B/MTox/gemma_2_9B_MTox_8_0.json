Modus Tollens states:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down our statements:\n\n* P: The sprocket was cranked.\n* Q: The sprocket was daggled.\n\n1. **\"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\"**  This is our first statement, which sets up the conditional relationship (P implies Q).\n\n2. **\"The sprocket was not daggled\"** This is our second statement, which tells us that Q is false.\n\n3. **Therefore, not P**  According to Modus Tollens, since Q is false and we know P implies Q, then P must also be false.\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
