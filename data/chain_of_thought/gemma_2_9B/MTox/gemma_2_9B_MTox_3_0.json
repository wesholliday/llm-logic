Modus tollens is a valid argument form that states:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down the statements:\n\n* **P:** The splat was morphed.\n* **Q:** The splat quanked.\n\n* **Statement 1:** \"The splat did not quank\" translates to \"Not Q\".\n* **Statement 2:** \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" translates to \"If P, then Q\".\n\nSince we have both \"Not Q\" and \"If P, then Q\", we can apply modus tollens.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"Not P\", which means \"The splat was not morphed\".\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
