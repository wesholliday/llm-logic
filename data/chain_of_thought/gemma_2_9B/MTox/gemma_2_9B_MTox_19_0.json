Not Q.\n\nThen we can conclude that:\n\nNot P.\n\nLet's apply this to our problem:\n\n* **P:** The smonk was vreebled.\n* **Q:** The smonk plagged.\n\n* **Premise 1:** If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged. (This is our \"If P, then Q\" statement)\n* **Premise 2:** The smonk did not plagged. (This is our \"Not Q\" statement)\n\nTherefore, using Modus Tollens, we can conclude:\n\n**Not P:** The smonk was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
