Modus Tollens states:\n\n* If P then Q\n* Not Q\n* Therefore, not P\n\nLet's apply this to our statements:\n\n* P: The dreb was vroombed\n* Q: The dreb was spened\n\n1. **\"The dreb was not spened\"**  This is our \"Not Q\" statement.\n\n2. **\"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\"** This is our \"If P then Q\" statement.\n\nSince we know Q is not true (the dreb was not spened), and we have the statement that if P were true, then Q would also be true, we can conclude that P must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
