Modus Tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know that Q is false, then we can conclude that P is also false.\n\nLet's break down our statements:\n\n* **Statement 1:** The sneg did not sproted the frink. (This is our Q statement)\n* **Statement 2:** If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink. (This is our P implies Q statement)\n\nSince Statement 1 tells us that the sneg did NOT sproted the frink (Q is false), and Statement 2 tells us that if the sneg WAS crampled, then it would have sproted the frink, we can conclude that the sneg was NOT crampled.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n\n\n",
