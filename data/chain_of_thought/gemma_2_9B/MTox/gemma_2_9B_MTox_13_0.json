Modus tollens is a valid argument form that states:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down the given statements:\n\n1. **\"The glip was not tragged\"**: This is our \"not Q\" statement.\n\n2. **\"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\"**: This is our \"If P, then Q\" statement.\n\nApplying modus tollens:\n\n* We know the glip was not tragged (not Q).\n* We know that if the glip was slogged, it would have been tragged (If P, then Q).\n\nTherefore, the glip must not have been slogged (not P).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
