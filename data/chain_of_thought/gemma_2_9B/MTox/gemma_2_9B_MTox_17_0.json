Modus Tollens states:\n\n* If P then Q\n* Not Q\n* Therefore, not P\n\nLet's break down our statements:\n\n* P: The flob was skizzled\n* Q: The flob movated\n\n1. **\"The flob did not movated\"** translates to \"Not Q\" in our logic.\n2. **\"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated\"** translates to \"If P then Q\".\n\nSince we have both \"Not Q\" and \"If P then Q\", we can apply Modus Tollens to conclude \"Not P\".\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
