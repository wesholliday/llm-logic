(This means there's a possibility she didn't)\n* **Conclusion:** It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt. (This means it's not certain she did)\n\nSince the premise allows for the possibility that Lisa didn't buy the shirt, the conclusion logically follows. If it's possible she didn't buy it, then it can't be a certainty that she did.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
