This means there's a possibility the toy is somewhere else.\n* **Conclusion:** It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box. This means we can't definitively say the toy is *required* to be in the toy box.\n\nNotice that the premise allows for the possibility the toy is not in the toy box, and the conclusion states that the toy is not *required* to be there.  These two statements are logically connected. If the toy *might* not be in the toy box, then it can't be said to *must* be there.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
