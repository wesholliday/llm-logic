It doesn't definitively state it wasn't written by him.\n\n* **Conclusion:** \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James.\" This means we can't say with certainty that James wrote the book.\n\nNotice that the conclusion essentially rephrases the premise. If the book might not have been written by James, then it can't be said with absolute certainty that it *must* have been written by him.  \n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. The conclusion follows directly from the premise. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
