This means there's a possibility the alien didn't visit Mars.\n* **Conclusion:** It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars. This means we can't definitively say the alien did visit Mars.\n\nNotice that the premise and conclusion essentially say the same thing.  The premise introduces a possibility of the alien *not* visiting Mars, and the conclusion states that we can't be certain the alien *did* visit Mars.  \n\nSince the conclusion follows directly from the premise, the argument is logically valid.  \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
