This means there's a possibility the notebook is somewhere else.\n* **Conclusion:** It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer. This means we can't definitively say the notebook is *only* in the drawer.\n\nNotice that the premise allows for the possibility of the notebook being elsewhere, which directly supports the conclusion. If the notebook isn't guaranteed to be in the drawer, then it can't be said to *must* be there.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
