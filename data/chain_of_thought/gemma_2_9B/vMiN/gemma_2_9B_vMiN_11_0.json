A disjunctive syllogism has the form:\n\n* P or Q\n* Not P\n* Therefore, Q\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The newspaper is in the driveway.\n* Q: The newspaper is not in the driveway.\n\nThe premise \"The newspaper might not be in the driveway\" can be rephrased as \"It is possible the newspaper is not in the driveway.\" This aligns with \"Not P\".\n\nThe conclusion \"It's not the case that the newspaper must be in the driveway\"  is logically equivalent to \"It is possible the newspaper is not in the driveway.\"\n\nSince the argument follows the structure of a disjunctive syllogism and the premises logically lead to the conclusion, the argument is **logically valid**.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
