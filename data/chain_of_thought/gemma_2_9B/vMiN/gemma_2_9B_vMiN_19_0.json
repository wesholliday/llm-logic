A disjunctive syllogism has the form:\n\n* P or Q\n* Not P\n* Therefore, Q\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The watch is charging on the dresser.\n* Q: The watch is not charging on the dresser.\n\nThe premise \"The watch might not be charging on the dresser\" can be rephrased as \"It is possible the watch is not charging on the dresser,\" which aligns with \"Not P.\"\n\nThe conclusion \"It's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser\" is logically equivalent to \"The watch is not necessarily charging on the dresser,\" which is the same as \"Q.\"\n\nSince the argument follows the structure of a disjunctive syllogism and the premises are logically connected, it is **logically valid**.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
