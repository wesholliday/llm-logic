This means there's a possibility the sunglasses are not in her bag.\n* **Conclusion:** It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag. This means we can't definitively say the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nNotice that the premise and conclusion essentially say the same thing.  The premise introduces a possibility of the sunglasses *not* being in the bag, and the conclusion states that it's not certain they *are* in the bag.  \n\nSince the conclusion follows directly from the premise, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
