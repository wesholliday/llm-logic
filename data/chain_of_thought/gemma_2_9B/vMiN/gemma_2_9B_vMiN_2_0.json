This means there's a possibility the griffin wasn't there.\n* **Conclusion:** It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest. This means we can't definitively say the griffin was in the forest.\n\nNotice that the conclusion doesn't directly follow from the premise.  The premise only suggests a possibility, not a certainty.  It's possible the griffin wasn't in the forest, but that doesn't automatically mean it *mustn't* have been. There could be other possibilities.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
