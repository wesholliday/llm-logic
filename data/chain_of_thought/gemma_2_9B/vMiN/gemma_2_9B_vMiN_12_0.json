This means there's a possibility the jacket is not on the chair.\n* **Conclusion:** It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair. This means the jacket is not definitely or necessarily on the chair.\n\nNotice that the conclusion is a weaker statement than the premise. The premise allows for the possibility of the jacket not being on the chair, and the conclusion simply states that it's not a certainty that it is.  \n\nSince the conclusion follows logically from the premise, the argument is valid. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
