We have a conditional statement (If P, then Q).\n2. We are given that the antecedent (P) is true.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that the consequent (Q) is also true.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: The apple was red\n* Q: The banana was yellow\n\nThe first premise provides the conditional statement. The second premise states that P (the apple was red) is true.  Therefore, according to the rules of modus ponens, we can conclude that Q (the banana was yellow) is also true.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
