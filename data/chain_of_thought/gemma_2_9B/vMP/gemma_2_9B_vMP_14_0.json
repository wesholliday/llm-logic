We are given that the antecedent (P) is true.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that the consequent (Q) is also true.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: The bear was in the cave\n* Q: The wolf was in the den\n\nThe argument follows the structure of modus ponens perfectly. Since the first premise establishes the conditional relationship and the second premise confirms the truth of the antecedent, the conclusion logically follows. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
