Modus ponens is a valid argument form where the conclusion follows logically from the premises. \n\nHere's how it works:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. (This sets up a conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** The dog was inside. (This affirms the antecedent of the conditional statement)\n* **Conclusion:** Therefore, the cat was outside. (This follows logically from the conditional statement and the affirmed antecedent)\n\nSince the conclusion directly follows from the premises in a way that is consistent with the rules of logic, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
