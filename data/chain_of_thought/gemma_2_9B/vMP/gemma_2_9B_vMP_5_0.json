Modus ponens is a valid argument form where the conclusion follows logically from the premises. \n\nHere's how it works:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If P, then Q (If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis)\n* **Premise 2:** P (Jeff played basketball)\n* **Conclusion:** Therefore, Q (Amy played tennis)\n\nSince the structure of the argument follows the rules of modus ponens, and the premises are true (we're assuming they are for this example), the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
