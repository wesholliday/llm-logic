Modus ponens is a valid argument form where the conclusion follows directly from the premises. \n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** If P, then Q (If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo)\n2. **Premise 2:** P (Joe went to the park)\n3. **Conclusion:** Therefore, Q (Lucy went to the zoo)\n\nSince the conclusion is a direct consequence of the premises, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
