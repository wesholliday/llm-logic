Here's why:\n\n* **Modus Ponens Structure:**  Modus ponens has the following structure:\n\n    1. If P, then Q.\n    2. P.\n    3. Therefore, Q.\n\n* **Applying it to our example:**\n\n    1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel (P -> Q)\n    2. The book was written by James (P)\n    3. Therefore, the book is a mystery novel (Q)\n\nSince the argument follows the valid structure of modus ponens, we can conclude that it is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
