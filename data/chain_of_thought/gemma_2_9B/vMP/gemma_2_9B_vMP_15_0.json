Modus ponens is a valid argument form where the conclusion follows directly from the premises. \n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. (This sets up a conditional statement)\n2. **Premise 2:** Sam took a plane. (This affirms the antecedent of the conditional statement)\n3. **Conclusion:** Therefore, Erin took a train. (This follows logically from the conditional statement and the affirmed antecedent)\n\nSince the conclusion is a direct consequence of the premises, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
