We have a conditional statement (If P, then Q).\n2. We are given that P is true.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nLet's break down our argument:\n\n* **Premise 1:** \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is our conditional statement (P -> Q).\n* **Premise 2:** \"The shirt was cotton\" tells us that P is true.\n* **Conclusion:** \"The pants were denim\" is our conclusion, which is Q.\n\nSince all the conditions of modus ponens are met, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
