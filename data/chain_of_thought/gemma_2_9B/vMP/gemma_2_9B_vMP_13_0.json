Modus ponens is a valid argument form where the conclusion follows directly from the premises. \n\nHere's how it works:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If P, then Q (If the car was red, then the truck was blue)\n* **Premise 2:** P (The car was red)\n* **Conclusion:** Therefore, Q (The truck was blue)\n\nSince the first premise establishes a conditional relationship (if the car is red, then the truck is blue), and the second premise confirms that the car *was* red, the conclusion logically follows.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
