Here's why:\n\n* **Modus Ponens Structure:** Modus ponens has the following structure:\n\n    * If P, then Q.\n    * P.\n    * Therefore, Q.\n\n* **Applying it to our example:**\n\n    * P: The alien visited Mars.\n    * Q: The robot visited Jupiter.\n\n* **The argument follows the structure of modus ponens:**\n\n    * Premise 1: If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter (If P, then Q).\n    * Premise 2: The alien visited Mars (P).\n    * Conclusion: Therefore, the robot visited Jupiter (Q).\n\nSince the argument follows a valid form, and the premises are assumed to be true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
