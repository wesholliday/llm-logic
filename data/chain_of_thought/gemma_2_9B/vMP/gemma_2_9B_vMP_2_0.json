We are given that the antecedent (P) is true.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that the consequent (Q) is also true.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: The griffin was in the forest.\n* Q: The unicorn was in the forest.\n\nThe argument follows the structure of modus ponens, and since modus ponens is a valid argument form, this argument is also logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
