We have a conditional statement (If P, then Q).\n2. We are given that the antecedent (P) is true.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that the consequent (Q) is also true.\n\nLet's break down our argument:\n\n* **Premise 1:** \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is our conditional statement (P -> Q).\n* **Premise 2:** \"The cake was chocolate\" tells us the antecedent (P) is true.\n* **Conclusion:** \"The muffins were blueberry\" is the consequent (Q).\n\nSince all the conditions of modus ponens are met, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
