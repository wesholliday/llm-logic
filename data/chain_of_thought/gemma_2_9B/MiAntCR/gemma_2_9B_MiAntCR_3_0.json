It doesn't specify *where* the car might be. \n\nThe second statement, \"The car might be in the garage and need repairs,\" adds a location constraint.  \n\nSince the first statement doesn't rule out the possibility of the car being in the garage, it's possible for both statements to be true. However, the first statement doesn't *guarantee* that the car is in the garage.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
