It seems to suggest that \"zizz\" must be \"quanked\" by something, and that something is specified as \"blimp or blimp\".  \n\nThe repetition of \"blimp\" is odd, and could indicate a grammatical error or a deliberate stylistic choice.  \n\nIf we assume the repetition is a mistake, then the statement simplifies to \"The zizz must be quanked by blimp\".  \n\nAnswer: \nyes \n\n\n",
