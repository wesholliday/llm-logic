The wump is quank on zibber.\n2. The wump is wobble for quank quork.\n\nThe statement uses the word \"or\", which means that at least one of these possibilities must be true.  \n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The wump must be quank on zibber\", we need to see if that possibility is guaranteed by the original statement.  It is not.  The original statement only says *at least one* of the possibilities must be true, not that the first possibility *must* be true.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
