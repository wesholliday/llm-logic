It seems to suggest a requirement for the \"flimble\" to be \"crunk\" with something, and it offers two options: \"plonk\" or \"on an quank wobble.\"  \n\nThe structure of the sentence implies that either option satisfies the requirement.  \n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The flimble must be crunk with plonk\" is a possible interpretation of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
