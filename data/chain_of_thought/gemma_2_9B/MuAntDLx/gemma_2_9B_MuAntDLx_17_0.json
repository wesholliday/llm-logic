This means it presents two possibilities: either the frazzle is frazzle, or the frazzle is gribble.  Since it's a must statement, it asserts that one of these possibilities *must* be true.  \n\nIf we isolate the first possibility, \"The frazzle must be frazzle,\" we see that it is a subset of the original disjunction.  Therefore, if the original statement is true, the first possibility *must* also be true.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n\n\n",
