This statement presents two possibilities: the floob can be \"wobble a flimble\" or it can be \"quibble\".  \n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"The floob must be wobble a flimble\".  Since the original statement says the floob *must* be *either* wobble a flimble *or* quibble, it doesn't definitively say it *must* be wobble a flimble. It's possible the floob is a quibble.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
