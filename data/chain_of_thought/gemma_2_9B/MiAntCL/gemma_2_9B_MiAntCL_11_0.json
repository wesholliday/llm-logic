It doesn't specify anything about restarting.\n    * \"The software might be updated and restarted\" means there is a possibility that the software will both be updated *and* restarted.\n\n* **Logical Implication:**\n\n    * For the first statement to logically imply the second, the second statement must always be true if the first statement is true.  \n\n* **Analysis:**\n\n    * It's possible for software to be updated without being restarted. Many updates are applied in the background and don't require a restart.\n\n    Therefore, the first statement does not necessarily imply the second statement. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
