Some formal events might require tickets (e.g., a gala, a concert), while others might not (e.g., a formal dinner party).\n\n* The original statement only tells us about the *potential formality* of the event, not anything about ticketing requirements.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively say that a formal event *must* require tickets. \n\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
