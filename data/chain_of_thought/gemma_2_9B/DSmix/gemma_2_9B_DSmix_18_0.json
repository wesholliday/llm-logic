It means one of two things must be true: the shank is plooked, or the shank must be nugged.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The shank might not be nugged\" This statement introduces the possibility that the shank is *not* nugged.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship:\n\n* If the shank is *not* nugged (as stated in Statement 2), then according to Statement 1, the shank *must* be plooked.\n\n* Therefore, we can infer that the shank is plooked. \n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
