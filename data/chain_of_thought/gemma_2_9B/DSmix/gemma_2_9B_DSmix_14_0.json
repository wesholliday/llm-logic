It means one of two things must be true: the clug is fleeked, or the clug is snugged.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The clug might not be snugged\" This statement tells us that it's possible the clug is not snugged.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship:\n\nIf the clug is not snugged (as stated in Statement 2), then according to Statement 1, the only other possibility is that it must be fleeked. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
