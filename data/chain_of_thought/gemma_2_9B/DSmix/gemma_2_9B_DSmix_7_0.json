It means one of two things must be true: the whiffle is shanked, or the whiffle is tinked.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The whiffle might not be tinked\" This statement introduces the possibility that the whiffle is *not* tinked.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n* If the whiffle is tinked, Statement 2 doesn't contradict Statement 1.\n* If the whiffle is *not* tinked, then Statement 1 forces the conclusion that it must be shanked.\n\nTherefore, since Statement 2 allows for the possibility that the whiffle is not tinked, we can infer that the whiffle must be shanked. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
