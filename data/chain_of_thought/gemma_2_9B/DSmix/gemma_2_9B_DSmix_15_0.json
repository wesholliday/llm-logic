It means one of two things must be true: the dreb is vroombed, or the dreb is spened.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The dreb might not be spened\" This statement tells us that it's possible the dreb is not spened.\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications:\n\nIf the dreb is not spened (as stated in Statement 2), then according to Statement 1, the dreb *must* be vroombed.  \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
