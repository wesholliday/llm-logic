It means one of two things must be true: the wug is flooped, or the wug is bimmed.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The wug might not be bimmed\" This statement tells us that it's possible the wug is *not* bimmed.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n* If the wug is *not* bimmed, then according to Statement 1, it *must* be flooped.\n\n* Statement 2 tells us it's possible the wug isn't bimmed.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the wug must be flooped. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
