It means one of two things must be true: the twonk is varnished, or the twonk must be plinked.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The twonk might not be plinked\" This statement introduces the possibility that the twonk is *not* plinked.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship:\n\n* If the twonk is *not* plinked, then according to Statement 1, it *must* be varnished.\n* Statement 2 tells us it's possible the twonk isn't plinked.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the twonk *must* be varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes \n\n\n",
