It means one of two things must be true: the grommet is sploffed, or the grommet is plopped.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The grommet might not be plopped\" This statement introduces the possibility that the grommet is *not* plopped.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\nIf the grommet is not plopped (as stated in Statement 2), then according to Statement 1, the only remaining possibility is that the grommet must be sploffed. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
