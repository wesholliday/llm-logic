It means that one of two things must be true: the splat is morphed, or the splat must be quanked.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The splat might not be quanked.\" This statement introduces the possibility that the splat is not quanked.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship between the statements:\n\n* If the splat is not quanked (as stated in Statement 2), then according to Statement 1, the splat *must* be morphed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes \n\n\n",
