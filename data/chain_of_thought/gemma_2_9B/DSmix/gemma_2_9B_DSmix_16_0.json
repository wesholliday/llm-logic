It means one of two things must be true: the sneg is crampled, or the sneg is sproted.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The sneg might not be sproted\" This statement tells us that it's possible the sneg is *not* sproted.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship:\n\n* If the sneg is *not* sproted (as stated in Statement 2), then according to Statement 1, the only remaining possibility is that the sneg *must* be crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
