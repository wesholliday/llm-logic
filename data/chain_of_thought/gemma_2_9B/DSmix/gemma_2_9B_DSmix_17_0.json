It says the flob has two possibilities: it's skizzled, or it's movated.\n\n* **Premise 2** introduces uncertainty about the flob being movated. It says it's *possible* the flob isn't movated.\n\nNow, consider the implications:\n\nIf the flob isn't movated (as per Premise 2), then Premise 1 tells us the only other possibility is that it *must* be skizzled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
