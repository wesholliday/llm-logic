It means one of two things must be true: the zinger is fraggled, or the zinger is smoogled.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The zinger might not be smoogled\" This statement introduces the possibility that the zinger is *not* smoogled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications:\n\nIf the zinger is *not* smoogled, then according to Statement 1, it *must* be fraggled.  Statement 2 allows for the possibility that the zinger is not smoogled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the zinger is fraggled. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
