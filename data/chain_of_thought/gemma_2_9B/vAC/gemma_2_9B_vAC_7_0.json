The first premise is a conditional statement, stating that if a certain condition (Alex finishing the race) is met, then another condition (Chris finishing the race) must also be met. The second premise states that the consequent (Chris finishing the race) is true.  To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion (Alex finishing the race) necessarily follows from the given premises.\n\nIn this case, the argument is not logically valid.  Even though Chris finished the race, we don't have enough information to conclude that Alex also finished. The first premise only tells us that *if* Alex finished, then Chris would have finished. It doesn't say anything about whether Alex actually did finish.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
