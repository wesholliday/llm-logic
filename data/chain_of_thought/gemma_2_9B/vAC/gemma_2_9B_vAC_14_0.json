Here's why:\n\n* **Modus Ponens Structure:** Modus ponens follows this structure:\n\n    * If P, then Q.\n    * P.\n    * Therefore, Q.\n\n* **Applying it to our example:**\n\n    * P: The bear was in the cave.\n    * Q: The wolf was in the den.\n\n    * Premise 1: If the bear was in the cave (P), then the wolf was in the den (Q).\n    * Premise 2: The wolf was in the den (Q).\n\n    Since the premises fit the modus ponens structure and the conclusion logically follows from the premises, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
