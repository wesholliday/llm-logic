This logical fallacy occurs when we assume that because the consequent (the second part of a conditional statement) is true, the antecedent (the first part) must also be true.  \n\nIn this case, the argument's structure is:\n\n* Premise 1: If P, then Q (If the car was red, then the truck was blue)\n* Premise 2: Q (The truck was blue)\n* Conclusion: P (The car was red)\n\nAffirming the consequent is not a valid form of reasoning because there could be other reasons why the truck was blue besides the car being red.  \n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
