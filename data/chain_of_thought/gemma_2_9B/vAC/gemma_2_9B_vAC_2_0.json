Here's why:\n\n* **Modus Ponens Structure:** Modus ponens has the following structure:\n\n    * If P, then Q\n    * P\n    * Therefore, Q\n\n* **Applying it to our example:**\n\n    * P = The griffin was in the forest\n    * Q = The unicorn was in the forest\n\n* **The argument follows the structure:**\n\n    * If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest (If P, then Q)\n    * The unicorn was in the forest (P)\n    * Therefore, the griffin was in the forest (Q)\n\nSince the argument follows the valid structure of modus ponens, it is a logically valid argument.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
