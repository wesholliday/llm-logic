            "content": "\n\nExplanation: \nThis argument is an example of a fallacy called \"affirming the consequent\".  Here's why:\n\n* **Understanding the Structure:** The argument has the form:\n\n    * If P, then Q.\n    * Q is true.\n    * Therefore, P is true.\n\n* **The Flaw:**  Just because the consequent (Q) is true, it doesn't automatically mean the antecedent (P) is also true.  There could be other ways for Q to be true besides P being true.\n\n* **Example:**\n\n    * If it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).\n    * The ground is wet (Q).\n    * Therefore, it's raining (P).\n\n    This doesn't necessarily follow. The ground could be wet for other reasons (like someone spilled water).\n\n* **Applying it to the Shirt/Pants Argument:**\n\n    We know the pants were denim (Q). But that doesn't mean the shirt *had* to be cotton (P) for that to be true. The shirt could have been made of a different material entirely.\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
