This logical fallacy occurs when we assume that because the consequent (the part that follows the \"then\") of a conditional statement is true, the antecedent (the part that comes before the \"then\") must also be true.  \n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\"  The second premise tells us that Lucy went to the zoo (the consequent is true).  However, this doesn't necessarily mean that Joe went to the park (the antecedent).  \n\nThere could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo, such as her friend taking her or her wanting to see the animals.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
