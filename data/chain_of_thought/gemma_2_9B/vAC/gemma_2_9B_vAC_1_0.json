Here's why:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. (This is a conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** Sue was at the wedding. (This is a statement about the truth of the consequent of the conditional statement)\n\nSince the consequent of the conditional statement in Premise 1 is true (Sue was at the wedding), and modus ponens is a valid form, we can logically conclude that the antecedent (Mary was at the wedding) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
