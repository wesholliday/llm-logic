Here's why:\n\n* **Modus Ponens Structure:**  Modus Ponens has the following structure:\n\n    * Premise 1: If P, then Q\n    * Premise 2: P\n    * Conclusion: Therefore, Q\n\n* **Applying it to our example:**\n\n    * P = The vampire was awake\n    * Q = The mummy was awake\n\n    * Premise 1: If the vampire was awake (P), then the mummy was awake (Q).\n    * Premise 2: The mummy was awake (Q).\n    * Conclusion: Therefore, the vampire was awake (P).\n\n* **Logical Validity:** Since the argument follows the structure of Modus Ponens, and the premises are true (we're assuming they are for this example), the conclusion must also be true.  \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
