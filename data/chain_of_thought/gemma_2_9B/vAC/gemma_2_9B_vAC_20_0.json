This is a fallacy because the structure of the argument doesn't guarantee the truth of the conclusion.  \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **The first premise sets up a conditional statement:** It tells us that if a certain condition (the apple being red) is met, then another condition (the banana being yellow) will also be met. \n* **The second premise confirms the consequent:** It states that the banana *was* yellow.\n* **The problem:**  Just because the consequent (banana being yellow) is true, it doesn't automatically mean the antecedent (apple being red) is also true. There could be other reasons why the banana was yellow.\n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine a scenario where the apple was green, but there was a separate reason why the banana was yellow (like it ripened). In this case, the premises would still be true, but the conclusion would be false.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
