There could be other ways for Q to be true besides P.\n\n* **Example:**\n\n    * If it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).\n    * The ground is wet (Q).\n    * Therefore, it's raining (P).\n\n    This doesn't necessarily follow. The ground could be wet for other reasons (e.g., someone spilled water).\n\n* **Applying it to the Basketball/Tennis Argument:**\n\n    We know Amy played tennis (Q). But, this doesn't guarantee Jeff played basketball (P).  There might be other reasons why Amy played tennis.\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
