This logical fallacy occurs when we assume that if the consequent (the \"then\" part) of a conditional statement is true, then the antecedent (the \"if\" part) must also be true.  \n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" The consequent is \"Mark bought the blue shirt,\" which is given as true in the second premise.  However, just because Mark bought the blue shirt doesn't necessarily mean Lisa bought the red shirt. There could be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
