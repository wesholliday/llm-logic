P.\n3. Therefore, Q.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P = The book was written by James\n* Q = The book is a mystery novel\n\nThe argument structure is valid because if the first premise (If P, then Q) is true, and the second premise (P) is also true, then the conclusion (Q) must also be true.  \n\nHowever,  the argument's *soundness* depends on whether the premises are actually true. \n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
