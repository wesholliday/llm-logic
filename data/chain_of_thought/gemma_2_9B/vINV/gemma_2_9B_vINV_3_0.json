The conclusion essentially negates the premise. If the first statement is true, the second statement must also be true.  \n\nThis type of argument structure is called \"contrapositive.\"  The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
