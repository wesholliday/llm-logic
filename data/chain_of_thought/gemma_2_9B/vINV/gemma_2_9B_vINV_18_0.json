This can be represented symbolically as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal.\"\n\n* **Conclusion:** If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal. This can be represented as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ, where \u00acP means \"the doll was not plastic\" and \u00acQ means \"the truck was not metal.\"\n\nNow, to determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.  \n\nNotice that the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order.  \n\nThe contrapositive of P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP.  \n\nIn this case, our premise is P \u2192 Q, and our conclusion is \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ, which is indeed the contrapositive of the premise.\n\nA key rule in logic is that a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they always have the same truth value. If one is true, the other must also be true.\n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and they are logically equivalent, the argument is **logically valid**. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
