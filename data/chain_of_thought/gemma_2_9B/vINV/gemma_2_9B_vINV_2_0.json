A contrapositive argument is a type of logical argument where the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion of the original statement and then reversing their order.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n* **Premise:** If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n* **Contrapositive:** If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nNotice that the conclusion of our argument is indeed the contrapositive of the premise.  \n\nA key principle in logic is that a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if one is true, the other must also be true.  \n\nTherefore, if the premise is true, then its contrapositive (the conclusion of our argument) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
