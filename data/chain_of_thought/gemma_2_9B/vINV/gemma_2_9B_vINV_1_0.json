The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the antecedent and the consequent, and then reversing their order.\n\nLogically, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are always equivalent. This means that if the premise is true, the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
