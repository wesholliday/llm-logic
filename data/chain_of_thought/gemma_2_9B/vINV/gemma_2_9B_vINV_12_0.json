            "content": "\n\nExplanation: \nLet's break down the argument and analyze its structure. \n\nThe premise states a conditional relationship: if Joe goes to the park, then Lucy goes to the zoo. This can be represented symbolically as P -> Q, where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nThe conclusion states the opposite conditional relationship: if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo. This can be represented as ~P -> ~Q, where ~P means \"Joe did not go to the table\" and ~Q means \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\"\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.  \n\nNotice that the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and reversing their order.  \n\nA key rule in logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they always have the same truth value.\n\nTherefore, since the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and they are logically equivalent, the argument is **logically valid**. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
