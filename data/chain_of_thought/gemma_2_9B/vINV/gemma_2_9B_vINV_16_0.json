In other words, if the premise is true, must the conclusion also be true?\n\nConsider the following:\n\n* **If the premise is true:**  This means that whenever the shirt is cotton, the pants are denim. \n* **What does this tell us about when the shirt is NOT cotton?**  The premise doesn't directly tell us anything about what happens when the shirt is not cotton. It only focuses on the case when the shirt IS cotton.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim. The conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
