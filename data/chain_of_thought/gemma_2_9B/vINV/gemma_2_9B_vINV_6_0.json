This can be represented symbolically as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q is \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\n* **Conclusion:** If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta. This can be represented as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ, where \u00acP means \"Sue did not choose pizza\" and \u00acQ means \"Bob did not choose pasta.\"\n\nNow, to determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.  \n\nConsider the truth values:\n\n* **Case 1:** If Sue chose pizza (P is true), then according to the premise, Bob chose pasta (Q is true). This aligns with both the premise and the conclusion.\n\n* **Case 2:** If Sue did not choose pizza (P is false), we don't have enough information from the premise to determine whether Bob chose pasta or not. The premise only tells us what happens *if* Sue chose pizza.\n\nSince the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premise in all cases, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
