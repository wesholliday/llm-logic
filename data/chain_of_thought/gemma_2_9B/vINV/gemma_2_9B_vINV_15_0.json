            "content": "\n\nExplanation: \nLet's break down the argument and analyze its structure. \n\nThe premise states a conditional relationship: if Sam takes a plane, then Erin takes a train. This can be represented symbolically as P -> Q, where P is \"Sam took a plane\" and Q is \"Erin took a train.\"\n\nThe conclusion states the opposite conditional relationship: if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train. This can be represented as ~P -> ~Q, where ~P means \"Sam did not take a plane\" and ~Q means \"Erin did not take a train.\"\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.  \n\nNotice that the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order.  \n\nA key rule in logic is that a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they always have the same truth value. If the premise is true, the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, since the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
