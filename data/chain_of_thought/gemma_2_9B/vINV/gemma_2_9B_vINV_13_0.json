This can be represented symbolically as:  P \u2192 Q (where P = \"the car was red\" and Q = \"the truck was blue\").\n\n* **Conclusion:** If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue. This can be represented symbolically as: \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ (where \u00acP = \"the car was not red\" and \u00acQ = \"the truck was not blue\").\n\nNow, to determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.  \n\nNotice that the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order.  \n\nIn this case:\n\n* **Premise:** P \u2192 Q\n* **Contrapositive:** \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\nA key rule in logic is that a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they always have the same truth value. If one is true, the other is also true. If one is false, the other is also false.\n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and they are logically equivalent, the argument is **logically valid**. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
