            "content": "\n\nExplanation: \nLet's break down the argument and analyze its structure. \n\nThe premise states a conditional relationship: if the dog is inside, then the cat must be outside. This can be represented symbolically as:\n\nP -> Q (where P = \"the dog was inside\" and Q = \"the cat was outside\")\n\nThe conclusion, however, states the opposite conditional relationship: if the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside. This can be represented as:\n\n\u00acP -> \u00acQ\n\nNotice that the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise.  \n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and reversing their order.  Importantly, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they always have the same truth value.\n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and contrapositives are logically equivalent, the argument is **logically valid**. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
