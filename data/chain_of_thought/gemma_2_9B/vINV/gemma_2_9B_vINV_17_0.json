This can be represented symbolically as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q is \"Kate ate salad\".\n\nThe conclusion states the opposite conditional relationship: if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad. This can be represented as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ, where \u00acP means \"Ben did not eat pasta\" and \u00acQ means \"Kate did not eat salad\".\n\nNow, to determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.  In other words, if the premise is true, must the conclusion also be true?\n\nConsider a scenario where the premise is true.  If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.  This doesn't automatically mean that if Ben *didn't* eat pasta, Kate *must* not have eaten salad.  There could be other reasons why Kate ate salad, even if Ben didn't eat pasta.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
