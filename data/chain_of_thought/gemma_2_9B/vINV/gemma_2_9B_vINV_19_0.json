We can use a truth table to help us visualize this.\n\n* **Constructing a Truth Table:**\n\nWe have two propositions:\n\n* P: Tom watched football\n* Q: Jen watched basketball\n\n| P | Q | P -> Q | ~P | ~Q | ~P -> ~Q |\n|---|---|-------|----|----|--------|\n| T | T |   T   | F | F |   T   |\n| T | F |   F   | F | T |   T   |\n| F | T |   T   | T | F |   F   |\n| F | F |   T   | T | T |   T   |\n\n* **Analyzing the Truth Table:**\n\nThe truth table shows all possible combinations of truth values for P and Q.  The column \"~P -> ~Q\" represents the conclusion of our argument.\n\nNotice that the conclusion (~P -> ~Q) is only false when P is false and Q is true. This corresponds to the third row of the truth table.\n\n* **Conclusion:**\n\nSince the conclusion is not always true when the premise (P -> Q) is true, the argument is **not logically valid**.\n\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
