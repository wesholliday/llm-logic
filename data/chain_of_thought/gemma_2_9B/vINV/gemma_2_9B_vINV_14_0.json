This can be represented symbolically as:\n\n* P \u2192 Q (where P = \"the bear is in the cave\" and Q = \"the wolf is in the den\")\n\nThe conclusion states the opposite conditional relationship: if the bear is not in the cave, then the wolf is not in the den. This can be represented as:\n\n* \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ (where \u00acP = \"the bear is not in the cave\" and \u00acQ = \"the wolf is not in the den\")\n\nNow, to determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.  \n\nNotice that the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and reversing their order.  \n\nA key rule in logic is that a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they always have the same truth value.\n\nSince the premise is logically equivalent to its contrapositive (the conclusion), the argument is **logically valid**.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
