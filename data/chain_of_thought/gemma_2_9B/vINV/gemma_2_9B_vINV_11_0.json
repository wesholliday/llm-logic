This can be represented symbolically as:\n\nP -> Q (where P = \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q = \"the muffins were blueberry\")\n\nThe conclusion states the opposite conditional relationship: if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry. This can be represented as:\n\n\u00acP -> \u00acQ\n\nNow, to determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.  \n\nA key concept here is the law of contrapositive. The law of contrapositive states that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. The contrapositive of P -> Q is \u00acQ -> \u00acP.\n\nNotice that our conclusion (\u00acP -> \u00acQ) is the contrapositive of the premise (P -> Q).  \n\nTherefore, if the premise is true, then its contrapositive (and consequently the conclusion) must also be true. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
