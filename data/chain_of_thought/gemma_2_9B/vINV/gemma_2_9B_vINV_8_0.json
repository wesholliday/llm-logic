The premise states a conditional relationship: if one event (vampire awake) happens, then another event (mummy awake) also happens. The conclusion, however, presents a different conditional relationship: if one event (vampire not awake) happens, then the other event (mummy not awake) also happens.\n\nTo determine logical validity, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.  \n\nConsider the truth values:\n\n* **Premise:** If P (vampire awake), then Q (mummy awake).\n* **Conclusion:** If not P (vampire not awake), then not Q (mummy not awake).\n\nNotice that the conclusion is essentially the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order.  \n\nLogically, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are always equivalent. This means that if the premise is true, the contrapositive (the conclusion in this case) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
