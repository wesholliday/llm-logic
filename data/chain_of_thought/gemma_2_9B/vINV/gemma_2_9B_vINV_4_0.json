The premise doesn't guarantee that if the alien *didn't* visit Mars, the robot *mustn't* have visited Jupiter.  It only tells us about the relationship when the alien *did* visit Mars.\n\nThink of it this way: the premise might be true, but it doesn't provide enough information to make the conclusion necessarily true.  \n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
