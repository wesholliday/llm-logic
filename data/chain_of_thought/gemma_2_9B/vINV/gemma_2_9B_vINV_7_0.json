This can be represented symbolically as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Alex finishes the race\" and Q is \"Chris finishes the race.\"\n\nThe conclusion states the opposite conditional relationship: If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race. This can be represented symbolically as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ, where \u00acP means \"Alex did not finish the race\" and \u00acQ means \"Chris did not finish the race.\"\n\nNow, to determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.  In other words, if the premise is true, must the conclusion also be true?\n\nNotice that the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order.  \n\nThe contrapositive of P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, they are logically equivalent. If the premise is true, the contrapositive (and therefore the conclusion) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
