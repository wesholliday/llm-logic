    "user_prompt": "Suppose a fantole, a dribban, and a snorpul have the best odds to win this season's Rizzle Cup. Oddsmakers believe it's most probable the fantole will capture the cup, followed by the dribban, while the snorpul is a heavy longshot. Since these are the only top contenders, if the dribban doesn\u2019t win the cup, then if the fantole doesn\u2019t win, the snorpul will win. Moreover, the fantole likely will win the cup and hence the dribban likely won't win. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantole doesn't win the Rizzle Cup, the snorpul will?",
