    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crinel, a nafiz, and a tomul are competing to be snarggle of next year's laggle team. The crinel is considered the frontrunner for snarggle, followed by the nafiz, while the tomul is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates, if the nafiz isn\u2019t named snarggle, then if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle. Moreover, the crinel likely will be named snarggle and hence the nafiz likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be?",

This tells us the order of likelihood for each candidate.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** If the nafiz isn't named snarggle, and the crinel isn't named snarggle, then the tomul will be named snarggle. This establishes a conditional relationship: if both the frontrunner and the second-most likely candidate fail, the long shot becomes the only option.\n\n3. **Premise 3:** The crinel is likely to be named snarggle, so the nafiz likely won't be. This strengthens the likelihood of the first part of the conditional relationship in Premise 2.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Does it follow that it is likely that, if the crinel isn't named snarggle, the tomul will be?\n\n   We need to analyze if the given premises logically lead to this conclusion.  Premise 3 suggests the crinel is more likely than not to be chosen. If that's the case, the scenario where the crinel *isn't* chosen becomes less likely.  \n\n   Since the conclusion hinges on the crinel *not* being chosen, and that scenario is less likely based on the information given, the conclusion itself becomes less likely.\n\n\n\nAnswer: \nno",
