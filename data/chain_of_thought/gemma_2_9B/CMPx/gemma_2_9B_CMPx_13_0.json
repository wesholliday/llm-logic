    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantug, a loperit, and a frallon are shortlisted for Blither of the Year. Industry watchers consider the fantug the front runner, followed by the loperit, while the frallon is a heavy underdog. Since these are the only products in contention, if the loperit doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the fantug doesn\u2019t win, the frallon will win. Moreover, the fantug likely will win the award and hence the loperit likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantug doesn't win Blither of the Year, the frallon will?",

This tells us the general order of likelihood of winning.\n* **Statement 2:** If loperit doesn't win, and fantug doesn't win, then frallon wins. This is a conditional statement, meaning it only holds true under those specific circumstances.\n* **Statement 3:** Fantug is likely to win, so loperit is likely to lose. This strengthens the idea that the fantug is the most probable winner.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion: \"It's likely that, if the fantug doesn't win, the frallon will.\"\n\nWe know from statement 2 that if both fantug and loperit lose, frallon wins. However, statement 3 tells us fantug is *likely* to win.  This means it's not guaranteed that fantug *won't* win.\n\nTherefore, even though statement 2 sets up a scenario where frallon wins if both others lose, the likelihood of fantug *not* winning is not high enough to confidently say it's likely frallon will win if that happens.\n\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
