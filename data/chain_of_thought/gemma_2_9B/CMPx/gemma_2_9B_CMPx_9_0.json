    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a vringel, a nastil, and a joncul are shortlisted for this year\u2019s Luggleton Prize. The vringel is regarded as the most likely winner, followed by the nastil, while the joncul is considered a significant underdog. Since these are the only finalists, if the nastil doesn\u2019t win the prize, then if the vringel doesn\u2019t win, the joncul will win. Moreover, the vringel likely will win the prize and hence the nastil likely won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the vringel doesn\u2019t win the prize, the joncul will?",

This is a conditional statement.\n* **Statement 3:** The vringel is likely to win, so the nastil is likely to lose.\n\nNow, we want to know if it's likely that if the vringel doesn't win, the joncul will.  \n\nNotice that Statement 2 sets up a scenario: if both the nastil and vringel lose, the joncul wins.  Statement 3 tells us it's likely the vringel will win, making it less likely the nastil will win.\n\nHowever,  we can't definitively say it's *likely* that if the vringel doesn't win, the joncul will.  While Statement 2 establishes the possibility, Statement 3 doesn't give us enough information to say it's probable.  There could be other factors at play, or the likelihood of the nastil losing might not be high enough to make the joncul winning a likely outcome.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
