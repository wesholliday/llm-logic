    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantole, a dribban, and a cruggit are the most downloaded fillip apps this month. Market watchers expect the fantole likely will retain the top spot in downloads, followed by the dribban, with the cruggit download rate significantly lower. These lead the downloads, so if the dribban isn\u2019t the most downloaded, then if the fantole isn\u2019t, the cruggit will be. Moreover, the fantole likely will lead downloads and hence the dribban likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fantole isn\u2019t the most downloaded, the cruggit will be?",

If fantole is likely to lead downloads, then dribban likely won't. But Premise 3 states dribban is likely to be second. This creates a logical inconsistency.\n\nBecause of this inconsistency, we cannot definitively conclude that if fantole isn't the most downloaded, then cruggit will be. \n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
