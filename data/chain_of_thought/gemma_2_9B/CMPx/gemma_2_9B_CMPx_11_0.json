    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trenist, a lanken, and a draloid are shortlisted for Drij of the Year. The trenist is considered the front runner, followed by the lanken, while the draloid is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates in contention, if the lanken doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the trenist doesn\u2019t win it, the draloid will win it. Moreover, the trenist likely will win the award and hence the lanken likely won\u2019t win it. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trenist doesn\u2019t win Drij of the Year, the draloid will?",

This tells us the order of likelihood of winning.\n* **Premise 2:** If the lanken doesn't win, and the trenist doesn't win, then the draloid will win. This is a conditional statement.\n* **Premise 3:** The trenist likely will win, so the lanken likely won't. This strengthens the idea that the trenist is the most probable winner.\n\nNow, we need to determine if the conclusion follows logically:\n\n* **Conclusion:** It's likely that if the trenist doesn't win, the draloid will.\n\nLet's analyze:\n\n* We know the trenist is likely to win, making the lanken unlikely to win.\n* If the trenist *doesn't* win, the lanken *can't* win (due to Premise 2).\n* Therefore, if the trenist doesn't win, the draloid *must* win.\n\nHowever, the question asks if it's *likely* the draloid will win if the trenist doesn't. While it's *certain* the draloid will win in that scenario,  \"likely\" implies a degree of probability.\n\nSince the draloid is a long shot, even if the trenist doesn't win, it's not necessarily *likely* they will win.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
