    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a vringlet, a crappen, and a strorvil are shortlisted for the Liggerton Award in bloffu this year. Bloffu critics regard the vringlet as the front runner, followed by the crappen, while the strorvil is a heavy underdog. Since these are the only finalists under consideration, if the crappen doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the vringlet doesn\u2019t win, the strorvil will win. Moreover, the vringlet likely will win the award and hence the crappen likely won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the vringlet doesn\u2019t win the Liggerton Award, the strorvil will?",

This is a conditional statement.\n* **Premise 3:** The vringlet is likely to win, so the crappen is likely to lose.\n\nNow, we need to determine if it follows logically that if the vringlet doesn't win, the strorvil is likely to win.\n\nNotice that Premise 2 sets up a scenario: if both the crappen and vringlet lose, the strorvil wins.  However, Premise 3 tells us the vringlet is likely to win.  \n\nThis means the scenario outlined in Premise 2 is less likely to occur.  \n\nTherefore, even though Premise 2 states that *if* the vringlet doesn't win and the crappen doesn't win, the strorvil will win, it doesn't necessarily follow that it is *likely* to happen given the information we have.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
