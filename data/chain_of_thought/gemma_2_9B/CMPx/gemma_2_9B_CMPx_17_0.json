    "user_prompt": "Suppose a flinker, a dringen, and a n\u00fcffen have the best projections to have a breakout season next year. Talent scouts believe it's highly probable the flinker will have a breakout season, followed closely by the dringen, while the n\u00fcffen is an outside shot. Since these are the only top prospects, if the dringen doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season. Moreover, scouts think the flinker will likely have a breakout season and hence the dringen likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will?",

While the first statement says the n\u00fcffen *would* have a breakout if both the flinker and dringen fail, the second statement suggests the flinker is more likely to succeed.\n\n\nAnswer: \nno",
