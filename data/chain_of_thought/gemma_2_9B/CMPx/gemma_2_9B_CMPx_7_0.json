    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crastin, a nivet, and a jomial are the top bispets this breeding season. Breeders expect the crastin likely will birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, with the jomial birthing many fewer. These lead in birthing, so if the nivet doesn\u2019t birth the most offspring, then if the crastin doesn\u2019t, the jomial will. Moreover, the crastin likely will lead births and hence the nivet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the crastin doesn\u2019t lead births, the jomial will?",

It says *if* the nivet doesn't lead (which is possible since Premise 3 says it's *likely* not to), *then* the jomial will.\n\nHowever, Premise 2 doesn't say *that* the jomial *will* lead if the crastin doesn't. It only says it will *if* the nivet also doesn't.\n\nTherefore, we can't definitively say it's *likely* the jomial will lead if the crastin doesn't. There's a possibility the nivet could lead instead.\n\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
