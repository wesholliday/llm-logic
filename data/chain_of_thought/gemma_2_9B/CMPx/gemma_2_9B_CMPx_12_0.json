    "user_prompt": "Suppose a stribben, a vanoon, and a jentapp are applying to rent a bondle. The owner thinks the stribben is the strongest applicant, followed by the vanoon, while the jentapp seems much less qualified to rent a bondle. Since these are the only applicants, if the vanoon isn\u2019t selected, then if the stribben isn\u2019t selected, the jentapp will be selected. Moreover, the stribben likely will be chosen and hence the vanoon likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the stribben isn\u2019t selected to rent the bondle, the jentapp will be?",

However, the information given doesn't directly establish this connection. \n\n* Just because the stribben is likely chosen doesn't mean it's *certain*. There's still a possibility the stribben is not chosen.\n*  Even if the stribben isn't chosen, the vanoon might still be chosen. The conditional statement only applies if BOTH the stribben and vanoon are *not* chosen.\n\n\nAnswer: \nno",
