This means that for something to be a floob, it *must* be zibbled by glorp.  \n\nThe new statement \"The floob must be zibble by glorp or wozzle flimble\" introduces an additional possibility. It suggests that a floob could be zibbled by glorp *or* wozzle flimble.\n\nSince the original statement only specifies that zibbling by glorp is necessary, it doesn't rule out the possibility of other conditions.  Therefore, we can't definitively say that a floob *must* be zibbled by glorp *or* wozzle flimble.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
