The new statement proposes that the floob *must* be snizzle a quank *or* wobble. This introduces an additional possibility.  \n\nSince the original statement already establishes a necessary condition, adding an \"or\"  doesn't necessarily make the new statement true. It's possible for the floob to be snizzle a quank and not wobble.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
