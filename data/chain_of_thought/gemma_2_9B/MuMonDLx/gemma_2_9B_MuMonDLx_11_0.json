It states that \"wobble\" is a required characteristic or state of \"fizzle\".  \n\nThe new statement \"The fizzle must be wobble or shimble\" introduces an additional possibility, \"shimble\".  \n\nSince the original statement doesn't exclude the possibility of \"shimble\", we can't definitively say that \"fizzle\" *must* be both \"wobble\" and \"shimble\". It's possible that \"fizzle\" could be \"wobble\" alone, or it could be \"shimble\" alone.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
