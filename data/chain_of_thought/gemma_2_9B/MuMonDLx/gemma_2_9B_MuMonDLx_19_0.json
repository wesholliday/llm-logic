This means there are no other possibilities for the quibble's identity.  \n\nThe proposed statement \"The quibble must be froodle quank or frazzle fribble\" introduces an additional possibility,  \"frazzle fribble\".  Since the original statement excluded all other possibilities, adding a new one contradicts the original meaning.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
