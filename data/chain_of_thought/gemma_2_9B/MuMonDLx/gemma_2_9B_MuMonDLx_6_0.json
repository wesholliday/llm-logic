This means that if something is a grooble, it *must* be plonk wobble.  \n\nThe new statement \"The grooble must be plonk wobble or flonk wozzle bimboozle\" introduces an additional possibility. It suggests that a grooble could be either plonk wobble *or* flonk wozzle bimboozle.\n\nSince the original statement only guarantees plonk wobble, we can't definitively say that a grooble *must* also be flonk wozzle bimboozle. It's possible for a grooble to be only plonk wobble.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
