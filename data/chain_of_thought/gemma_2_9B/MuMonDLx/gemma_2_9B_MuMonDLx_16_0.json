The new statement proposes an addition, \"or flibbit floob\", which introduces an alternative.  Since the original statement was absolute, adding an \"or\" implies a change in meaning, suggesting that the frazzle could be either crunk zump *or* flibbit floob.  Therefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the original.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
