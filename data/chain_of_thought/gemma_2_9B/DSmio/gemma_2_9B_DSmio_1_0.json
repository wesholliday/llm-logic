It leaves open the possibility that Fido *could* be in the garden.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\"** This statement presents two mutually exclusive options: Fido is inside, or Fido is in the garden.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n* If Fido were in the garden, Statement 1 wouldn't be a possibility (since it says Fido *might not* be in the garden).\n\n* Therefore, the only option that satisfies both statements is that Fido must be inside.\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
