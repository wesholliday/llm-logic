It doesn't definitively say it's *not* on the nightstand, just that it's possible.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\" This statement presents two exclusive possibilities: the notebook is in the drawer, or it's on the nightstand.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship:\n\n* If the notebook were on the nightstand, Statement 1 wouldn't be true (because it says it *might not* be there). \n\n* Therefore, since Statement 1 is possible, the notebook cannot be on the nightstand.\n\n* This leaves us with the only remaining possibility from Statement 2: the notebook must be in the drawer.\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
