It doesn't definitively say it's not on the desk, just that it's possible.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk.\" This presents two possibilities: the pen is in the bag, or the pen is on the desk.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n* If the pen were on my desk, Statement 1 wouldn't be true (because it says the pen *might not* be on the desk).\n\n* Since Statement 1 is true, the pen cannot be on my desk.\n\n* Therefore, the only remaining possibility from Statement 2 is that the pen must be in my bag. \n\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
