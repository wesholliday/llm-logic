It leaves open the possibility that the jacket *is* hanging in the closet, but also the possibility that it's somewhere else.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet.\" This statement presents two exclusive options: the jacket is on the chair, or it's in the closet.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n* If the jacket *were* hanging in the closet, Statement 2 would be true.\n* However, Statement 1 says the jacket *might not* be hanging in the closet.\n\nThis means there's a chance the jacket is *not* in the closet.  Since Statement 2 says the only other option is the jacket being on the chair, we can infer that the jacket must be draped over the chair. \n\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
