It leaves room for the milk to be in the fridge.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\" This statement presents two exclusive options: the milk is on the counter, or it's in the fridge.\n\nNow, let's analyze the combined information:\n\nIf we assume the milk is in the fridge, Statement 1 (\"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\") would be true (it's possible it's not chilling). However, this contradicts Statement 2, which says the milk *must* be in the fridge if it's not on the counter.\n\nTherefore, the only way to satisfy both statements is if the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
