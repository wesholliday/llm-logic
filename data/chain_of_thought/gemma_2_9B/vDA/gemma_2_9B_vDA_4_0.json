Here's why:\n\n* **Modus Tollens Structure:**  Modus Tollens has the following form:\n\n    1. If P, then Q.\n    2. Not P.\n    3. Therefore, not Q.\n\n* **Applying it to our example:**\n\n    1. If the alien visited Mars (P), then the robot visited Jupiter (Q).\n    2. The alien did not visit Mars (not P).\n    3. Therefore, the robot did not visit Jupiter (not Q).\n\nSince the argument follows the structure of a valid Modus Tollens, it is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
