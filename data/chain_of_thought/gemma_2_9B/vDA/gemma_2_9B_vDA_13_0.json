This is a conditional statement, meaning it proposes a relationship where one event (car being red) implies another (truck being blue).\n\n* **Premise 2:** The car was not red. This contradicts the \"if\" part of the first premise.\n\n* **Conclusion:** The truck was not blue. This is the statement we want to determine if it logically follows from the premises.\n\nNow, consider the possible scenarios:\n\n* **Scenario 1:** If the car *was* red, then according to Premise 1, the truck *would* be blue. But Premise 2 tells us the car was not red, so this scenario is ruled out.\n\n* **Scenario 2:** If the car was not red, we cannot definitively say anything about the color of the truck based on the given premises. Premise 1 only establishes a connection when the car *is* red.\n\nSince the argument doesn't provide enough information to guarantee the conclusion (the truck being not blue), it is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
