Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* Premise 1: If P, then Q.\n* Premise 2: Not Q.\n* Conclusion: Not P.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The book was written by James.\n* Q: The book is a mystery novel.\n\nThe argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens because:\n\n* Premise 1 states that if the book was written by James (P), then it is a mystery novel (Q).\n* Premise 2 states that the book is not a mystery novel (not Q).\n* Conclusion: Therefore, the book was not written by James (not P).\n\nSince Modus Tollens is a valid argument form, this argument is also logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
