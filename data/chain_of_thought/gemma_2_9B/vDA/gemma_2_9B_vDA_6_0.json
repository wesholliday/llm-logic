This is a conditional statement, meaning it asserts that if one event (Sue choosing pizza) happens, then another event (Bob choosing pasta) must also happen.\n\n* **Premise 2:** Sue did not choose pizza. This is a statement of fact, directly contradicting the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of our conditional statement.\n\n* **Conclusion:** Bob did not choose pasta. This is what we are trying to determine.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion.  Premise 1 tells us that if Sue chose pizza, Bob would choose pasta. However, Premise 2 tells us that Sue *didn't* choose pizza.  This means the condition in Premise 1 is not met.  Since the condition isn't met, we cannot conclude anything about Bob's choice.\n\nThe argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.  \n\nAnswer: no \n",
