This is a conditional statement, meaning it proposes a relationship where one event (apple being red) implies another (banana being yellow).\n\n* **Premise 2:** The apple was not red. This contradicts the \"if\" part of the first premise.\n\n* **Conclusion:** The banana was not yellow. This is the conclusion we are trying to determine if it logically follows from the premises.\n\nNow, consider the structure.  The argument uses a form of logical reasoning called *modus tollens*. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know the consequent (Q) is false, then we can conclude that the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The apple was red\n* Q: The banana was yellow\n\nPremise 2 tells us that P (the apple being red) is false.  Since we have a valid form of reasoning (modus tollens), we cannot conclude that Q (the banana being yellow) is also false.  The argument structure doesn't support this conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
