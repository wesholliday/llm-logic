This is a conditional statement, meaning it proposes a relationship where one event (doll being plastic) implies another (truck being metal).\n\n* **Premise 2:** The doll was not plastic. This contradicts the \"if\" part of the first premise.\n\n* **Conclusion:** The truck was not metal. This is the statement we want to determine if it logically follows from the premises.\n\nNow, consider the implications:\n\nIf the first premise were true, and the doll *were* plastic, then the truck *must* be metal. However, we are told the doll *was not* plastic.  This means the first premise doesn't directly apply.  Since the first premise doesn't directly apply, we can't conclude anything about the metal status of the truck.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
