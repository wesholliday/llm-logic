Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down our example:\n\n* P: The bear was in the cave.\n* Q: The wolf was in the den.\n\nThe argument follows the Modus Tollens structure:\n\n1. If the bear was in the cave (P), then the wolf was in the den (Q).\n2. The bear was not in the cave (not P).\n3. Therefore, the wolf was not in the den (not Q).\n\nSince Modus Tollens is a valid argument form, and our example follows its structure, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
