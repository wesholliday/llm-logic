Here's why:\n\n* **Modus Tollens Structure:**  Modus Tollens has the following form:\n\n    1. If P, then Q.\n    2. Not P.\n    3. Therefore, not Q.\n\n* **Applying it to our example:**\n\n    1. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis (P -> Q)\n    2. Jeff did not play basketball (Not P)\n    3. Therefore, Amy did not play tennis (Not Q)\n\nSince the argument follows the structure of a valid argument form, and the premises are assumed to be true, the conclusion must also be true. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
