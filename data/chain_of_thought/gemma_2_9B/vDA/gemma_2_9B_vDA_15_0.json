Here's why:\n\n* **Modus Tollens Structure:**  Modus Tollens has the following form:\n\n    1. If P, then Q.\n    2. Not P.\n    3. Therefore, not Q.\n\n* **Applying it to our example:**\n\n    1. If Sam took a plane (P), then Erin took a train (Q).\n    2. Sam did not take a plane (not P).\n    3. Therefore, Erin did not take a train (not Q).\n\nSince the argument follows the structure of a valid Modus Tollens, it is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
