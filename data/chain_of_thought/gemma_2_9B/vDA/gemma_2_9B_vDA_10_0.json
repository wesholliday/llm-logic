This is a conditional statement, meaning it asserts that if one event (dog inside) happens, then another event (cat outside) must also happen.\n\n* **Premise 2:** The dog was not inside. This is a statement of fact, negating the first part of the conditional statement.\n\n* **Conclusion:** The cat was not outside. This is the claim we want to see if the premises support.\n\nNow, let's consider the logic.  Premise 1 tells us that if the dog *were* inside, the cat *would* be outside. However, Premise 2 tells us the dog *wasn't* inside.  This means the conditional statement in Premise 1 doesn't apply.  We can't conclude anything about the cat's location based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
