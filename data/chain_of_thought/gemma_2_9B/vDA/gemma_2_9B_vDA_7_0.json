Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P = Alex finished the race\n* Q = Chris finished the race\n\nThe argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens because:\n\n1. We are given that if Alex finished the race (P), then Chris finished the race (Q).\n2. We are also given that Alex did not finish the race (not P).\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that Chris did not finish the race (not Q).\n\nSince Modus Tollens is a valid argument form, this argument is also logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
