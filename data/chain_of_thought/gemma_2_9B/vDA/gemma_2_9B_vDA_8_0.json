Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P = The vampire was awake\n* Q = The mummy was awake\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** If the vampire was awake (P), then the mummy was awake (Q).\n2. **Premise 2:** The vampire was not awake (not P).\n3. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the mummy was not awake (not Q).\n\nSince the argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens, and the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
