Modus Tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know the consequent (Q) is false, then we can conclude that the antecedent (P) is also false.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The car was red\n* Q: The truck was blue\n\nWe are given:\n\n* If P, then Q: If the car was red, then the truck was blue\n* Not P: The car was not red\n\nSince we know the car was not red (Not P), and we have the conditional statement, we can apply Modus Tollens to conclude that the truck was not blue (Not Q).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
