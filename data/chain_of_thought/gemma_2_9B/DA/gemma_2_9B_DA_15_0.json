It means that if the first part (Sam taking a plane) is true, then the second part (Erin taking a train) must also be true.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** Sam did not take a plane. This is a statement of fact, directly contradicting the \"if\" part of our conditional statement.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**  Since the \"if\" part of the conditional statement is false (Sam didn't take a plane), the \"then\" part (Erin taking a train) doesn't have to be true.  The conditional statement doesn't tell us anything about what happens when the \"if\" part is false.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
