It means that if the first part (the doll being plastic) is true, then the second part (the truck being metal) must also be true.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The doll was not plastic.\" This is a statement that directly contradicts the first part of the conditional statement.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** We want to know if we can infer \"The truck was not metal.\"  Since the first part of the conditional statement is false (the doll wasn't plastic), the entire conditional statement doesn't hold.  This means we can't conclude anything for sure about the metal status of the truck. The truth of the conclusion is independent of the truth of the premises.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
