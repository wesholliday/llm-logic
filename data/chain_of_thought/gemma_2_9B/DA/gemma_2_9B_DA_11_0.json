Modus Tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know the consequent (Q) is false, then we can conclude that the antecedent (P) is also false.\n\nLet's break down our statements:\n\n* **P:** The cake was chocolate.\n* **Q:** The muffins were blueberry.\n\nWe are given:\n\n* **Conditional statement:** If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n* **Negation of the consequent:** The cake was not chocolate.\n\nApplying Modus Tollens:\n\nSince the cake was not chocolate (negation of P), we can conclude that the muffins were not blueberry (negation of Q).\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
