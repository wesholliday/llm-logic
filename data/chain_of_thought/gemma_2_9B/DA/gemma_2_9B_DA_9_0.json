            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nHere's how we can break down the logic:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This is a conditional statement.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This is a factual statement.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This is what we want to determine.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship between the premises and the conclusion:\n\n* The first premise tells us something *would* happen (Mark buying the blue shirt) *if* a specific condition were met (Lisa buying the red shirt).\n* The second premise tells us that the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) *did not* happen.\n\nSince the condition in the first premise was not met, the consequence (Mark buying the blue shirt) doesn't necessarily have to follow.  The first premise doesn't guarantee that Mark *wouldn't* buy the blue shirt, just that it wouldn't happen *if* Lisa had bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
