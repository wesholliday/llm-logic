            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nThis is a classic example of a logical argument involving conditional statements. Let's break it down:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This is a conditional statement, often written as \"p \u2192 q\", where 'p' is Tom watching football and 'q' is Jen watching basketball.\n\n* **Premise 2:** Tom did not watch football. This is a statement about the truth value of 'p' (Tom watching football), which is false in this case.\n\n* **Conclusion:** We want to determine if we can infer that Jen did not watch basketball, which is the negation of 'q'.\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of logic:\n\nThe structure of our argument resembles a **modus tollens** pattern. Modus tollens is a valid argument form that states:\n\nIf p \u2192 q is true, and p is false, then q must be false.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* p \u2192 q is true (Premise 1)\n* p is false (Premise 2)\n\nTherefore, according to modus tollens, q must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
