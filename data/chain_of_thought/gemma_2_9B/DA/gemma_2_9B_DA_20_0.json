Modus Tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know the consequent (Q) is false, then we can conclude that the antecedent (P) is also false.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The apple was red\n* Q: The banana was yellow\n\nWe are given:\n\n* If P, then Q (If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow)\n* Not Q (The apple was not red)\n\nSince we know the antecedent (the apple being red) is false, we can apply Modus Tollens to conclude that the consequent (the banana being yellow) is also false.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n\n\n",
