Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that states:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The vampire was awake.\n* Q: The mummy was awake.\n\nWe are given:\n\n* If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (If P, then Q).\n* The vampire was not awake (Not P).\n\nTherefore, according to Modus Tollens, we can conclude:\n\n* The mummy was not awake (Not Q).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
