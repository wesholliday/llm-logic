It means that if the first part (antecedent) is true, then the second part (consequent) must also be true.\n    * \"Joe did not go to the park\" is a statement that directly contradicts the antecedent of our first statement.\n\n* **Applying Logic:** Since the antecedent (\"Joe went to the park\") is false in our scenario, the entire conditional statement becomes irrelevant.  The truth or falsity of the consequent (\"Lucy went to the zoo\") doesn't depend on the antecedent in this case.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
