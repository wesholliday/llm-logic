This means there is a possibility that the quibble is crunk quorple, but it's not certain.  The second statement adds \"and flonk wumble\" to the original.  Adding something to an already uncertain statement doesn't necessarily make the original statement more certain.  It's possible the quibble is crunk quorple, and it's also possible it's flonk wumble, or both, or neither.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
