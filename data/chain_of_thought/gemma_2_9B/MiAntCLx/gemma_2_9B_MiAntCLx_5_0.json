The second statement \"The wobble might be wump bimboozle and wump for\" adds the condition that the wobble must also be wump for.  \n\nSince the first statement doesn't rule out the possibility of the wobble being wump for, the second statement is not necessarily a contradiction. It's possible for the wobble to be both wump bimboozle and wump for.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n\n\n",
