This means it's possible, but not certain. The second statement adds an additional condition: the flimble *might* also be blimp quank.  \n\nSince the first statement doesn't say anything about the flimble being blimp quank, we can't infer that it must also be blimp quank. It's possible for the flimble to be grazzled by glorp without also being blimp quank.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
