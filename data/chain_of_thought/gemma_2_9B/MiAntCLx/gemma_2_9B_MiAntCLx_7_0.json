It doesn't say anything about the grooble being anything else.\n\nThe second statement, \"The grooble might be wumble and snizzle flibbit gribble,\"  means there's a possibility the grooble is *both* a wumble and has the additional qualities of snizzle flibbit gribble.\n\nSince the first statement doesn't rule out the possibility of the grooble having other qualities, the second statement is not necessarily implied by the first. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
