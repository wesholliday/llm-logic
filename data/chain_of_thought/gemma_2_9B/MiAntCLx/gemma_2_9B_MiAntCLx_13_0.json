It doesn't say anything about the grooble also being in a place called \"wobble zooble.\"\n\nThe second statement, \"The grooble might be in shimble and wobble zooble,\"  states that the grooble has a possibility of being in both shimble and wobble zooble.\n\nSince the first statement doesn't rule out the possibility of the grooble being in wobble zooble, it's possible, but not guaranteed.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
