It doesn't explicitly state or exclude the presence of anything else, like \"flump shimble.\"\n\nThe second statement, \"The zazzle might be in the quibble and flump shimble,\" introduces an additional element, \"flump shimble.\"  \n\nSince the first statement doesn't provide any information about \"flump shimble,\" we cannot logically infer that it is also involved. The first statement only focuses on the potential relationship between \"zazzle\" and \"quibble.\"\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
