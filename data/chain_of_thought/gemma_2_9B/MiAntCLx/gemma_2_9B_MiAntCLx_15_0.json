This statement doesn't say anything about the quork being anything else besides \"wobble flonk wobble\".  The new statement adds \"and wumble a snizzle\" which is not mentioned in the original statement.  Therefore, we cannot infer that the quork might be both \"wobble flonk wobble\" and \"wumble a snizzle\".\n\nAnswer: no \n",
