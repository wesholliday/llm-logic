The question asks if we can infer that the zazzle must be \"zibber or wobble crunk zibber\".  \n\nThis is a bit of a trick question.  The original statement is very specific, and doesn't leave room for the zazzle to be just \"zibber\".  It has to be the specific combination of \"wobble crunk zibber\".\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
