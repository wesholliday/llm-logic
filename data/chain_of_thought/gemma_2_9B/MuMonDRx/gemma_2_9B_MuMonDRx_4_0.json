The new statement says the grazzle *must be* quimble or blimple at zibber fizzle. This is saying the grazzle has to have one of those two qualities.  \n\nThe original statement doesn't say anything about the grazzle needing to be quimble. It only says it must blimple.  Therefore, we can't infer that the grazzle must be quimble or blimple.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
