The cookies can be in one place or the other, but not both.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry.\" This statement directly contradicts one of the options presented in the disjunction.\n\nSince the cookies can't be in both places, and we know they're not in the pantry, the only remaining possibility is that they must be in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
