It suggests that there's a chance the flob was *not* skizzled.  \n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled\" is a statement of necessity. It asserts that it's not a requirement or certainty that the flob was skizzled.\n\nSince the original statement allows for the possibility of the flob *not* being skizzled, it logically follows that it's not a necessity for the flob to have been skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
