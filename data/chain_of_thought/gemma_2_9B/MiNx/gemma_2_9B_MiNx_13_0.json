It suggests that there's a chance the glip was not slogged, but it doesn't definitively say it wasn't.  \n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the glip must have been slogged\" is a statement of necessity. It's saying that it's not a requirement or obligation that the glip was slogged.\n\nSince the original statement allows for the possibility of the glip *not* being slogged, it logically follows that it's not necessary for the glip to have been slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
