It suggests that there's a chance the shank wasn't plooked, but it doesn't definitively say it wasn't.  \n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the shank must have been plooked\" is a stronger statement. It asserts that it's impossible for the shank to have been plooked.\n\nSince the original statement only allows for the possibility that the shank wasn't plooked, it doesn't go far enough to say it's impossible that it was plooked. \n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
