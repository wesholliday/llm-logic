It suggests that there's a chance the zinger was not fraggled.  \n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the zinger must have been fraggled\" is a statement of necessity. It asserts that it's not a requirement or certainty that the zinger was fraggled.\n\nSince the original statement allows for the possibility of the zinger *not* being fraggled, it logically follows that it's not necessary for the zinger to have been fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
