It suggests that there's a chance the smonk was not vreebled, but it doesn't definitively say it wasn't.  \n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled\" is a statement of necessity. It asserts that it's impossible for the smonk to have been vreebled.\n\nSince the original statement only allows for the possibility of the smonk not being vreebled, it doesn't go as far as to say it's impossible for the smonk to have been vreebled. \n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
