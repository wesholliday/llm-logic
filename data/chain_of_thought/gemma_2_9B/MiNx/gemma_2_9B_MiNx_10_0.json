It doesn't definitively say it wasn't sproinged, just that it's a possibility.\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the wug must have been sproinged\" means that it's not a certainty that the wug *was* sproinged.\n\nSince the original statement allows for the possibility of the wug *not* being sproinged, it logically follows that it's not a certainty that the wug *must* have been sproinged.\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
