It suggests that there's a chance the dreb was not vroombed.  \n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the dreb must have been vroombed\" is a statement of necessity. It asserts that it's not a requirement or certainty that the dreb was vroombed.\n\nSince the original statement allows for the possibility of the dreb *not* being vroombed, it logically follows that it's not necessary for the dreb to have been vroombed.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
