            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nThis is a classic example of a logical argument involving conditional statements and negation. Here's how to break it down:\n\n* **Understanding the Statements:**\n\n    *  \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement. It has a hypothesis (the car was red) and a conclusion (the truck was blue).  \n    * \"The truck was not blue\" is a negation of the conclusion of the conditional statement.\n\n* **Applying Logic:**\n\n    We can use a rule of logic called *modus tollens* to analyze this. *Modus tollens* states that if we have a conditional statement and the negation of its conclusion, we can infer the negation of the hypothesis.\n\n    * **Modus Tollens:**\n        * If P, then Q.\n        * Not Q.\n        * Therefore, not P.\n\n* **Applying to Our Example:**\n\n    * P: The car was red.\n    * Q: The truck was blue.\n\n    * We are given:\n        * If P, then Q.\n        * Not Q.\n\n    * Therefore, according to *modus tollens*, we can conclude:\n        * Not P.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
