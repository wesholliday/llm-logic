            "content": "\n\nExplanation: \nThis is a classic example of a logical argument involving conditional statements and negation. \n\nLet's break it down:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. (This is a conditional statement, often written as \"p -> q\")\n* **Premise 2:** Lucy did not go to the zoo. (This is a negation of the consequent, \"not q\")\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"Joe did not go to the park\" (not p).\n\nThe key here is to understand the structure of conditional statements and how negation works.  The first premise tells us that *if* Joe went to the park, *then* Lucy would have gone to the zoo.  The second premise tells us that Lucy *did not* go to the zoo.\n\nSince the second premise contradicts the consequent of the first premise, we can use a rule of logic called *modus tollens* to reach our conclusion. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (p -> q) and the negation of the consequent (not q), then we can infer the negation of the antecedent (not p).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
