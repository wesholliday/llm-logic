It means that if the first part (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the second part (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\n* **Premise 2:** Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This is a statement of fact.\n\n* **Conclusion:** We want to know if we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nNow, let's analyze how the premises relate to the conclusion:\n\nSince we know Mark did not buy the blue shirt, and the first premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark *would* have bought the blue shirt, it follows that Lisa must not have bought the red shirt.  If she had, Mark would have had to buy the blue shirt, which we know is not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
