Modus Tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know the consequent (Q) is false, we can conclude that the antecedent (P) is also false.\n\nLet's break down the statements:\n\n* **P:** Ben ate pasta\n* **Q:** Kate ate the salad\n\n* **Statement 1:** If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad (If P, then Q)\n* **Statement 2:** Kate did not eat the salad (\u00acQ)\n\nSince we know Kate did not eat the salad (\u00acQ), and we have the conditional statement If P, then Q, Modus Tollens allows us to conclude that Ben did not eat pasta (\u00acP).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
