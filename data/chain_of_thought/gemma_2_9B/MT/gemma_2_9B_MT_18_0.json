            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nWe can use a process of deduction to determine the answer. \n\n1. **Identify the premises:**\n    * Premise 1: If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n    * Premise 2: The truck was not metal.\n\n2. **Analyze the relationship:** Premise 1 presents a conditional statement (if P, then Q), where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal.\"\n\n3. **Apply Modus Tollens:** Since the conclusion of the conditional statement (the truck being metal) is negated in Premise 2, we can apply the rule of inference called Modus Tollens. Modus Tollens states that if we have a conditional statement and the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**  Therefore, because the truck was not metal (the consequent is false), we can infer that the doll was not plastic (the antecedent is false).\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
