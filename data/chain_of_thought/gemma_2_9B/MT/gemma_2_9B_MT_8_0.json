Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that states:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down the given statements:\n\n1. **If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.** (P -> Q)\n2. **The mummy was not awake.** (Not Q)\n\nWe want to determine if we can conclude:\n\n3. **The vampire was not awake.** (Not P)\n\nAccording to Modus Tollens, if the premises (statements 1 and 2) are true, then the conclusion (statement 3) must also be true.  \n\nSince the mummy was not awake (premise 2), and we know that if the vampire was awake, the mummy would have been awake (premise 1), it logically follows that the vampire must not have been awake.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
