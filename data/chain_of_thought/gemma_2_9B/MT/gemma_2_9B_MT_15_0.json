It means that if the first part (Sam taking a plane) is true, then the second part (Erin taking a train) must also be true.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** Erin did not take a train. This is a statement of fact.\n\n3. **Inference:** We want to know if we can conclude that Sam did not take a plane.\n\n4. **Applying Logic:**  Since we know Erin did not take a train, and the first premise states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin *would* have taken a train, we can conclude that Sam must not have taken a plane.  This is an example of *modus tollens*, a valid argument form in logic.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
