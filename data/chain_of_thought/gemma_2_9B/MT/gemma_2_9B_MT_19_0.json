Modus Tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know the consequent (Q) is false, we can conclude that the antecedent (P) is also false.\n\nLet's break down the statements:\n\n* **P:** Tom watched football\n* **Q:** Jen watched basketball\n\n* **Statement 1:** If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball (If P, then Q)\n* **Statement 2:** Jen did not watch basketball (\u00acQ)\n\nSince we know Q is false (Jen did not watch basketball), Modus Tollens allows us to conclude that P must also be false (Tom did not watch football).\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
