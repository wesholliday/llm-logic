Modus tollens is a valid argument form that states:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down our statements:\n\n* P: The shirt was cotton.\n* Q: The pants were denim.\n\nWe are given:\n\n* If the shirt was cotton (P), then the pants were denim (Q).\n* The pants were not denim (not Q).\n\nSince the second statement contradicts the consequent (Q) of our conditional statement, we can apply modus tollens to conclude that the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n\n\n",
