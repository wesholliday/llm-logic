Here, P is \"Alex finished the race\" and Q is \"Chris finished the race\".\n\n* **Premise 2:** \"Chris did not finish the race.\" This is the negation of Q.\n\n* **Conclusion:** \"Alex did not finish the race.\" This is the negation of P.\n\nNow, we can use a truth table or a logical reasoning approach to see if the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\n**Logical Reasoning:**\n\nSince we know Chris did not finish the race (Q is false), and the first premise states that if Alex finished the race (P), then Chris would have finished (Q), it logically follows that Alex must not have finished the race (P must be false).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
