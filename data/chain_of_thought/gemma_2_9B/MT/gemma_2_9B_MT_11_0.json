If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The cake was chocolate.\n* Q: The muffins were blueberry.\n\nWe are given:\n\n* Premise 1: If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n* Premise 2: The muffins were not blueberry.\n\nFollowing the structure of Modus Tollens, since the muffins were not blueberry (not Q), we can conclude that the cake was not chocolate (not P).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
