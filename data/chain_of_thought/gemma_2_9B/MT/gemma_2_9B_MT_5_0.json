            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nThis is a classic example of a logical argument called Modus Tollens. Modus Tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know the consequent (Q) is false, we can conclude that the antecedent (P) is also false.\n\nLet's break down the statements:\n\n* **P:** Jeff played basketball\n* **Q:** Amy played tennis\n\n* **Statement 1:** If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis (If P, then Q)\n* **Statement 2:** Amy did not play tennis (\u00acQ)\n\nSince we know Amy did not play tennis (\u00acQ), Modus Tollens allows us to conclude that Jeff did not play basketball (\u00acP).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
