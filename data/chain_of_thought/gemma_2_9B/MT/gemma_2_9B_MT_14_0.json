Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The bear was in the cave.\n* Q: The wolf was in the den.\n\nWe are given:\n\n* If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. (P -> Q)\n* The wolf was not in the den. (Not Q)\n\nTherefore, according to Modus Tollens, we can conclude:\n\n* The bear was not in the cave. (Not P)\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
