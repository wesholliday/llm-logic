This establishes a conditional relationship.\n\n* **Scenario:** We're given a new situation: the bill is paid, but the check bounces.\n\n* **Analysis:**  The original premise only guarantees services will continue *if* the bill is paid. It doesn't address what happens if the payment method fails *after* the initial payment.  A bounced check means the payment wasn't actually successful.\n\n* **Conclusion:**  We can't definitively say the services will continue. The premise doesn't cover this specific scenario.\n\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
