In this case, P is \"we go to the concert\" and Q is \"we'll have a good time\".  \n\nThe new scenario introduces a third element, \"a bomb goes off\". This new element doesn't fit into the original conditional statement.  \n\nThe original statement doesn't tell us anything about what happens if something else occurs alongside going to the concert. It only tells us about the relationship between going to the concert and having a good time.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that we'll have a good time if a bomb goes off, even if we go to the concert.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
