This tells us that striking a match is a necessary condition for it to light.\n\n* **New Situation:** We're now considering a match that has been soaked in water.  \n\n* **Reasoning:**  Soaking a match in water would likely make it difficult or impossible to light, even if struck. Water can extinguish flames and disrupt the chemical reaction needed for combustion.\n\n* **Conclusion:**  The original premise only states that striking is *sufficient* to make a match light, not that it's *always* sufficient.  The soaked match introduces a new factor that could prevent it from lighting, even if struck.\n\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
