This is our given rule.\n* **New Situation:** We're told the oven is on AND the pilot light is out.\n\n* **Question:** Does the new situation still lead to the conclusion that the kitchen is warm?\n\nThe key here is to think about whether the pilot light being out *changes* the relationship between the oven being on and the kitchen being warm.  \n\nThe pilot light's status doesn't directly affect whether the oven heats the kitchen.  If the oven is on, it will generate heat regardless of whether the pilot light is lit.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
