If something \"must be\" at a certain location, it means it is absolutely necessary for it to be there.  \n\nThe original statement says the quorple \"must be at snork gribble\" and \"must be in the wibble plonk.\"  These are two separate requirements.  \n\nTo satisfy both requirements, the quorple would need to be at snork gribble *and* in the wibble plonk.  \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
