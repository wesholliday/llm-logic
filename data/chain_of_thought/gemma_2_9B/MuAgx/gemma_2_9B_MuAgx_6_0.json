This means the wobble has two requirements: it must be wumble fizzle and it must frazzle at wozzle zump.  The second part of the question asks if we can infer \"The wobble must be wumble fizzle and frazzle at wozzle zump\". This statement combines both requirements into one. Since the original statement explicitly states both requirements, we can definitely infer the combined statement. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
