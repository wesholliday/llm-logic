This implies that the zump has two necessary qualities: it must be zibber fizzle and it must be quork for.  The second statement asks if we can infer \"The zump must be zibber fizzle and quork for\". This is a shorter version of the original statement, removing the explicit \"it must be\".  \n\nSince the original statement already establishes that both qualities are necessary, removing the \"it must be\" doesn't change the meaning.  \n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
