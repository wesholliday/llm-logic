There's no other option.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\" This means there's a possibility the cookies are *not* hidden in the pantry.\n\nNow, let's combine the information:\n\nSince the cookies must be in either the jar or the pantry, and we know they don't *have* to be in the pantry, the only remaining possibility is that they must be in the jar. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
