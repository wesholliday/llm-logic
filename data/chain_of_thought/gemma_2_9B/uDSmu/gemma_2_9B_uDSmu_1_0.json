This is a disjunction, meaning one or the other (or both) must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden. This means the second part of the disjunction in Premise 1 is false.\n\nSince the second part of the disjunction is false, the only option left true is the first part: Fido must be inside. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
