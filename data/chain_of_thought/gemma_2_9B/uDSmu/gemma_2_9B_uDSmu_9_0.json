This sets up a disjunction (or) between two possibilities.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor. This negates one of the possibilities from Premise 1.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** Since one possibility is eliminated, the remaining possibility must be true.  \n\nTherefore, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
