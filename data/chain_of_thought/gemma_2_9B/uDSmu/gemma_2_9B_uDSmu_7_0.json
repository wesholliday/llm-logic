This sets up a disjunction, meaning one of these two options must be true.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet. This negates the second part of the disjunction.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** Since the second option is ruled out, the only remaining possibility is the first option. \n\n*Answer:* yes \n",
