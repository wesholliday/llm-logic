This can be written as P \u2228 Q.\n\nThe second statement tells us: not Q. This can be written as \u00acQ.\n\nNow, let's construct a truth table:\n\n| P | Q | P \u2228 Q | \u00acQ |\n|---|---|-------|-----|\n| T | T |   T   |  F  |\n| T | F |   T   |  T  |\n| F | T |   T   |  F  |\n| F | F |   F   |  T  |\n\nWe are looking for a scenario where both P \u2228 Q is true and \u00acQ is true.  Looking at the truth table, we see that the only row that satisfies both conditions is the second row (P=T, Q=F).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
