There's no other option according to this statement.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The cat might not be playing in the bedroom.\" This statement introduces uncertainty about the second possibility from Statement 1. It says the cat *might* not be playing in the bedroom, meaning it's possible, but not certain.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\nIf the cat isn't playing in the bedroom (as Statement 2 suggests), and the only other option (according to Statement 1) is napping on the couch, then we can infer that the cat must be napping on the couch.\n\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
