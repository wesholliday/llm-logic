There's no other option.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Fido might not be in the garden.\" This statement weakens the first statement by introducing the possibility that Fido isn't in the garden.\n\n* **Conclusion:** We want to know if we can conclude that Fido is inside.  Since the first statement says Fido must be *either* inside *or* in the garden, and the second statement says Fido might *not* be in the garden, the only remaining possibility is that Fido must be inside. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
