It presents two mutually exclusive possibilities: the sunglasses are in her bag, or they are on her head.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\" This statement weakens the second part of the disjunction in Statement 1. It introduces the possibility that the sunglasses are *not* on her head.\n\nSince the disjunction in Statement 1 covers all possibilities, and Statement 2 eliminates one of those possibilities, the remaining possibility must be true. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
