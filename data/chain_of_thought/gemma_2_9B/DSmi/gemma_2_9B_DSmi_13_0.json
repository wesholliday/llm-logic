There's no other option mentioned.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" This statement tells us that the toy is *not necessarily* on the bookshelf. It leaves open the possibility that it could be somewhere else.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\nSince the first statement says the toy *must* be in one of the two places, and the second statement says it's *not necessarily* on the bookshelf, the only remaining possibility is that the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes \n\n\n",
