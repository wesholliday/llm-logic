This means one of these two options must be true.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet. This doesn't say they definitely aren't, just that it's possible.\n\n3. **Combining the premises:** Since we know one of the two options must be true, and we're told it's possible the keys aren't in the cabinet, the only remaining option is that they must be in the drawer.\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
