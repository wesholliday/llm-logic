It means one of two things must be true: the pen is in the bag, or the pen is on the desk.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The pen might not be on my desk.\" This statement tells us that the pen is *not necessarily* on the desk. It leaves open the possibility that it could be somewhere else.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\nSince we know one of the two options must be true (Statement 1), and we know the pen isn't definitely on the desk (Statement 2), the only remaining possibility is that the pen must be in the bag. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
