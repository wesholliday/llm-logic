This tells us there are only two possibilities for the sunglasses' location.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** The sunglasses might not be perched on her head. This means the second possibility is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** Since the first possibility (sunglasses in the bag) is still valid and the second possibility is not guaranteed, we can infer that the sunglasses must be in her bag. \n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
