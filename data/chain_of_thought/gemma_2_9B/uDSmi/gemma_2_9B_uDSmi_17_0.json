This satisfies Statement 1.\n* **Scenario 2:** Scarf is on the coat rack. This also satisfies Statement 1, but contradicts Statement 2.\n\nSince Statement 2 tells us the scarf might *not* be on the coat rack, we can eliminate Scenario 2.  This leaves us with only Scenario 1 as a valid option.\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
