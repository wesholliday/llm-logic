It means the toy can be in one place or the other, but not both.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The toy might not be sitting on the shelf.\" This statement tells us it's possible, but not certain, that the toy is *not* on the shelf.\n\nSince the toy has to be in one of the two locations, and we know it's *possible* it's not on the shelf, the only remaining option is that it must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
