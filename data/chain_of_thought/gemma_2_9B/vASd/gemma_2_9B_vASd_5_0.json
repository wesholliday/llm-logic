This can be represented symbolically as P -> Q, where P is \"the bill is paid\" and Q is \"the services will continue.\"\n\n* **Conclusion:** If the bill is paid and the check bounces, then the services will continue. This can be represented as (P \u2227 R) -> Q, where R is \"the check bounces.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if the conclusion is a *logical consequence* of the premise.  In other words, if the premise is true, *must* the conclusion also be true?\n\nThe premise only tells us that if the bill is paid (P), then the services continue (Q). It doesn't say anything about what happens if the check bounces (R).  The check bouncing could happen regardless of whether the services continue or not.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion doesn't logically follow from the premise.  \n\nAnswer: no \n",
