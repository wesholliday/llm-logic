This sets up a conditional statement where going to the concert is the antecedent (the \"if\" part) and having a good time is the consequent (the \"then\" part).\n\n* **Conclusion:** If we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time. This also presents a conditional statement, but it adds an extra condition (a bomb going off) to the antecedent of the original premise.\n\nThe question of logical validity asks if the conclusion *must* be true if the premise is true.  \n\nHere's the key: the original premise doesn't say anything about what happens if a bomb goes off. It only states a general relationship between going to the concert and having a good time. Adding the extra condition about a bomb doesn't change the truth of the original premise.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion doesn't logically follow from the premise.  \n\nAnswer: no \n",
