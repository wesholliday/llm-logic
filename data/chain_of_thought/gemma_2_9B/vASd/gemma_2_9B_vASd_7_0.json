While the premise tells us that if the oven is on (P), the kitchen is warm (Q), it doesn't say anything about what happens when the pilot light is out (R) in conjunction with the oven being on.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively say that the kitchen *must* be warm if both the oven is on and the pilot light is out.  The pilot light's status might not be relevant to the oven heating the kitchen.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
