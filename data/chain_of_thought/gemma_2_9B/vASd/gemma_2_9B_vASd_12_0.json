This sets up a conditional relationship where finishing homework (P) is a necessary condition for playing video games (Q).\n\n* **Conclusion:** If P and R, then Q (If I finish my homework and my computer catches on fire, then I can play video games). This introduces a new condition (R: my computer catches on fire) to the original premise.\n\nThe question is whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.  \n\nEven though the premise states that finishing homework allows for video games, the conclusion adds an extra, unrelated condition (the computer fire).  The computer fire doesn't change the original relationship between homework and video games.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
