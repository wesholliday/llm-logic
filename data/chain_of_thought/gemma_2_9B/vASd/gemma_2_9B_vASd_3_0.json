This can be represented symbolically as P -> Q, where P is \"the car is in the garage\" and Q is \"it is safe\".\n\n* **Conclusion:** If the car is in the garage and the garage is flooding, then it is safe. This can be represented as (P and R) -> Q, where R is \"the garage is flooding\".\n\nNow, we need to determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premise.  \n\nThe premise tells us that if P is true (car is in the garage), then Q is true (it is safe).  The conclusion adds an additional condition, R (garage is flooding), but it still asserts that Q (it is safe) will be true.\n\nThe key question is: Does the premise provide enough information to guarantee the conclusion?  \n\nConsider a scenario where the car is in the garage and the garage is flooding.  The premise doesn't say anything about what happens when the garage is flooding. It only states that the car being in the garage makes it safe *in general*.  \n\nTherefore, the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premise.  It's possible for a car in a flooding garage to be unsafe.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
