Here's why:\n\n* **Premise:**  \"If I take medication, I will feel better.\" This premise establishes a general rule: taking medication leads to feeling better.\n* **Conclusion:** \"If I take medication that expired, I will feel better.\" This conclusion attempts to apply the premise to a specific type of medication (expired).\n\nThe problem is that the premise doesn't guarantee that *all* types of medication will have the same effect.  Expired medication may be ineffective or even dangerous. The argument makes a leap in logic by assuming that the general rule about medication applies to expired medication without providing any evidence to support this assumption.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
