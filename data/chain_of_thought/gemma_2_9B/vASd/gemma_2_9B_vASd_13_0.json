It doesn't say anything about what happens when you combine exercise with other factors like eating junk food.  \n\nIt's possible to exercise and still lose weight even if you eat junk food, but the premise doesn't guarantee it.  There are many other factors that influence weight loss, like overall calorie intake, metabolism, and genetics.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
