This establishes a direct causal relationship: filling the tank is a sufficient condition for the car running.\n\n* **Conclusion:** If you fill up the gas tank and there is a hole in it, the car will run. This introduces a new condition (a hole in the tank) while maintaining the original action (filling the tank).\n\nThe problem is that the hole in the tank creates a counter-condition.  A hole would likely cause the gas to leak out, preventing the car from running even if the tank is filled. The conclusion doesn't logically follow from the premise because it ignores a crucial factor that would negate the premise's condition.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
