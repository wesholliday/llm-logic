The conclusion introduces a new condition (being soaked in water) and asks if the rule still holds.  \n\nTo determine logical validity, we need to consider if the conclusion *must* be true if the premise is true.  \n\nHere's the key:  Soaking a match in water would likely prevent it from lighting. This means the conclusion is *not* guaranteed to be true even if the premise is true.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
