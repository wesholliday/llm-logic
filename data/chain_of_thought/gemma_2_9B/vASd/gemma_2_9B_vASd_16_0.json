This tells us that fertilization is a sufficient condition for a lush, green lawn.\n\n* **Conclusion:** If I fertilize the lawn and there is a drought, it will be lush and green. This statement combines the fertilization condition with an additional condition (drought).\n\nThe key here is to consider whether the drought negates the effect of the fertilizer.  We don't have enough information to know that.  It's possible that:\n\n* **Fertilizer overcomes drought:** The fertilizer might be strong enough to make the lawn lush and green even during a drought.\n* **Drought negates fertilizer:** The drought might be severe enough to prevent the fertilizer from having any effect, resulting in a brown, dry lawn.\n* **Drought has a mixed effect:** The drought might partially negate the fertilizer's effect, leading to a less lush and green lawn than if there were no drought.\n\n**Answer:** \nno \n",
