The premise only tells us about the relationship between sleep and tiredness. It doesn't say anything about how hard labor might interact with sleep in terms of tiredness.\n\nHard labor could potentially make you tired even if you get enough sleep.  \n\nTherefore, the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
