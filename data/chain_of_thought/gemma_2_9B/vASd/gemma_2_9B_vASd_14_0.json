The conclusion introduces an additional condition (the test being in Chinese) but still asserts that studying hard will lead to passing.  \n\nTo determine logical validity, we need to consider if the conclusion *must* be true if the premise is true.  \n\nHere's the key: the premise doesn't say anything about the language of the test. It's possible to study hard and still fail a test if you don't understand the language it's in.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
