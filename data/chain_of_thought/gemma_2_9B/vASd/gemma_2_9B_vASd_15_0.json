This premise establishes a conditional relationship: charging the phone is a sufficient condition for having power.\n\n* **Conclusion:** If I charge my phone and it has a dead battery, it will have power. This conclusion also presents a conditional statement, but it adds an extra condition: the phone must have a dead battery.\n\nNow, the key to determining logical validity is to see if the conclusion *logically follows* from the premise.  \n\nThe premise tells us that charging *always* leads to power. It doesn't say anything about the state of the battery before charging.  A dead battery doesn't negate the fact that charging will still result in power.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is a stronger statement than the premise.  \n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
