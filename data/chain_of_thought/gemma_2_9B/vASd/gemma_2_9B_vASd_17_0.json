This is a conditional statement.\n* **Conclusion:** If P and R, then Q (If I change the oil AND the transmission is shot, then the car will run smoothly).\n\nThe argument is trying to extend the original conditional statement to include an additional condition (the transmission being shot).  \n\nTo determine logical validity, we need to consider if the conclusion *must* be true if the premise is true.  \n\nHere's the key: the premise only guarantees smooth running *if* the oil change is the sole factor. It doesn't say anything about what happens when other factors are involved, like a faulty transmission.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
