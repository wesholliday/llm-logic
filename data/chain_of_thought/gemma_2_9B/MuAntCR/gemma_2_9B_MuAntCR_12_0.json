It doesn't provide any information about the project's completion date. \n* **Possible Scenarios:**  There are many scenarios where a project could be under budget without being completed by Friday. For example:\n    * The project deadline is next week.\n    * The project is ongoing and still has work to be done.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that the project was completed by Friday based solely on the given information. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
