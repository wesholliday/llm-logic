However, it doesn't provide any information about the formality of the event. \n\nEvents can require tickets for a variety of reasons, including:\n\n* **Formal events:** Weddings, galas, concerts, etc.\n* **Informal events:** Sporting events, festivals, community gatherings, etc.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the event must have been formal just because it required tickets.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
