It seems to be saying that the \"crunk\" needs to have a certain quality (\"wibble\") in order to be paired with a \"zibble\".  \n\nThe sentence doesn't directly state that the \"crunk\" *is* a \"zibble\", just that it needs to be \"wibble\" *for* a \"zibble\".  \n\nTherefore, we can't definitively say that the \"crunk\" must be a \"zibble\". \n\nAnswer: no \n",
