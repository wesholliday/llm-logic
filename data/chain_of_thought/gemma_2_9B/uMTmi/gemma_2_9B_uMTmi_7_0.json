This is a conditional statement.\n* **Premise 2:** Chris might not have finished the race. This means it's possible Chris did not finish.\n\n* **Conclusion:**  We want to know if we can infer that Alex did *not* finish the race.\n\nNotice that the statements don't directly tell us whether Alex finished or not.  Premise 1 only tells us what *would* happen if Alex finished.  Premise 2 tells us about Chris, not Alex.  \n\nSince we don't have enough information to definitively say whether Alex finished, we cannot infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
