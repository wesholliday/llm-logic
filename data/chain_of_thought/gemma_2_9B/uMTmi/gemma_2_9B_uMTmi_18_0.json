It says that the truth of one statement (doll being plastic) guarantees the truth of another (truck being metal).  \n\n* Premise 2 states that the truck's material is uncertain. It doesn't say it definitely wasn't metal, just that it's possible.\n\nNow, consider the question. We're asked if we can conclude the doll *wasn't* plastic.  \n\nThe key here is that the first premise only tells us what happens *if* the doll *is* plastic. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the doll *isn't* plastic.  \n\nSince we know the truck's material is uncertain, we can't definitively say the doll wasn't plastic.  It's possible the doll is plastic and the truck is metal, or it's possible the doll is not plastic.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
