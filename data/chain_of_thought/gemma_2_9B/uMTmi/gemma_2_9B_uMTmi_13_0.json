This is a conditional statement.\n* **Premise 2:** The truck might not have been blue. This means the truck could have been a different color.\n\n* **Conclusion:** Can we infer that the car was not red?\n\nLet's analyze:\n\nThe first premise tells us that *if* the car was red, *then* the truck would be blue.  It doesn't say anything about what happens if the car wasn't red.  The second premise tells us the truck wasn't necessarily blue, but it doesn't give us any information about the color of the car.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to definitively say the car wasn't red, we can't make that inference. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
