This is a conditional statement.\n* **Premise 2:** The cat might not have been outside. This means it's possible the cat was inside.\n\n* **Conclusion:** Can we infer that the dog was not inside?\n\nThe problem is that Premise 2 doesn't directly contradict Premise 1.  Premise 1 tells us what *must* happen if the dog is inside, but it doesn't say anything about what happens if the cat is *not* outside.  \n\nIt's possible for the dog to be inside and the cat to be inside as well.  \n\nAnswer: no \n",
