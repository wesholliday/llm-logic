This doesn't directly contradict the first premise. The first premise is a conditional statement \u2013 it only guarantees that *if* the cake was chocolate, *then* the muffins would be blueberry. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the cake wasn't chocolate.\n\n* **Conclusion:** We can't definitively say the cake wasn't chocolate based on the given information. \n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
