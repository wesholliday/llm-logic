            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nHere's how we can break down the logic:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\n* **Premise 2:** The banana might not have been yellow.\n\n* **What we need to determine:** Can we conclude that the apple was not red?\n\nLet's analyze the premises:\n\n* Premise 1 sets up a conditional statement. It tells us that redness of the apple is a *sufficient* condition for the banana to be yellow.  This means if the apple is red, the banana *must* be yellow. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the apple isn't red.\n\n* Premise 2 tells us there's a possibility the banana wasn't yellow. This doesn't directly tell us anything about the apple's color.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWe cannot definitively conclude that the apple was not red.  Premise 2 only tells us the banana *might* not have been yellow, not that it definitely wasn't.  The apple could have been red, and the banana could have been a different color.\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
