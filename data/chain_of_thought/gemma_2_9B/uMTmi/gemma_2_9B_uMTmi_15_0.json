It says that taking a plane is a *sufficient* condition for Erin taking a train.  This doesn't mean it's the *only* way Erin could take a train, just that if Sam took a plane, Erin would have to take a train too.\n\n* Premise 2 tells us there's a possibility Erin didn't take a train. This doesn't directly tell us anything about Sam's travel method.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe information given doesn't allow us to definitively say Sam didn't take a plane. It's possible Sam didn't take a plane, and Erin didn't take a train for some other reason.\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
