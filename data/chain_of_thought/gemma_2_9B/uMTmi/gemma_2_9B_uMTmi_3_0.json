This is a conditional statement.\n* **Premise 2:** The book might not be a mystery novel. This means it's possible the book is not a mystery novel.\n\n* **Conclusion:** Can we infer that the book was not written by James?\n\nWe need to consider the possibilities:\n\n* **Scenario 1:** The book IS a mystery novel.  If this is true, then the first premise tells us it MUST be written by James.\n* **Scenario 2:** The book IS NOT a mystery novel.  In this case, the first premise doesn't tell us anything about who wrote it. It only states the condition *if* it were written by James.\n\nSince we know the book *might* not be a mystery novel, Scenario 2 is a possibility. This means we can't definitively say the book was NOT written by James. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
