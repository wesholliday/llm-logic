Notice that Premise 2 doesn't directly say the unicorn *was not* in the forest, just that it's possible.\n\nThe first premise sets up a conditional statement. It tells us something must be true *if* a certain condition is met (the griffin being in the forest).  However, the second premise doesn't rule out the possibility that the griffin *was* in the forest.\n\nThink of it this way:\n\n* If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\n* The ground might not be wet.\n\nDoes this mean it's definitely not raining? No, there could be other reasons the ground isn't wet (like it just dried).\n\nSimilarly, we can't definitively say the griffin wasn't in the forest just because the unicorn might not have been.\n\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
