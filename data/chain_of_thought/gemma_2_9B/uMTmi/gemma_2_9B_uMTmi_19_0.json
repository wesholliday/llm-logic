            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nHere's how we can break down the logic:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. This is a conditional statement. It means that if the first part (Tom watching football) is true, then the second part (Jen watching basketball) must also be true.\n\n* **Premise 2:** Jen might not have watched basketball. This means it's possible, but not certain, that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\n* **The Question:** Can we infer that Tom did not watch football?\n\nNow, let's analyze:\n\nThe second premise doesn't directly tell us anything about whether Tom watched football or not. It only talks about the possibility of Jen not watching basketball.  The first premise establishes a connection between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball, but it doesn't say anything about what happens if Jen *didn't* watch basketball.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Tom did not watch football based on the given information. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
