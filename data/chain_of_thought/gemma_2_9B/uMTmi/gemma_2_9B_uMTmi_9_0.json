It doesn't directly say Mark *didn't* buy the blue shirt, just that it's possible.\n\nSince the first premise establishes a conditional relationship (if-then), the second premise doesn't automatically force us to say Lisa didn't buy the red shirt.  It's possible Lisa bought the red shirt and Mark still didn't buy the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
