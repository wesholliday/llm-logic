It tells us there's a possibility the wolf wasn't in the den, but it doesn't say for sure.  \n\nSince the first premise establishes a conditional relationship (\"if...then\"), the second premise doesn't directly contradict it.  It's possible for the wolf to be *somewhere else* besides the den, but that doesn't automatically mean the bear wasn't in the cave.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
