This is a conditional statement.\n* **Premise 2:** Kate might not have eaten salad. This means it's possible Kate didn't eat salad.\n\n* **Question:** Can we infer that Ben did not eat pasta?\n\nLet's analyze:\n\nThe first premise tells us that eating pasta *implies* eating salad for Kate.  However, the second premise doesn't say anything about whether Ben *did* eat pasta. It only tells us about the possibility of Kate not eating salad.\n\nSince we don't have information about whether Ben actually ate pasta, we cannot definitively conclude that he didn't. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
