This is a conditional statement.\n* **Premise 2:** The mummy might not have been awake. This means it's possible the mummy was asleep.\n\n* **Conclusion:** Can we infer that the vampire was not awake?\n\nWe can't definitively say the vampire was not awake. Here's why:\n\n* **The first premise only tells us what happens IF the vampire is awake.** It doesn't say anything about what happens if the vampire is asleep.\n* **The second premise only tells us about the mummy's state.** It doesn't give us any information about the vampire's state.\n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine the vampire is asleep.  The first premise wouldn't apply because it's based on the vampire being awake. The second premise is still true (the mummy could be asleep).\n\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
