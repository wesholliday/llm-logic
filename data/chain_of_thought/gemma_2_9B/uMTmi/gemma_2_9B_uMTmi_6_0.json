This is a conditional statement.\n* **Premise 2:** Bob might not have chosen pasta. This means it's possible Bob chose something else.\n\n* **Conclusion:**  Can we infer that Sue did not choose pizza?\n\nLet's analyze:\n\nThe first premise tells us that if Sue picked pizza, Bob *must* pick pasta.  However, the second premise only tells us that Bob *might not* have chosen pasta. It doesn't say anything definitive about what Sue chose.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to say for sure whether Bob chose pasta or not, we can't definitively conclude whether Sue chose pizza or not.  The first premise only sets up a relationship between Sue's choice and Bob's choice, but it doesn't give us enough to work backwards.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
