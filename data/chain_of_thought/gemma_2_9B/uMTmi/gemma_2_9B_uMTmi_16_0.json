It says that cotton shirts *always* lead to denim pants. \n* Premise 2 tells us there's a possibility the pants weren't denim.\n\nSince the pants *might* not be denim, it doesn't automatically mean the shirt *wasn't* cotton.  There could be other scenarios where the shirt is cotton and the pants are made of a different material.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
