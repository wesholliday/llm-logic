This is a conditional statement.\n* **Premise 2:** Sue might not have been at the wedding. This means it's possible Sue wasn't there.\n\n* **Conclusion:** Can we infer that Mary was not at the wedding?\n\nThe key here is to recognize that the first premise doesn't tell us anything about Mary's attendance *unless* we know Sue was at the wedding.  Since we're told Sue *might not* have been there, we can't definitively say Mary wasn't at the wedding.  \n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
