It tells us that if Alex's condition (finishing the race) is true, then Chris's condition (finishing the race) must also be true.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that Alex did *not* finish the race.  \n\nWe can use a technique called \"proof by contradiction\".  Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that Alex *did* finish the race.  \n\nIf Alex finished, then according to statement 2, Chris must have finished as well.  But statement 1 says Chris *might not* have finished. This creates a contradiction!\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that Alex finished the race must be false.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
