This can be represented as \"Amy played tennis\" being false.\n\n* **Statement 2:** If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. This can be represented as \"If P then Q\", where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis\".\n\nNow, let's consider the possible truth values for P and Q:\n\n| P (Jeff played basketball) | Q (Amy played tennis) |\n|---|---|\n| True | True |\n| True | False |\n| False | True |\n| False | False |\n\nStatement 2 tells us that if P is true (Jeff played basketball), then Q must be true (Amy played tennis).  This eliminates the second row of our truth table.\n\nWe are asked if we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball. This is the negation of P.  Looking at our truth table, we see that there are scenarios where P is false (Jeff did not play basketball) and the statements are still consistent.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n\n\n",
