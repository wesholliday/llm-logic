It says that if a certain condition (bear in the cave) is true, then another condition (wolf in the den) must also be true.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The bear was not in the cave\"?\n\nWe can't definitively say that. Here's why:\n\n* **Statement 1** doesn't tell us anything about the bear's location.\n* **Statement 2** only tells us what would happen *if* the bear was in the cave. It doesn't say anything about whether the bear actually *is* in the cave.\n\nWe need more information to determine the bear's location.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
