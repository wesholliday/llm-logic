This can be represented as \"K\" being false.\n\n* **Statement 2:** If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad. This can be represented as \"B -> K\".\n\nNow, let's consider the possible truth values for B (Ben ate pasta) and K (Kate ate salad):\n\n| B | K | B -> K |\n|---|---|-------|\n| T | T | T     |\n| T | F | F     |\n| F | T | T     |\n| F | F | T     |\n\nThe statement \"B -> K\" is only false when B is true and K is false.\n\nSince we know \"K\" might be false (Statement 1), it's possible that B is true and K is false.  Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
