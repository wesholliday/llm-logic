It says that if the dog is inside, then we can definitely conclude the cat was outside.\n\nNow, to determine if we can infer \"The dog was not inside,\" we need to consider the implications of both statements.  If we assume the dog *was* inside, Statement 2 tells us the cat *must* have been outside. However, Statement 1 says the cat *might not* have been outside. This creates a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, assuming the dog was inside leads to a logical inconsistency. This means our initial assumption must be wrong.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n\n\n",
