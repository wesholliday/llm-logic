This can be represented as:\n    * J \u2192 F (Jen watched basketball implies football)\n* **Statement 2:** If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. This can be represented as:\n    * T \u2192 J (Tom watched football implies Jen watched basketball)\n\nNow, we want to see if we can infer:\n* **Conclusion:** Tom did not watch football. This can be represented as:\n    * \u00acT (Not Tom watched football)\n\nLet's construct a truth table:\n\n| T | J | \u00acT | J \u2192 F | T \u2192 J |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| True | True | False | True | True |\n| True | False | False | False | False |\n| False | True | True | True | True |\n| False | False | True | True | True |\n\nAs you can see, the only row where both premises (J \u2192 F and T \u2192 J) are true is when T is False and J is True.  \n\nTherefore, we **cannot** infer that Tom did not watch football. \n\nAnswer: no \n\n\n",
