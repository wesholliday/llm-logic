It doesn't give us a definite answer about Erin's travel method.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\" This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if Sam's mode of transport was a plane, then Erin *definitely* took a train.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can conclude that Sam *didn't* take a plane.  \n\nNotice that the first statement doesn't give us any information about Sam's travel plans. The second statement only tells us what would happen *if* Sam took a plane.  It doesn't say anything about whether or not Sam actually did take a plane.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Sam did not take a plane based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
