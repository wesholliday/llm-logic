Modus tollens is a valid argument form that states:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's apply this to our problem:\n\n* P: The vampire was awake.\n* Q: The mummy must have been awake.\n\nWe are given:\n\n* \"The mummy might not have been awake\" - This translates to \"Not Q\".\n* \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake\" - This translates to \"If P, then Q\".\n\nSince we have both \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not Q\", we can apply modus tollens to conclude \"Not P\".\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n\n\n",
