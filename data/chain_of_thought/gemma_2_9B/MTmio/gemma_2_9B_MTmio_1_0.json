It doesn't give us a definite answer.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This statement establishes a conditional relationship. It says that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue definitely attended as well.\n\nNow, to determine if we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding, we need to consider the implications of these statements.  \n\nIf we assume Mary *was* at the wedding, then according to statement 2, Sue *must* have been there too. However, statement 1 says Sue *might not* have been there. This creates a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that Mary was at the wedding must be false.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
