It doesn't give us a definite answer.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" This statement introduces a conditional relationship. It says that if the doll is plastic, then we can be certain the truck is metal.\n\nNow, to determine if we can infer that the doll was not plastic, we need to consider the implications of these statements.  If we assume the doll *was* plastic, then according to statement 2, the truck *must* have been metal. However, statement 1 says the truck *might not* have been metal. This creates a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that the doll was plastic must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
