Modus tollens is a valid argument form that states:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down the statements:\n\n1. **P:** The cake was chocolate.\n2. **Q:** The muffins must have been blueberry.\n\n* **Statement 1:** \"The muffins might not have been blueberry\" can be rephrased as \"It is possible the muffins were not blueberry.\" This doesn't directly negate Q, so it doesn't fit the modus tollens structure.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry\"  is our \"If P, then Q\" statement.\n\nSince we don't have a direct negation of Q, we cannot apply modus tollens to conclude that the cake was not chocolate. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
