Modus tollens is a valid argument form that states:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's apply this to our problem:\n\n* P: The car was red.\n* Q: The truck must have been blue.\n\nWe are given:\n\n* \"The truck might not have been blue\" - This translates to \"Not Q\".\n* \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\" - This is our \"If P, then Q\" statement.\n\nSince we have \"Not Q\" and \"If P, then Q\", modus tollens allows us to conclude \"Not P\".\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n\n\n",
