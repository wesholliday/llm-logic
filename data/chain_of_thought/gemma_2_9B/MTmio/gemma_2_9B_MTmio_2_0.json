It says that the presence of a griffin guarantees the presence of a unicorn in the forest.\n\nNow, to determine if we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest, we need to consider the implications of these statements.  If we assume the griffin *was* in the forest, then according to statement 2, the unicorn *must* have been there too. However, statement 1 says the unicorn *might not* have been there. This creates a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that the griffin was in the forest must be false.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
