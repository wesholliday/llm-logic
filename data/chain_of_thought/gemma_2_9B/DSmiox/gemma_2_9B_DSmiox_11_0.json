It states that the flug must be either blummed or zimmed, with no other possibilities.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship:\n\nIf we assume the flug is *not* blummed, then according to statement 2, it *must* be zimmed. However, statement 1 tells us it's *possible* the flug isn't zimmed.  \n\nThis creates a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption that the flug is not blummed must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
