It doesn't definitively say it's not spened, just that it's a possibility.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"Either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened.\"** This statement presents a disjunction. It says that one of two things *must* be true: either the dreb is vroombed, or it must be spened.\n\nNow, let's consider the relationship between these statements:\n\n* If the dreb *is* spened, then Statement 2 is satisfied (the \"or\" part).\n* If the dreb *is not* spened, then Statement 2 *must* mean that it is vroombed (the \"or\" part).\n\nSince Statement 1 allows for the possibility that the dreb is not spened, and Statement 2 dictates that if it's not spened, it *must* be vroombed, we can infer that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
