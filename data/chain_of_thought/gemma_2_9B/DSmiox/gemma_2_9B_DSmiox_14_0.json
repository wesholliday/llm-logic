It doesn't definitively say it's not snugged, just that it's a possibility.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"Either the clug is fleeked or it must be snugged.\"** This statement presents a disjunction. It claims that one of two things must be true: either the clug is fleeked, or it must be snugged.\n\nNow, let's consider the relationship between these statements:\n\nIf we assume the clug is *not* snugged (as suggested by Statement 1), then Statement 2 would require the clug to be fleeked. This is because the disjunction in Statement 2 states that if it's not snugged, it *must* be fleeked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
