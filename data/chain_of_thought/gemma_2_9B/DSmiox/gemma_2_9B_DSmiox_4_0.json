There are no other options.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities:\n\n* If the fribble is crinked, Statement 2 is satisfied.\n* If the fribble is not crinked, Statement 2 tells us it *must* be snurgled.\n\nSince Statement 1 allows for the possibility that the fribble is not crinked, and Statement 2 dictates that if it's not crinked, it must be snurgled, we can conclude...\n\nAnswer: yes \n\n\n",
