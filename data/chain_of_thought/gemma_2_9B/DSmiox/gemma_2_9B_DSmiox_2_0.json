It doesn't definitively say it isn't bimmed, just that it's a possibility.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"Either the wug is flooped or it must be bimmed.\"** This statement presents a disjunction. It claims that one of two things must be true: either the wug is flooped, or it must be bimmed.\n\nNow, let's consider the relationship between these statements:\n\n* If the wug *is* bimmed, then Statement 2 is satisfied (the \"it must be bimmed\" part).\n* If the wug *is not* bimmed, then Statement 2 forces the conclusion that it must be flooped (since the other option is ruled out).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the wug *must* be flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
