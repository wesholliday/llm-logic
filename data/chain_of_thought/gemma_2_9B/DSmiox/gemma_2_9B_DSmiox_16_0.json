There's no middle ground.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If the sneg *is* sproted, Statement 1 doesn't contradict Statement 2.\n\n* If the sneg *is not* sproted, then Statement 1 is true, and Statement 2 forces the sneg to be crampled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sneg must be crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
