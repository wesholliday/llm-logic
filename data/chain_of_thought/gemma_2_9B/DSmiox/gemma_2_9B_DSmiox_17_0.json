It states that the flob must be either skizzled OR movated; there's no other option.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship:\n\nIf the flob is NOT movated (as per Statement 1), then according to Statement 2, it MUST be skizzled.  \n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
