It doesn't definitively say it isn't garpled, just that it's a possibility.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"Either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled.\"** This statement presents a disjunction. It claims that the wug must be either sproinged *or* garpled; there's no other option.\n\nNow, let's consider the relationship between these statements:\n\nIf we assume the wug is *not* sproinged, then Statement 2 forces us to conclude that the wug *must* be garpled. However, Statement 1 tells us that the wug *might not* be garpled.\n\nThis creates a contradiction.  Therefore, our initial assumption that the wug is *not* sproinged must be false.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n\n\n",
