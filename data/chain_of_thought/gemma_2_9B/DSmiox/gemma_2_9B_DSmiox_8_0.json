There's no middle ground.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that the sprocket is cranked.  \n\nIf the sprocket is *not* daggled, then according to statement 2, it *must* be cranked.  However, statement 1 tells us it's *possible* the sprocket isn't daggled.  \n\nTherefore, we can't definitively say the sprocket is cranked. It could be cranked, or it could be daggled.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
