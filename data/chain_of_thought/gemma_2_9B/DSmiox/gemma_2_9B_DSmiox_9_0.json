It doesn't definitively say it isn't plinked, just that it's a possibility.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"Either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked.\"** This statement presents a disjunction. It says that one of two things *must* be true: either the twonk is varnished, or it must be plinked. There's no middle ground.\n\nNow, let's consider how these statements relate:\n\n* If the twonk *is* plinked, then Statement 2 is satisfied (the \"or\" part).\n* If the twonk *is not* plinked, then Statement 2 forces the conclusion that it *must* be varnished.\n\nSince Statement 1 allows for the possibility that the twonk isn't plinked, and Statement 2 dictates that if it's not plinked, it *must* be varnished, we can logically conclude that the twonk *must* be varnished.\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
