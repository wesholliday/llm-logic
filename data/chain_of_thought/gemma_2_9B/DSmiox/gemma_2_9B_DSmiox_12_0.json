It says the smip must be either shripped *or* lupped, leaving no other option.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that the smip is shripped.  \n\nSince the second statement says the smip *must* be either shripped or lupped, and the first statement doesn't rule out the possibility of it being shripped, we can't definitively say it *must* be shripped. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
