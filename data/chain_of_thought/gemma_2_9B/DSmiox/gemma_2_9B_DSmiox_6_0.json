It states that the grommet must be either sploffed OR plopped; there's no other option.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If the grommet is plopped, Statement 2 is satisfied.\n* If the grommet is not plopped, Statement 2 forces it to be sploffed.\n\nSince Statement 1 allows for the possibility of the grommet not being plopped, and Statement 2 dictates that if it's not plopped, it must be sploffed, we can conclude that the grommet must be sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
