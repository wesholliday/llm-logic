It doesn't say it definitely isn't.\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the glip is slogged or it must be tragged\" - This presents a disjunction. It says the glip must be either slogged OR tragged, there are no other options.\n\nNow, let's analyze together:\n\nIf the glip is *not* tragged (as per statement 1), then according to statement 2, it *must* be slogged.  \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
