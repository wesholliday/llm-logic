It says the flugel must be either blimmed *or* zargled, there are no other options.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If the flugel *is* zargled, then Statement 2 is satisfied.\n* If the flugel *is not* zargled, then Statement 2 forces it to be blimmed.\n\nSince Statement 1 allows for the possibility that the flugel is not zargled, and Statement 2 dictates that if it's not zargled, it must be blimmed, we can conclude...\n\nAnswer: yes \n\n\n",
