A disjunctive syllogism has the form:\n\n* P or Q\n* Not Q\n* Therefore, P\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The notebook is in the drawer\n* Q: The notebook is sitting on the nightstand\n\nThe argument follows this structure. Since the second premise tells us the notebook is *not* on the nightstand (not Q), and the first premise states that it must be either in the drawer or on the nightstand (P or Q),  the only remaining possibility is that the notebook must be in the drawer (P).\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
