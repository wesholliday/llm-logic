A disjunctive syllogism has the form:\n\n* P or Q\n* Not Q\n* Therefore, P\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n* Q: The missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor.\n\nThe argument follows this structure perfectly. Since the second premise tells us the missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor (which is the negation of Q), and the first premise establishes that it must be either in the box or blending in on the floor, the conclusion that it must be in the box logically follows. \n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
