A disjunctive syllogism has the form:\n\n* P or Q\n* Not Q\n* Therefore, P\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The shoes are in the closet\n* Q: The shoes are lined up by the door\n\nThe argument follows this structure. Since the second premise tells us the shoes might not be lined up by the door (not Q), and the first premise states that either the shoes are in the closet or lined up by the door (P or Q),  the only remaining logical conclusion is that the shoes must be in the closet (P).\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
