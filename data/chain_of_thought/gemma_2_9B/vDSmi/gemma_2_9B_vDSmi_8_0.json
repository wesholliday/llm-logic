The second premise introduces doubt about the remote being under the couch.  \n\nTo determine logical validity, we need to consider if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. If the premises are true, does the conclusion *must* also be true?\n\n* If the remote is *not* under the couch (as the second premise suggests), and the only other option (the first premise) is that it's on the coffee table, then the conclusion is indeed supported.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
