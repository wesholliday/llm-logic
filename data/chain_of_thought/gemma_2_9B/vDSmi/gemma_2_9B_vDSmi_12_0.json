A disjunctive syllogism has the form:\n\n* P or Q\n* Not Q\n* Therefore, P\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The jacket is draped over the chair\n* Q: The jacket is hanging in the closet\n\nThe argument follows this structure. Since the second premise tells us the jacket might not be hanging in the closet (which is the negation of Q), and the first premise establishes that either the jacket is draped over the chair (P) or hanging in the closet (Q),  the only remaining possibility is that the jacket must be draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
