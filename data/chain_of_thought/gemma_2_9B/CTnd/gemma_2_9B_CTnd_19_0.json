In this case, P is \"directions were provided\" and Q is \"they were not explained clearly\".  \n\nThe new statement is also a conditional statement, but with the order of P and Q reversed.  \n\nTo determine if we can infer the new statement from the original, we need to consider the relationship between the two conditional statements.  \n\nThe original statement tells us that if directions were provided, they were *not* explained clearly. This doesn't necessarily mean that if directions *were* explained clearly, they *weren't* provided.  \n\nFor example, it's possible that no directions were provided at all.  \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the original.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
