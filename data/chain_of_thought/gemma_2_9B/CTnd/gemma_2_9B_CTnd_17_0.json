This can be represented as:\n\n* Q -> ~P\n\nThis statement says that if the customer was greeted warmly (Q is true), then they were *not* greeted (P is false).\n\nNotice that the original statement and the question have swapped the truth values of P and Q.  The original statement says that greeting implies *not* warm greeting, while the question asks if warm greeting implies *not* greeting. These are logically different.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
