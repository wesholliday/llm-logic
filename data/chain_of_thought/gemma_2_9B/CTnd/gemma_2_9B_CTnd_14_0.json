This suggests a contradiction.\n\nThe proposed inference, however, suggests that if a meal was prepared carefully, it couldn't have been prepared at all. This is a stronger claim than the original statement.\n\nSince the original statement doesn't provide enough information to support the stronger claim of the proposed inference, we cannot logically infer it.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
