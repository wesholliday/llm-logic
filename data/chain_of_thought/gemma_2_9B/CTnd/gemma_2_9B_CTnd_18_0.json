It says that if a certain condition (the issue was discussed) is met, then another condition (it was not discussed in depth) must also be met.  \n\nThe proposed inference is also a conditional statement, but it's the reverse of the original. It says that if the second condition (the issue was discussed in depth) is met, then the first condition (the issue was discussed) must not be met.\n\nTo determine if the inference is valid, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.  The original statement implies that there's a kind of exclusivity between \"discussed\" and \"discussed in depth.\" If something is discussed, it cannot be discussed in depth.\n\nThe proposed inference flips this relationship, suggesting that if something is discussed in depth, it cannot have been discussed at all. This is a contradiction to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, the inference is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
