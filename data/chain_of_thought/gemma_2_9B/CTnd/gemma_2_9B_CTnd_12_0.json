This can be represented as:\n\n* Q -> ~P\n\nThis statement claims that if Jane studied long (Q is true), then she did not study (P is false).\n\nNotice that the original statement and the new statement have swapped the truth values of P and Q in their consequent parts.  \n\nThe original statement doesn't provide any information about what happens when Jane studies long. It only tells us what happens when she studies.  Therefore, we cannot logically infer the new statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
