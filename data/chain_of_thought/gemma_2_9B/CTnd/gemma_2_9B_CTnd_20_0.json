The original statement tells us that if a recommendation *was* made, it couldn't be strong. It doesn't say anything about what happens if a recommendation *wasn't* strong.\n\nFor example, it's possible to have a situation where no recommendation was made at all. In that case, both P and Q would be false, and the original statement wouldn't apply.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer \"If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made\" from the given statement. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
