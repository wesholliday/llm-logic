It says that if a certain condition (Ann exercising) is met, then a specific outcome (not exercising strenuously) will occur.  \n\nThe question asks if we can infer a new conditional statement: If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise.  \n\nNotice the difference in the order of the conditions and outcomes. The original statement says exercising leads to *not* exercising strenuously. The question asks if the opposite is also true: exercising strenuously leads to *not* exercising at all.\n\nThese are not logically equivalent.  It's possible for someone to exercise without exercising strenuously.  \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the new conditional statement from the original one. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
