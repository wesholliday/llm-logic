This can be represented as:\n\n* Q -> ~P\n\nIs this a valid inference?  \n\nLet's think about the relationship between the two statements. The original statement says that exercising leads to *not* exercising much. The new statement says that exercising much leads to *not* exercising. These are essentially opposite implications.  \n\nSince the original statement doesn't provide any information about what happens when Alex exercises much, we cannot logically conclude that if he exercised much, he did not exercise. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
