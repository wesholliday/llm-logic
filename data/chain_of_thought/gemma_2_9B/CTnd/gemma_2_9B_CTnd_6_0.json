It suggests there's a possibility they were washed but not effectively.\n\nThe proposed inference, however, states that if the clothes were washed properly, they couldn't have been washed at all. This is a contradiction to the original statement, which allows for the possibility of washing.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer the proposed statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
