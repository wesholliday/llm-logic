            "content": "\n\nExplanation: \nThis question tests our understanding of logical implication and its inverse. \n\n* **Original Statement:** \"If I ate a meal, then I did not eat a large meal.\"  This can be represented symbolically as P -> ~Q, where P is \"I ate a meal\" and Q is \"I ate a large meal.\"\n\n* **Inverse Statement:** \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal.\" This can be represented as Q -> ~P.\n\n* **Relationship:** The original statement and its inverse are not logically equivalent.  The original statement says that eating a meal *prevents* eating a large meal. The inverse says that eating a large meal *prevents* eating a meal. These are not necessarily the same thing.\n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine a scenario where I ate a small meal. This satisfies the original statement (I ate a meal, but not a large one). However, it doesn't satisfy the inverse (I ate a small meal, which is still a meal).\n\n\nAnswer: \nno",
