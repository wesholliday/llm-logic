This can be represented as:\n\n* Q -> ~P\n\nThis statement claims that if Ben studied diligently (Q is true), then he did not study (P is false).\n\nNotice that the original statement and the proposed inference have swapped the truth values of P and Q.  The original statement negates the truth of Q when P is true, while the proposed inference negates the truth of P when Q is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot directly infer the proposed statement from the original statement. The original statement does not provide enough information to support the claim that studying diligently would necessarily lead to not studying at all.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
