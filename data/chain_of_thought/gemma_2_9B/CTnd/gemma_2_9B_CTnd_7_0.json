The original statement is a conditional statement, meaning it has the form \"If P, then Q\". In this case:\n\n* P: The customer was served.\n* Q: He was not served promptly.\n\nThe statement tells us that if the customer was served (P), then it's a guarantee that he was not served promptly (Q).  \n\nNow, let's examine the proposed inference:\n\n* If the customer was served promptly (P'), then he was not served (Q').\n\nNotice that the proposed inference reverses the relationship between P and Q.  The original statement establishes a connection where being served implies not being served promptly. The proposed inference suggests that being served promptly implies not being served at all.\n\nThese are logically distinct relationships.  The original statement doesn't provide any information to support the proposed inference.  \n\nAnswer: no \n",
