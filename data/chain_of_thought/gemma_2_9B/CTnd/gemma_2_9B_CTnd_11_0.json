The original statement says that if you go to the store, you *cannot* buy vegetables. The inverse says that if you buy vegetables, you *cannot* go to the store. These are different possibilities.\n\nConsider a scenario where I went to the store but bought something else. The original statement holds true. However, the inverse would be false in this case.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
