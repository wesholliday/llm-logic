Here:\n\n* P: The issue was addressed.\n* Q: It was addressed effectively.\n\nThe proposed inference is also a conditional statement, but with the form \"If Q, then not P\".  \n\nNotice that these are logically opposite. The original statement says that if something is addressed, it cannot be addressed *effectively*. The proposed inference says that if something is addressed *effectively*, it cannot have been addressed at all.\n\nThese are contradictory statements.  \n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
