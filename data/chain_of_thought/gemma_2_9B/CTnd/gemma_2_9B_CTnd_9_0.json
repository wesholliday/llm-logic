The original statement talks about the consequence of instructions being given, while the desired statement talks about the consequence of instructions *not* being given.  \n\nLogically, we cannot directly infer one from the other.  The original statement doesn't provide any information about what happens when instructions *aren't* given. It only tells us something about the relationship between giving instructions and their clarity.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
