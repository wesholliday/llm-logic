This can be represented as:\n\n* Q -> ~P\n\nThis statement asserts that if advice was helpful (Q), then advice was not offered (~P).\n\nNotice that the original statement and the inferred statement have the opposite logical structure. The original statement is a conditional statement where the antecedent (P) implies the negation of the consequent (Q). The inferred statement is also a conditional statement, but the antecedent (Q) implies the negation of the antecedent (P).\n\nThese two statements are logically **equivalent**.  \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
