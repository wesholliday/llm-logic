Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P = The book was written by James\n* Q = The book is a mystery novel\n\nThe argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens because:\n\n* Premise 1 states \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" (If P, then Q)\n* Premise 2 states \"The book is not a mystery novel\" (Not Q)\n* Conclusion states \"The book was not written by James\" (Therefore, not P)\n\nSince Modus Tollens is a valid argument form, and our argument follows its structure, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
