Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P = The griffin was in the forest\n* Q = The unicorn was in the forest\n\nThe argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens because:\n\n* Premise 1 states \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" (If P, then Q)\n* Premise 2 states \"The unicorn was not in the forest\" (Not Q)\n* Conclusion states \"The griffin was not in the forest\" (Therefore, not P)\n\nSince Modus Tollens is a valid argument form, and our argument follows its structure, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
