Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P = The bear was in the cave\n* Q = The wolf was in the den\n\nThe argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens because:\n\n1. We are given a conditional statement (If P, then Q).\n2. We are given the negation of the consequent (Not Q).\n3. We conclude the negation of the antecedent (Not P).\n\nSince Modus Tollens is a valid argument form, and our argument follows its structure, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
