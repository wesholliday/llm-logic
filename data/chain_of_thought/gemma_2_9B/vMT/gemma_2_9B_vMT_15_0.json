Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down how it applies to our example:\n\n* **P:** Sam took a plane.\n* **Q:** Erin took a train.\n\nThe argument states:\n\n1. If Sam took a plane (P), then Erin took a train (Q).\n2. Erin did not take a train (not Q).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion must be that Sam did not take a plane (not P).\n\nSince Modus Tollens is a valid argument form, this argument is also logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
