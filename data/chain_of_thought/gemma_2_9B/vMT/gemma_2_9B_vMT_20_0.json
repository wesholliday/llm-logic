Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down our example:\n\n* P: The apple was red.\n* Q: The banana was yellow.\n\nThe argument states that if the apple was red (P), then the banana would have to be yellow (Q). However, we are told the banana was not yellow (not Q).  Therefore, according to the rules of Modus Tollens, we can conclude that the apple was not red (not P).\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
