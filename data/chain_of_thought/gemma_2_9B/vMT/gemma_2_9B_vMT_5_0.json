Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down how it applies to our example:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If Jeff played basketball (P), then Amy played tennis (Q).\n* **Premise 2:** Amy did not play tennis (not Q).\n* **Conclusion:** Therefore, Jeff did not play basketball (not P).\n\nSince the argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens, and Modus Tollens is a valid argument form, the argument itself is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
