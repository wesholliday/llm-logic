Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down how it applies to our example:\n\n* **P:** Sue chose pizza\n* **Q:** Bob chose pasta\n\nThe argument states:\n\n1. If Sue chose pizza (P), then Bob chose pasta (Q).\n2. Bob did not choose pasta (not Q).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion must be that Sue did not choose pizza (not P).  This follows the structure of Modus Tollens and is therefore a logically valid argument. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
