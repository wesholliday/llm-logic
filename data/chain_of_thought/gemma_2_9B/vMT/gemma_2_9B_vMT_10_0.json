Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down our example:\n\n* **P:** The dog was inside.\n* **Q:** The cat was outside.\n\nThe argument states:\n\n1. If the dog was inside (P), then the cat was outside (Q).\n2. The cat was not outside (not Q).\n\nTherefore, the dog was not inside (not P).\n\nSince the argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens, and the premises are assumed to be true, the conclusion logically follows. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
