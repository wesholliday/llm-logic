            "content": "\n\nExplanation: \nThis argument is structured as a type of logical deduction called *modus tollens*.  Modus tollens is a valid argument form.  Here's how it works:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If P, then Q (If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race)\n* **Premise 2:** Not Q (Chris did not finish the race)\n* **Conclusion:** Therefore, not P (Alex did not finish the race)\n\nThe key to understanding modus tollens is that it works because the first premise establishes a direct link between Alex finishing the race and Chris finishing the race. If we know Chris *didn't* finish, it logically follows that Alex couldn't have finished either.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
