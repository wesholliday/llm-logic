Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down how it applies to our example:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If the shirt was cotton (P), then the pants were denim (Q).\n* **Premise 2:** The pants were not denim (not Q).\n* **Conclusion:** Therefore, the shirt was not cotton (not P).\n\nSince the argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens, and Modus Tollens is a valid argument form, this argument is also logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
