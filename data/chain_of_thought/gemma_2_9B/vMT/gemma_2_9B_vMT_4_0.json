Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down how it applies to our example:\n\n* **P:** The alien visited Mars.\n* **Q:** The robot visited Jupiter.\n\nThe argument states:\n\n1. If the alien visited Mars (P), then the robot visited Jupiter (Q).\n2. The robot did not visit Jupiter (not Q).\n\nTherefore, the alien did not visit Mars (not P).\n\nSince the argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens, and the premises are assumed to be true, the conclusion logically follows. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
