This is a conditional statement, meaning it proposes a relationship where one event (doll being plastic) implies another (truck being metal).\n\n* **Premise 2:** The truck was not metal. This contradicts the potential outcome of the first premise.\n\n* **Conclusion:** The doll was not plastic. This is the conclusion we are trying to determine if it logically follows from the premises.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities:\n\n1. **If the doll was plastic:**  Premise 1 states that if this were true, the truck would have to be metal. However, Premise 2 tells us the truck was not metal. This creates a contradiction.\n\n2. **If the doll was not plastic:** This scenario doesn't violate either premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument's structure leads us to the conclusion that the doll must not be plastic to avoid contradicting the given information.\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
