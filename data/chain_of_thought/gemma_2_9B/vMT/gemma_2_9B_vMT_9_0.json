Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down how it applies to our example:\n\n* **P:** Lisa bought the red shirt.\n* **Q:** Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nThe argument presents:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If Lisa bought the red shirt (P), then Mark bought the blue shirt (Q).\n* **Premise 2:** Mark did not buy the blue shirt (not Q).\n\nFollowing the Modus Tollens structure, if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.  Therefore, if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark would have bought the blue shirt, but we know Mark didn't buy the blue shirt. This means Lisa couldn't have bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
