Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down our example:\n\n* P: The cake was chocolate.\n* Q: The muffins were blueberry.\n\nThe argument states that if the cake was chocolate (P), then the muffins would have to be blueberry (Q). However, we are also told that the muffins were not blueberry (not Q).  Therefore, based on the structure of the argument and the rules of Modus Tollens, we can conclude that the cake was not chocolate (not P).\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
