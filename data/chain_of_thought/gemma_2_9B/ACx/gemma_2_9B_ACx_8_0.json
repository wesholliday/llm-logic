We're dealing with a conditional statement (\"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\") and a factual statement (\"The sprocket was daggled\").  \n\nLet's break down the logic:\n\n* **Conditional Statement:**  A conditional statement has the form \"If P, then Q\". It asserts that if the condition (P) is true, then a consequence (Q) will follow.\n\n* **Factual Statement:** A factual statement asserts something to be true.\n\n* **Inference:** An inference is a conclusion drawn from given information.\n\nIn this case, the factual statement tells us that \"The sprocket was daggled\".  The conditional statement says that if the sprocket was cranked, then it would be daggled.  \n\nSince the consequence (daggled) is true, we can't definitively say that the condition (cranked) must also be true. There could be other reasons why the sprocket was daggled.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
