We are given two statements:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\" This is a conditional statement, meaning it proposes a cause-and-effect relationship. It states that if a certain event (vroombing) happens, then another event (spening) must also happen.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The dreb was spened.\" This statement tells us that the event of spening occurred.\n\nThe question asks if we can infer from these premises that the event of vroombing also occurred.  This relates to a logical rule called *modus ponens*.\n\n*Modus ponens* states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know that Q is true, we can conclude that P is also true.\n\nLet's apply this to our example:\n\n* P: The dreb was vroombed\n* Q: The dreb was spened\n\nWe know Q is true (Premise 2).  Premise 1 tells us that if P is true, then Q is true.  Therefore, according to *modus ponens*, we can conclude that P must also be true.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
