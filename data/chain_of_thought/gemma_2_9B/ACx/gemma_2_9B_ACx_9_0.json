We're dealing with a conditional statement (\"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished\") and a fact (\"The twonk was varnished\").  \n\nLet's break down the logic:\n\n* **Conditional Statement:**  \"If P, then Q\" means that if the first part (P) is true, then the second part (Q) must also be true. In our case, P is \"the twonk was plinked\" and Q is \"it was varnished.\"\n\n* **Fact:** \"The twonk was varnished\" tells us that Q is true.\n\n* **Inference:** We want to know if we can conclude that P (the twonk was plinked) is also true.\n\n**Applying the Logic:**\n\nThe structure of the conditional statement and the given fact allows us to make this inference.  Since the twonk was varnished (Q is true), and we know that if it was plinked (P) it would have been varnished, we can conclude that it must have been plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
