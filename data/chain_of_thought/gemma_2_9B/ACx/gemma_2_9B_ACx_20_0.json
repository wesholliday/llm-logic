(This is a conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** The fleeg surned. (This is a statement about the consequent of the conditional)\n\n**Modus Ponens** states that if we have a conditional statement and the consequent is true, we can infer the antecedent.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* The antecedent is \"the fleeg was bluttered\"\n* The consequent is \"it surned\"\n\nSince we know the consequent (\"The fleeg surned\") is true, Modus Ponens allows us to infer that the antecedent (\"The fleeg was bluttered\") must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
