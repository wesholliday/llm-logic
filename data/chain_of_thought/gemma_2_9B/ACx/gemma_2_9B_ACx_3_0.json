If P, then Q (conditional statement)\n2. P (affirmation of the antecedent)\n\nThen we can conclude:\n\nQ (affirmation of the consequent)\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The splat was morphed\n* Q: The splat quanked\n\n* Premise 1: If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\n* Premise 2: The splat quanked.\n\nSince we have both the conditional statement and the affirmation of the consequent, we can apply Modus Ponens to conclude that the antecedent (the splat was morphed) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
