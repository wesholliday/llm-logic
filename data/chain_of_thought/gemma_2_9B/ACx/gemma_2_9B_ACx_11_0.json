(This is our \"If P then Q\" statement)\n    * **Premise 2:** The flug was zimmed. (This is our \"P\" statement)\n\n*  We need to determine if we can logically conclude that \"The flug was blummed\" (which is our \"Q\" statement).\n\n*  Since Premise 2 (The flug was zimmed) matches the consequent (Q) in our modus ponens structure, and we have the antecedent (P) condition, we can apply modus ponens to conclude that the antecedent must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
