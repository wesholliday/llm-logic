Modus ponens is a valid argument form that states:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* P.\n* Therefore, Q.\n\nLet's break down the given statements:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint.\"  This is our \"If P, then Q\" statement.\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The smip lupped the zoint.\" This is our \"P\" statement.\n\nWe need to determine if we can logically conclude \"The smip was shripped\" (Q) from these premises.\n\nAccording to modus ponens, since we have both the \"If P, then Q\" statement and the \"P\" statement, we can indeed conclude \"Q\".\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
