We're dealing with a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and a statement that affirms Q.  \n\nLet's break down the statements:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled. (This is our conditional statement. P = \"the flugel was blimmed\", Q = \"the flugel was zargled\")\n* **Premise 2:** The flugel was zargled. (This affirms Q)\n\nThe question asks if we can infer P (the flugel was blimmed) from these premises.  \n\nThis is where the concept of modus ponens comes in. Modus ponens is a valid argument form that states:\n\nIf P, then Q.\nQ is true.\nTherefore, P is true.\n\nLet's see if our premises fit this form:\n\n* Our P is \"the flugel was blimmed\"\n* Our Q is \"the flugel was zargled\"\n\nPremise 1 sets up the conditional relationship (If P, then Q). Premise 2 tells us Q is true.  \n\nTherefore, according to modus ponens, we can infer that P must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
