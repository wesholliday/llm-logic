            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nThis question tests our understanding of logical implication and its inverse. \n\n* **Original Statement:** If Tom watched football, then Jen did not watch basketball.  This can be represented symbolically as:  \n   P \u2192 \u00acQ \n   (where P = Tom watched football, Q = Jen watched basketball)\n\n* **Inverse Statement:** If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football. This can be represented as:\n   Q \u2192 \u00acP\n\n* **Relationship:** The original statement and its inverse are not logically equivalent.  The original statement says that if Tom watches football, then Jen *cannot* watch basketball. The inverse says that if Jen watches basketball, then Tom *cannot* watch football. These are not necessarily true in all cases.\n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine a scenario where neither Tom nor Jen watched either sport.  The original statement would be true (because the antecedent, Tom watching football, is false). However, the inverse would be false (because the antecedent, Jen watching basketball, is false).\n\n\n\nAnswer: \nno",
