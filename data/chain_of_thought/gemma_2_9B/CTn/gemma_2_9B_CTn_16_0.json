            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nThis question tests our understanding of logical implication and its inverse. \n\n* **Original Statement:** \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim.\"  This can be represented symbolically as P -> ~Q, where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim.\"\n\n* **Inverse Statement:** \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\" This can be represented as Q -> ~P.\n\n* **Relationship:** The original statement and its inverse are not logically equivalent.  The original statement says that if the shirt *is* cotton, then the pants *cannot* be denim. The inverse says that if the pants *are* denim, then the shirt *cannot* be cotton.\n\nWhile they seem similar, they are not always true together.  Consider a scenario where the shirt is silk and the pants are linen.  The original statement holds true (silk is not cotton, so the pants not being denim doesn't matter), but the inverse is false (the pants are not denim, but the shirt is not cotton).\n\n**Answer:** \nno \n\n\n",
