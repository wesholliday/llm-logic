            "content": "\n\nExplanation: \nThis question tests our understanding of logical implication and its inverse. \n\n* **Original Statement:** \"If the car was red, then the truck was not blue.\"  This can be represented symbolically as:  \n    *  p \u2192 \u00acq  (where p = \"the car was red\" and q = \"the truck was blue\")\n\n* **Inverse Statement:** \"If the truck was blue, then the car was not red.\" This can be represented as:\n    * q \u2192 \u00acp\n\n* **Relationship:** The original statement and its inverse are not logically equivalent.  The original statement says that if the car is red, then the truck cannot be blue. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the truck *is* blue.  \n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine a scenario where the car is green and the truck is blue. This satisfies the original statement (the car wasn't red, so the truck could be blue), but it violates the inverse statement (the truck is blue, but the car wasn't red).\n\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
