            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nThis question tests our understanding of logical implication and its inverse. \n\n* **Original Statement:** If the alien visited Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter.  This can be represented symbolically as:  \n   *  P \u2192 \u00acQ \n   where P = \"The alien visited Mars\" and Q = \"The robot visited Jupiter\".\n\n* **Inverse Statement:** If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars. This can be represented as:\n   * Q \u2192 \u00acP\n\n* **Relationship:** The original statement and its inverse are not logically equivalent.  The original statement says that if P is true, then Q must be false. The inverse says that if Q is true, then P must be false. These are not always the same.\n\n**Counterexample:**\n\nImagine a scenario where neither the alien nor the robot visited either planet.  In this case, both the original statement and its inverse would be true (because the condition for the implication is not met). However, this doesn't mean they are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
