            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nThis question tests our understanding of logical implication and its inverse. \n\n* **Original Statement:** If Jeff played basketball, then Amy did not play tennis. This can be represented symbolically as:  P \u2192 \u00acQ (where P = Jeff played basketball, Q = Amy played tennis).\n\n* **Inverse Statement:** If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball. This can be represented as: Q \u2192 \u00acP.\n\n* **Relationship:** The original statement and its inverse are not logically equivalent.  The original statement tells us something about what happens when Jeff plays basketball. The inverse flips the roles of Jeff and Amy, and doesn't necessarily follow the same truth conditions.\n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine a scenario where neither Jeff nor Amy played any sports. The original statement would be true (because the antecedent, Jeff playing basketball, is false). However, the inverse would be false (because the antecedent, Amy playing tennis, is false).\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
