The contrapositive has the form \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n**Key Point:** A statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they always have the same truth value. If one is true, the other is also true. If one is false, the other is also false.\n\nTherefore, since the original statement is given, we can infer that its contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
