The original statement asserts that if Lisa buys the red shirt, Mark *cannot* buy the blue shirt.  The inverse, however, asserts that if Mark buys the blue shirt, Lisa *cannot* buy the red shirt. These are not necessarily the same thing.\n\nConsider a scenario where neither Lisa nor Mark bought either shirt.  The original statement would be true (because the condition for Mark not buying the blue shirt is met, even though Lisa didn't buy the red shirt). However, the inverse would also be true in this scenario (because neither Lisa nor Mark bought the red or blue shirt).\n\n**Therefore, we cannot definitively infer the inverse from the original statement.**\n\nAnswer: no \n",
