The original statement tells us something about what happens when the apple is red. The inverse makes a claim about what happens when the banana is yellow.  There's no guarantee that the relationship holds in the opposite direction.\n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine a scenario where the apple is green and the banana is yellow. This satisfies the original statement (green apple doesn't imply not yellow banana), but it violates the inverse statement (yellow banana doesn't imply not red apple).\n\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
