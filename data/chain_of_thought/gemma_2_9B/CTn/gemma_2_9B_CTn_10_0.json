It says that if a certain condition (the dog being inside) is true, then another condition (the cat not being outside) must also be true.  \n\nNow, to see if we can reverse this logic, we need to consider the opposite of each condition.  If the dog was *not* inside, what can we say about the cat?  The original statement doesn't tell us anything about the cat's location if the dog is outside.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively say that if the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
