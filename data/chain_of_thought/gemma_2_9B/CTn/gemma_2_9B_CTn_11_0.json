            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nThis question tests our understanding of logical implication and its inverse. \n\n* **Original Statement:** \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\"  This can be represented symbolically as:  C \u2192 \u00acB (where C = cake is chocolate, B = muffins are blueberry)\n\n* **Inverse Statement:** \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\" This can be represented as: B \u2192 \u00acC\n\n* **Relationship:** The original statement and its inverse are not logically equivalent.  The original statement tells us something about what happens when the cake is chocolate. The inverse makes a claim about what happens when the muffins are blueberry.  \n\nWhile there might be a correlation, the original statement doesn't provide enough information to guarantee the truth of the inverse.  \n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine a scenario where the cake is vanilla and the muffins are blueberry. The original statement is true (since the cake wasn't chocolate), but the inverse is false (since the cake wasn't chocolate).\n\n\n\nAnswer: \nno",
