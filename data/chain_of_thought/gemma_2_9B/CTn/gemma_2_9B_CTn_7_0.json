The original statement tells us something about what happens when Alex finishes. It doesn't directly tell us anything about what happens when Chris finishes.\n\nFor example, imagine a scenario where Alex and Chris are running separate races. Alex might finish his race, and Chris might not, but that doesn't mean that if Chris finishes his race, Alex automatically wouldn't finish his.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
