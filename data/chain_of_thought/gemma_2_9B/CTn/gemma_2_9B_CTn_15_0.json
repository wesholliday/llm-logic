            "content": "\n\nExplanation: \nThis question tests our understanding of logical implication and its inverse. \n\n* **Original Statement:** If Sam took a plane, then Erin did not take a train.  This can be represented symbolically as P -> ~Q, where P is \"Sam took a plane\" and Q is \"Erin took a train.\"\n\n* **Inverse Statement:** If Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane. This can be represented as Q -> ~P.\n\n* **Relationship:** The original statement and its inverse are not logically equivalent.  The original statement tells us something about the relationship when Sam takes a plane. The inverse makes a claim about the relationship when Erin takes a train.  \n\n* **Counterexample:**  Imagine a scenario where Sam took a bus and Erin took a train. This satisfies the original statement (Sam didn't take a plane, so Erin could have taken a train). However, it does *not* satisfy the inverse (Erin took a train, but we don't know if Sam took a plane).\n\nAnswer: no \n",
