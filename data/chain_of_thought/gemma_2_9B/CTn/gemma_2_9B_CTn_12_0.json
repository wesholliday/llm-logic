This can be represented symbolically as P -> ~Q, where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\n* **Inverse Statement:** If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park. This can be represented as Q -> ~P.\n\n* **Relationship:** The original statement and its inverse are not always logically equivalent.  The original statement tells us that if Joe goes to the park, Lucy *cannot* go to the zoo. It doesn't say anything about what happens if Lucy *does* go to the zoo.  There could be other reasons why Joe might not go to the park even if Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
