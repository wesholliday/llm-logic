            "content": "\n\nExplanation: \nThis question tests our understanding of logical implication and its inverse. \n\n* **Original statement:** \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\" This can be represented symbolically as P \u2192 \u00acQ, where P is \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q is \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\n* **Inverse statement:** \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\" This can be represented as Q \u2192 \u00acP.\n\n* **Key point:** The original statement and its inverse are not always logically equivalent.  The original statement tells us something about what happens when Sue chooses pizza. It doesn't necessarily tell us anything about what happens when Bob chooses pasta.\n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine a scenario where Sue chose salad and Bob chose pasta. This satisfies the original statement (Sue didn't choose pizza, so Bob could have chosen pasta), but it violates the inverse statement (Bob chose pasta, but Sue didn't choose pizza).\n\n\n\nAnswer: \nno",
