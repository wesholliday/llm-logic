The original statement is a conditional statement, meaning it asserts a relationship between two propositions.  \n\nLet's break down the original statement:\n\n* **Hypothesis:** The doll was plastic.\n* **Conclusion:** The truck was not metal.\n\nThe question asks if we can reverse this relationship and conclude the opposite.  \n\nLet's analyze the potential reversal:\n\n* **Hypothesis:** The truck was metal.\n* **Conclusion:** The doll was not plastic.\n\nNotice that the original statement doesn't guarantee that if the truck *is* metal, the doll *must* be non-plastic.  It only states that if the doll *is* plastic, the truck *cannot* be metal.  These are not logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
