            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nThis question asks about the logical relationship between two conditional statements.  The original statement is:\n\n* **Premise:** If the book was written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nWe want to know if the following statement is a valid inference from the premise:\n\n* **Conclusion:** If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\n\nThese statements are logically related through the concept of **contrapositive**. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Original Statement:** If P, then Q (If the book was written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel)\n\n2. **Contrapositive:** If not Q, then not P (If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James)\n\nNotice that the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.  \n\nThe question asks if the conclusion is a valid inference from the premise.  Since the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, it is indeed a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
