This can be represented symbolically as:  P \u2192 \u00acQ (where P = Mary was at the wedding, Q = Sue was at the wedding)\n\n* **Contrapositive Statement:** If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding. This can be represented symbolically as: Q \u2192 \u00acP\n\n* **Key Concept:** In logic, the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\n* **Applying the Concept:** Since the original statement is given, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
