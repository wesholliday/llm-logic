If P, then Q.\n2. Not P.\n3. Therefore, not Q.\n\nLet's break down the given statements and see how they fit:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled. (This is our \"If P, then Q\" statement)\n* **Premise 2:** The flugel was not blimmed. (This is our \"Not P\" statement)\n\nSince we have both premises of a Modus Tollens argument, we can apply the rule of inference and conclude:\n\n* **Conclusion:** Therefore, the flugel was not zargled. (This is our \"Not Q\" statement)\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
