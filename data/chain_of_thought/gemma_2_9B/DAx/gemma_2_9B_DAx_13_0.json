(This is a conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** The glip was not slogged.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nWe're dealing with a conditional statement, which has the form \"If P, then Q\".  Here:\n\n* P: The glip was slogged.\n* Q: The glip was tragged.\n\nThe key to understanding conditional statements is that they don't say anything about what happens when P is *false*. They only tell us what happens *if* P is true.\n\nSince we know the glip was *not* slogged (Premise 2), we can't apply the conditional statement.  The \"if\" part of the statement is not met.  Therefore, we can't conclude anything about whether or not the glip was tragged.\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
