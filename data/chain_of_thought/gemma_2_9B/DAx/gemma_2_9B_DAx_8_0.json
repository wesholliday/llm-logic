Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that follows this pattern:\n\n1. **If P, then Q.** (Hypothetical statement)\n2. **Not P.** (Negation of the antecedent)\n3. **Therefore, not Q.** (Negation of the consequent)\n\nLet's break down how it applies to our example:\n\n* **P:** The sprocket was cranked.\n* **Q:** The sprocket was daggled.\n\n* **Statement 1:** \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\"  This is our hypothetical statement (If P, then Q).\n* **Statement 2:** \"The sprocket was not cranked.\" This is the negation of the antecedent (Not P).\n\nFollowing the structure of Modus Tollens, we can conclude:\n\n* **Therefore, the sprocket was not daggled.** (Not Q)\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
