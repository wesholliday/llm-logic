Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that states:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down our problem:\n\n* **P:** The fribble was snurgled.\n* **Q:** The fribble crinked.\n\nWe are given:\n\n* **If P, then Q:**  \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\"\n* **Not Q:** \"The fribble was not snurgled.\"\n\nApplying Modus Tollens, since we know the fribble was not snurgled (not P), we can conclude that the fribble did not crink (not Q).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
