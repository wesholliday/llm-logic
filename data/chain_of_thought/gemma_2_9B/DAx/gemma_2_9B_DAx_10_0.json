(P -> Q)\n2. **Premise 2:** The wug was not sproinged. (Not P)\n\nWe want to determine if we can conclude:\n\n3. **Conclusion:** The wug was not garpled. (Not Q)\n\nNotice that the conclusion is the opposite of what we'd expect from a direct application of modus ponens.  Modus tollens works by *negating* the consequent (Q) and then *negating* the antecedent (P).\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n\n\n",
