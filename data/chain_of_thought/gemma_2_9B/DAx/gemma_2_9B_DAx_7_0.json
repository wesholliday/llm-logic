Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that follows this pattern:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If P, then Q.\n* **Premise 2:** Not P.\n* **Conclusion:** Therefore, not Q.\n\nLet's break down how it applies to our example:\n\n* **P:** The whiffle was shanked.\n* **Q:** The whiffle tinked.\n\n* **Premise 1:** If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked. (If P, then Q)\n* **Premise 2:** The whiffle was not shanked. (Not P)\n\nFollowing the structure of Modus Tollens, the conclusion must be:\n\n* **Conclusion:** Therefore, the whiffle did not tink.
