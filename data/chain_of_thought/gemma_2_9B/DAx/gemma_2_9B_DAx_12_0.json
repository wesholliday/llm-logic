It means that if the first part (the smip being shripped) is true, then the second part (the smip lupping the zoint) must also be true.\n\n* **Premise 2:** \"The smip was not shripped.\" This is a negation of the first part of the conditional statement.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can conclude \"The smip did not lup the zoint.\"  \n\nSince the first premise tells us that lupping the zoint is a consequence *only if* the smip was shripped, and we know the smip was *not* shripped, we can conclude that lupping the zoint did not happen.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
