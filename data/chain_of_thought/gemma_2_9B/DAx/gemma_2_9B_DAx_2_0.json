(P -> Q)\n2. **Premise 2:** The wug was not flooped. (Not P)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer:\n\n* **Conclusion:** The wug did not bim the zoint. (Not Q)\n\nApplying modus tollens, we see that Premise 2 (Not P) directly contradicts the antecedent (P) of the conditional statement in Premise 1.  Therefore, we can conclude that the consequent (Q) must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
