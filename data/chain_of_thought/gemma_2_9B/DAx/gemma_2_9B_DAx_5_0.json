It tells us that if one thing is true (fraggled), then another thing must also be true (smoogled).\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The zinger was not fraggled.\" This is a negative statement, directly contradicting the \"if\" part of our conditional statement.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \"The zinger was not smoogled.\" This is what we're trying to determine.\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of logic:\n\n* **Modus Tollens:** This is a valid argument form that applies to conditional statements. It states: If \"If P then Q\" is true, and \"not P\" is true, then \"not Q\" must also be true.\n\n* **Applying Modus Tollens:** In our case:\n    * P = \"The zinger was fraggled\"\n    * Q = \"The zinger was smoogled\"\n\nSince we know \"not P\" (the zinger was not fraggled) is true, and the first premise (\"If P then Q\") is also true, then \"not Q\" (the zinger was not smoogled) must also be true.\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
