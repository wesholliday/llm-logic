            "content": "\\\nI need a step-by-step explanation.\n\nExplanation: \nThis is a classic example of a logical argument structure known as Modus Tollens.  \n\nModus Tollens works like this:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** If P, then Q. (In our case, \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed\")\n2. **Premise 2:** Not P. (In our case, \"The flug was not blummed\")\n\n3. **Conclusion:** Therefore, not Q. (In our case, \"The flug was not zimmed\")\n\nLet's break down why this works:\n\n* **Premise 1** sets up a conditional relationship. It says that if a certain event (blummed) happens, then another event (zimmed) must also happen.\n* **Premise 2** tells us that the first event (blummed) *did not* happen.\n* Since the first event didn't happen, the second event (zimmed) cannot happen either, according to the rule set by Premise 1.\n\nAnswer: yes \n\n\n",
