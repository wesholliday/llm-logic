If P, then Q (conditional statement)\n2. P (affirmation of the antecedent)\n\nThen we can conclude that Q (affirmation of the consequent) is true.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The dog was inside\n* Q: The cat was outside\n\nWe are given:\n\n1. If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside (If P, then Q)\n2. The cat was outside (P)\n\nTherefore, according to Modus Ponens, we can conclude that the dog was inside.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
