If P, then Q (where P and Q are propositions)\n2. P is true\n\nThen we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: Alex finished the race\n* Q: Chris finished the race\n\nWe are given:\n\n* If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race (Premise 1)\n* Chris finished the race (Premise 2)\n\nSince both premises are true, according to Modus Ponens, we can conclude that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
