If P, then Q (where P and Q are propositions)\n2. P is true\n\nThen we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: Ben ate pasta\n* Q: Kate ate salad\n\nWe are given:\n\n* If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad (Premise 1)\n* Kate ate salad (Premise 2)\n\nSince Premise 2 (Kate ate salad) matches Q in our Modus Ponens structure, and Premise 1 tells us that if P (Ben ate pasta) is true, then Q (Kate ate salad) is also true, we can conclude that P (Ben ate pasta) must also be true. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
