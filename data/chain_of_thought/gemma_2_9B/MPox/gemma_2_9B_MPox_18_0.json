The second premise establishes a conditional relationship: if the shank was plooked, a certain consequence (being nugged) follows.\n\nSince the first premise is true, and the second premise sets up a direct link between being plooked and being nugged, we can logically conclude that the shank must have been nugged.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
