In our case:\n    * P: The dreb was vroombed.\n    * Q: The dreb was spened.\n\n2. **Analyze the premises:**\n    * Premise 1 states that P (the dreb was vroombed) is true.\n    * Premise 2 states that if P is true, then Q (the dreb was spened) is also true.\n\n3. **Apply deductive reasoning:** Since we know P is true, and Premise 2 tells us that if P is true, then Q must also be true, we can logically conclude that Q is true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
