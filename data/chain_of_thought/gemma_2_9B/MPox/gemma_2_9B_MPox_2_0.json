Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, then we can conclude that the consequent (Q) is also true.\n\n1. **Identify the statements:**\n   - Statement 1: \"The wug was flooped\" (P)\n   - Statement 2: \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint\" (If P, then Q)\n\n2. **Check if the antecedent is true:** Statement 1 tells us that the wug was indeed flooped.\n\n3. **Apply modus ponens:** Since the antecedent (P) is true in Statement 1, and we have the conditional statement (If P, then Q), we can conclude that the consequent (Q) is also true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The wug bimmed the zoint\".\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
