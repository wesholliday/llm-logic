If P, then Q (conditional statement)\n2. P (affirmation of the antecedent)\n\nThen we can conclude:\n\nQ (affirmation of the consequent)\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The sprocket was cranked\n* Q: The sprocket was daggled\n\nWe are given:\n\n1. If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled. (P -> Q)\n2. The sprocket was cranked. (P)\n\nSince both premises are true, according to Modus Ponens, we can conclude:\n\nThe sprocket was daggled. (Q)\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
