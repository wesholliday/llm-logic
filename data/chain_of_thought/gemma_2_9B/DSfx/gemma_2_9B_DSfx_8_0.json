(This is a disjunction - it means one or the other must be true)\n   *  Premise 2: The sprocket is not daggled.\n\n2. **Applying the Negation:** Since we know the sprocket is *not* daggled, we can eliminate the first part of the disjunction (the sprocket being daggled) as a possibility.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**  This leaves us with only one option remaining from the original disjunction: the sprocket must be cranked.\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
