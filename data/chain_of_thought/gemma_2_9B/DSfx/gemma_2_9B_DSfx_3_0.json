(This is a disjunction)\n* **Premise 2:** The splat is not quanked. (This is a negation)\n\nSince the first premise states that the splat must be either quanked or morphed, and the second premise tells us it's not quanked, the only remaining possibility is that the splat must be morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
