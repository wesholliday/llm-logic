It states that the wug must be either bimmed or flooped, but not both.\n    * Premise 2 negates the first part of the disjunction, stating that the wug is not bimmed.\n\n3. **Apply logic:**\n    * Since the wug cannot be bimmed (Premise 2), the only remaining option from the disjunction in Premise 1 is that the wug must be flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
