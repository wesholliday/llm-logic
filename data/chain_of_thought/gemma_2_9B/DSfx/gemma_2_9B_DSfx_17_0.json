(This is a disjunction, meaning one or the other must be true, but not both)\n* **Premise 2:** The flob is not movated. (This negates the first part of the disjunction)\n\nSince we know the flob is not movated, the only remaining option from the disjunction is that it must be skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
