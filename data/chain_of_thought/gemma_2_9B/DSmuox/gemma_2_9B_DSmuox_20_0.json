This satisfies Statement 2.\n\n* **Possibility 2:** The fleeg is not bluttered.  If this is true, Statement 2 tells us it *must* be surned. But Statement 1 says the fleeg doesn't *have* to be surned. This creates a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility that works is that the fleeg must be bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
