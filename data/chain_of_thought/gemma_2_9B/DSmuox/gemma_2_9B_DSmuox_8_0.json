It could be something else or nothing at all.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled.\" This presents a disjunction: the sprocket is either cranked OR it must be daggled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship:\n\n* Statement 1 tells us daggling is not a requirement.\n* Statement 2 says daggling is the *only* other option if it's not cranked.\n\nSince Statement 1 removes the necessity of daggling, and Statement 2 says daggling is the *only* alternative to cranking, the only remaining possibility is that the sprocket *must* be cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
