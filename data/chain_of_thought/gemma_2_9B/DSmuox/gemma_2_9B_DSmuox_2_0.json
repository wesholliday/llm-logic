It could be something else.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the wug is flooped or it must be bimmed.\" This presents a disjunction: the wug is either flooped, or it has to be bimmed.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship:\n\n* Statement 1 tells us bimming is not a requirement for the wug.\n* Statement 2 says the wug *must* be either flooped or bimmed.\n\nSince bimming isn't mandatory (Statement 1), the only way for Statement 2 to be true is if the wug is flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
