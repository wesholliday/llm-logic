It could be something else.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked.\" This presents a disjunction: the fribble is either snurgled or crinked (or both).\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship:\n\n* Statement 1 tells us crinked is not a requirement for the fribble.\n* Statement 2 says the fribble *must* be either snurgled or crinked.\n\nSince the fribble doesn't *have* to be crinked (Statement 1), the only remaining option from Statement 2 is that it must be snurgled.\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
