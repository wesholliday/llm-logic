It could be something else.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated.\" This presents a disjunction: the flob is either skizzled, or it has to be movated.\n\nNow, let's see if we can combine these:\n\n* Since the flob doesn't *have* to be movated (Statement 1), and it *must* be either skizzled or movated (Statement 2), the only remaining possibility is that the flob must be skizzled. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
