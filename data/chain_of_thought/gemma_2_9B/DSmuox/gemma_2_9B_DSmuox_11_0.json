It means one of two things must be true: either the flug is blummed, or it must be zimmed.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship:\n\n* If the flug is not necessarily zimmed (Statement 1), and the flug must be either blummed or zimmed (Statement 2), then the only remaining possibility is that the flug must be blummed.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n\n\n",
