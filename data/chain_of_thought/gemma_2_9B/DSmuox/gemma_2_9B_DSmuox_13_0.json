It means one of two things must be true: either the glip is slogged, or the glip is tragged.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship:\n\n* Statement 1 tells us the glip doesn't *have* to be tragged.\n* Statement 2 says the glip *must* be either slogged or tragged.\n\nSince the glip can't be tragged (according to Statement 1), the only option left from Statement 2 is that the glip must be slogged.\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
