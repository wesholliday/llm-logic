It could be something else.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled.\" This presents a disjunction: the wug must be either sproinged or garpled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship:\n\n* Statement 1 tells us garpling is not a necessity for the wug.\n* Statement 2 says the wug *must* be either sproinged or garpled.\n\nSince garpling isn't mandatory, the only option left to satisfy Statement 2 is for the wug to be sproinged. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
