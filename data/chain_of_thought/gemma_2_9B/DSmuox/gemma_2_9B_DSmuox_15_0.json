It could be something else or nothing at all.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"Either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened.\"** This statement presents a disjunction. It says that the dreb must be either vroombed or spened, there are no other options.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n* If the dreb *must* be spened (as Statement 2 suggests), then Statement 1 contradicts this. \n* Therefore, the dreb cannot *must* be spened.\n\nThis leaves us with the only remaining option from Statement 2: the dreb *must* be vroombed.\n\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
