It could be something else.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged.\" This presents a disjunction: the smonk is either vreebled or it has to be plagged.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship:\n\n* If the smonk *must* be plagged (as Statement 2 suggests), then Statement 1 contradicts this. \n* Therefore, the smonk cannot *must* be plagged.\n\nThis leaves us with the only remaining option from Statement 2: the smonk *must* be vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
