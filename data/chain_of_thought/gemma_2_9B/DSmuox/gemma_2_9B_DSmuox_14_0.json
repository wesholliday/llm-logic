It could be something else.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the clug is fleeked or it must be snugged.\" This presents a disjunction: the clug is either fleeked OR it must be snugged.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that the clug is fleeked.  \n\nSince Statement 1 says the clug doesn't *have* to be snugged, and Statement 2 says it *must* be either fleeked or snugged, the only remaining possibility is that the clug must be fleeked.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n\n\n",
