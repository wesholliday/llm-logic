It could be something else.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked.\" This presents a disjunction: the splat is either morphed, or it *must* be quanked (meaning there's no other option).\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship:\n\n* If the splat *must* be quanked (as per statement 2), then statement 1 contradicts it. \n* Therefore, the splat cannot *must* be quanked. This means the splat must be morphed (since statement 2 says it's either morphed or must be quanked).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
