It means one of two things must be true: either the smip is shripped, or it must be lupped.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship:\n\n* If the smip is lupped, Statement 1 is false (because it says the smip is *not* necessarily lupped).\n* If the smip is not lupped, Statement 2 forces us to conclude that it must be shripped.\n\nTherefore, the only way to satisfy both statements is if the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes \n\n\n",
