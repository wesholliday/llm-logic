The first statement, \"The crunk must be blimp wobble,\" asserts a necessary condition for something to be crunk.  It doesn't say anything about other qualities it might have. The second statement, \"The crunk must be blimp wobble and zibble at quank wump,\" adds an additional condition, \"zibble at quank wump.\"  \n\nSince the first statement doesn't mention \"zibble at quank wump,\" we can't infer that it's also a necessary condition for being crunk.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
