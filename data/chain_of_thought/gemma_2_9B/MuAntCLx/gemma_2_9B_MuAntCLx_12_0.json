The first statement, \"The grooble must be grazzle by grooble,\" asserts a necessary condition for something to be a grooble. It states that being grazzled by a grooble is essential for grooble-ness.\n\nThe second statement, \"The grooble must be grazzle by grooble and be wozzle flump,\" adds an additional condition: being wozzle flump.  \n\nSince the first statement doesn't mention anything about being wozzle flump, we can't infer that it's a necessary condition for being a grooble. \n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
