The first statement, \"The zibble must be wozzle zump,\" asserts a necessary condition for the zibble. It states that \"wozzle zump\" is a requirement for the zibble's existence or definition.\n\nThe second statement, \"The zibble must be wozzle zump and frazzle wozzle wibble,\" adds an additional condition to the zibble's definition.  \n\nSince the first statement only specifies that the zibble *must* be \"wozzle zump,\" it doesn't say anything about whether it *must also* be \"frazzle wozzle wibble.\"  \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
