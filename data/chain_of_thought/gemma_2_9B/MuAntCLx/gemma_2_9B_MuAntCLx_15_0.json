This means that \"zibber flim wumble\" is a necessary condition for something to be a zizz.  The second statement says \"The zizz must be zibber flim wumble and flimble a zibble\". This means that \"zibber flim wumble\" and \"flimble a zibble\" are both necessary conditions for something to be a zizz.\n\nSince the first statement only requires \"zibber flim wumble\" to be a zizz, it doesn't necessarily mean that \"flimble a zibble\" is also required.  \n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
