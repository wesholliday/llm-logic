Here's why:\n\n* **Limited Information:** The original statement only tells us about the relationship between 'wibble' and 'frazzle' in the context of a 'quibble'. It doesn't provide any information about 'zibber'.\n\n* **No Logical Connection:** There's no logical connection established between 'frazzle' and 'zibber'.  The statement doesn't suggest that 'frazzle' implies or necessitates 'zibber'.\n\nTherefore, adding 'and be zibber' to the original statement is an unwarranted assumption. \n\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
