The first statement, \"The bimboozle must be on the plonk,\" asserts a necessary condition: if the bimboozle is to exist in a certain state, it must be on the plonk.  The second statement, \"The bimboozle must be on the plonk and froodle a wobble quank,\" adds an additional condition: the bimboozle must also froodle a wobble quank.\n\nSince the first statement doesn't mention anything about froodling a wobble quank, we can't infer that it must also be true.  The two statements are not logically connected.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
