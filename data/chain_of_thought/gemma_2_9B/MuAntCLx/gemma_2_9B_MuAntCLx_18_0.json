It states that \"quork with floob\" is essential for something to be a \"shimble.\"\n\nThe second statement, \"The shimble must be quork with floob and be fizzle zizz shimble,\" adds an additional condition: \"be fizzle zizz shimble.\"\n\nSince the first statement only specifies that \"quork with floob\" is necessary, it doesn't say anything about whether or not a shimble must also be \"fizzle zizz.\"  \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the second statement is true from the first statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
