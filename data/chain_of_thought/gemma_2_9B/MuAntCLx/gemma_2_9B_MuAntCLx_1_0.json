The first statement, \"The zizz must be wump,\" asserts that \"wump\" is a necessary condition for something to be a \"zizz.\"  The second statement, \"The zizz must be wump and quank a glorp,\" asserts that \"wump\" and \"quank a glorp\" are both necessary conditions for something to be a zizz.\n\nSince the first statement only requires \"wump\" to be true, it doesn't necessarily mean that \"quank a glorp\" must also be true.  \n\nAnswer: no \n",
