            "content": "\n\nExplanation: \nThis question tests our understanding of logical implication.  \n\n* **Original Statement:** If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. This can be represented symbolically as:  Shirt (C) \u2192 Pants (D)\n\n* **Reverse Logic:** We want to know if the reverse is also true: If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton. This would be represented as: Pants (D) \u2192 Shirt (C)\n\n* **The Problem:**  Logical implication doesn't always work in reverse. The original statement tells us something about a *conditional* relationship. It says that *if* a shirt is cotton, *then* the pants must be denim. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the pants *are* denim.  There could be other reasons why the pants are denim.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
