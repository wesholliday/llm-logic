This is a conditional statement, meaning it proposes a cause-and-effect relationship.\n\n* **Inverse Statement:**  The inverse of a conditional statement flips both the hypothesis (the \"if\" part) and the conclusion (the \"then\" part). In this case, the inverse would be: If Joe did *not* go to the park, then Lucy did *not* go to the zoo.\n\n* **The Problem:** The original statement doesn't tell us anything about what happens if Lucy goes to the zoo. It only tells us what happens if Joe goes to the park.  We can't assume a reverse relationship.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
