            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nThis is a classic logic problem that deals with the concept of logical equivalence.  \n\n* **Original Statement:** If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This can be represented symbolically as: V \u2192 M (where V = Vampire awake, M = Mummy awake)\n\n* **Desired Conclusion:** If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake. This can be represented as: M \u2192 V\n\n* **The Key:**  The original statement does *not* guarantee the reverse is true.  \n\nThink of it this way:\n\n* It's possible for the mummy to be awake for reasons unrelated to the vampire.  Maybe there's a full moon, or a special ritual.\n\n*  The original statement only tells us that if the vampire is awake, the mummy *must* also be awake. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the mummy is awake without the vampire.\n\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
