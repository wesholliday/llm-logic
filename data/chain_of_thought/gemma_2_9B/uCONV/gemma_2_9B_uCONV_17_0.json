(This is a conditional statement, often written as \"If P, then Q\")\n\n* **Fallacy:**  The problem is assuming that because Kate ate salad (Q), Ben must have eaten pasta (P).  \n\n* **Counter-Example:**  It's entirely possible that Kate ate salad for some other reason, and Ben didn't eat pasta at all.\n\n**Answer:** \nno \n\n\n",
