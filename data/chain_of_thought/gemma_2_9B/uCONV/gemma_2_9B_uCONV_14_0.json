This can be represented symbolically as:\n\n   B \u2192 W (where B = bear in the cave, W = wolf in the den)\n\n* **Reverse Statement:** If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the cave. This can be represented as:\n\n   W \u2192 B\n\n* **Logical Equivalence:**  The original statement does *not* guarantee the truth of the reverse statement.  \n\n   For example, imagine a scenario where the bear is never in the cave. In this case, the original statement is still true (because the \"if\" part is never met). However, the reverse statement would be false (since the \"if\" part could be true, but the \"then\" part wouldn't be).\n\n**Answer:** no \n",
