This can be represented symbolically as:  Car(red) \u2192 Truck(blue)\n\n* **Reverse Logic:** We want to know if the reverse is also true: If the truck was blue, then the car was red. This can be represented as: Truck(blue) \u2192 Car(red)\n\n* **The Problem:**  Logical implication doesn't always work in reverse. The original statement tells us something about what happens *when* the car is red. It doesn't say anything about what happens *when* the truck is blue.  There could be other reasons why the truck might be blue.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
