This is a conditional statement (if P, then Q).\n\n* **Inverse Statement:** If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.  \n\nThe original statement does *not* guarantee that the inverse statement is also true.  Here's why:\n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine a scenario where Mary wasn't invited to the wedding, but Sue was invited by someone else.  In this case, Sue could be at the wedding, but Mary wouldn't be.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
