This can be represented as \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"Alex finished the race\" and Q is \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\n* **Reverse Logic:** We are asked if the reverse is also true: If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race. This would be represented as \"If Q, then P.\"\n\n* **Contrapositive:**  The key here is to understand that the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\n* **Relationship:**  While the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, the converse (If Q, then P) is not necessarily true.\n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine a scenario where Alex is training for a race, but Chris is just there to cheer him on. If Alex finishes, Chris might be happy and celebrate, but his presence doesn't guarantee Alex will finish.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
