This can be represented symbolically as P -> Q (where P is Lisa buying the red shirt and Q is Mark buying the blue shirt).\n\n* **Reverse statement:** If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt. This can be represented as Q -> P.\n\n* **Logical Equivalence:**  The original statement and its reverse are not logically equivalent.  The original statement only tells us something about what happens *if* Lisa buys the red shirt. It doesn't say anything about what happens if Mark buys the blue shirt.  There could be other reasons why Mark might buy the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
