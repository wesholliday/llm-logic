This is a conditional statement, meaning it proposes a cause-and-effect relationship.\n\n* **Inverse Statement:** If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza. This is the inverse of the original statement. It flips both the hypothesis (Sue chose pizza) and the conclusion (Bob chose pasta).\n\n* **Key Point:** The inverse of a conditional statement is not always logically equivalent to the original statement.  Just because one thing happens (Sue choosing pizza) doesn't necessarily mean the other thing will always happen (Bob choosing pasta).\n\nIn this case, we can't be sure if Bob choosing pasta means Sue chose pizza. There could be other scenarios where Bob chooses pasta without Sue choosing pizza.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
