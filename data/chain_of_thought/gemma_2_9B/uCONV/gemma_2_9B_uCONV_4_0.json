Just because the ground is wet (Q) doesn't mean it *must* have been raining (P). There could be other reasons for the ground to be wet (sprinklers, a burst pipe, etc.).\n\n**In this case, there could be other reasons why the robot visited Jupiter besides the alien visiting Mars.**\n\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
