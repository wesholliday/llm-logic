This is a conditional statement. It tells us something about the relationship between two events: when the first event (apple being red) happens, the second event (banana being yellow) also happens.\n\n* **Reverse Implication:** We want to know if the reverse is also true: If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red. This is the converse of the original statement.\n\n* **Key Point:** The converse of a conditional statement is not always true. Just because one event happens (banana being yellow) doesn't necessarily mean the other event (apple being red) also happened.\n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine a scenario where there are many fruits, and some apples are red, some are green, and some bananas are yellow, some are green.  The original statement might be true in some cases, but there could be instances where a banana is yellow and the apple is green.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
