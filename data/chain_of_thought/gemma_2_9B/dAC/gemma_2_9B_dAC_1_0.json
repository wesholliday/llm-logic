Modus Ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, then we can conclude that the consequent (Q) is also true.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* P: Mary was at the wedding\n* Q: Sue was at the wedding\n\nWe are given:\n\n* If P, then Q (If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding)\n* Q (Sue was at the wedding)\n\nSince we know Sue was at the wedding (Q is true), and we know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would be there, we can conclude that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n\n\n",
