It says that *if* a certain condition is true (the cake was chocolate), *then* another condition must also be true (the muffins were blueberry).\n\n* **The Flaw:**  We know the muffins were blueberry (the consequent).  However, this doesn't automatically mean the cake *must* have been chocolate (the antecedent). There could be other reasons why the muffins were blueberry.\n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine a scenario where the cake was vanilla, but the baker always makes blueberry muffins. In this case, the consequent is true (blueberry muffins), but the antecedent (chocolate cake) is false.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
