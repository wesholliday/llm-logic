            "content": "\n\nExplanation: \nThis is a classic example of a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **The original statement sets up a conditional relationship:** \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This means that if the first part (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the second part (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\n* **We are given that the second part is true:** \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n* **The fallacy:**  Just because the consequent (Mark buying the blue shirt) is true, it doesn't automatically mean the antecedent (Lisa buying the red shirt) is also true. There could be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine a different scenario:\n\n* If it rains, the ground is wet.\n* The ground is wet.\n\nCan we conclude that it rained?  No! The ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled water, etc.).\n\nAnswer: no \n",
