It says that if a certain condition (Sue choosing pizza) is met, then another condition (Bob choosing pasta) must also be met.  \n\nNow, let's look at the question. It's asking if the opposite of the second condition (Bob not choosing pasta) automatically means the opposite of the first condition (Sue not choosing pizza) is also true.\n\nTo figure this out, we can use a truth table to analyze all possible combinations of truth values for Sue's and Bob's choices.\n\n| Sue Pizza | Bob Pasta | Original Statement |\n|---|---|---|\n| True | True | True |\n| True | False | False |\n| False | True | True |\n| False | False | True |\n\nAs you can see, the original statement is only false when Sue chose pizza but Bob did not choose pasta.  This means the opposite of the original statement is true in this one case.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
