            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nLet's break down the original statement and see how it relates to the question.\n\nThe original statement is a conditional statement. It says that if a certain condition (the dog being inside) is true, then another condition (the cat being outside) must also be true.  \n\nNow, let's look at the question. It's asking if we can infer the opposite of the original statement.  \n\nTo see if this is possible, we can use a concept called the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then reversing their order.\n\n* **Original statement:** If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n* **Contrapositive:** If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside.\n\nNotice that the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
