            "content": "\n\nExplanation: \nThis question tests our understanding of logical implication and its inverse. \n\n* **Original Statement:** \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"  This can be represented symbolically as  A \u2192 B (where A = apple is red, B = banana is yellow).\n\n* **Inverse Statement:** \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\" This can be represented as \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA (where \u00ac represents \"not\").\n\n* **Relationship:** The original statement and its inverse are not logically equivalent.  The original statement says that IF the apple is red, THEN the banana is yellow. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the banana is NOT yellow.  \n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine a scenario where the apple is green and the banana is purple. This satisfies the original statement (apple not red, so the implication doesn't apply), but it violates the inverse statement (banana not yellow, so the apple should not be red).\n\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
