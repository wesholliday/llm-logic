It says that if a certain condition (Joe going to the park) is met, then another condition (Lucy going to the zoo) must also be met.  \n\nNow, let's look at the question. It's asking if we can infer the opposite of the original statement.  The original statement is:\n\n* If P, then Q (If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo)\n\nThe question is asking if we can infer:\n\n* If not Q, then not P (If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park)\n\nThese are logically related, but not necessarily equivalent.  The original statement doesn't tell us anything about what happens if Lucy *doesn't* go to the zoo. It only tells us what happens if she *does*.\n\nThink of it this way: If it's raining, then the ground is wet. This doesn't mean that if the ground isn't wet, then it's not raining. There could be other reasons why the ground isn't wet (like if it's been dry for a while).\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
