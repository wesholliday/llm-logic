            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nLet's break down the original statement and see how it relates to the question.\n\nThe original statement is a conditional statement. It says that if one event (the vampire being awake) happens, then another event (the mummy being awake) must also happen.  \n\nNow, we want to know if the opposite of the second event (the mummy not being awake) automatically means the opposite of the first event (the vampire not being awake) must also be true.\n\nThis is where we run into a problem.  The original statement doesn't tell us anything about what happens if the mummy *isn't* awake. It only tells us what happens if the vampire *is* awake.\n\nThink of it like this: If it's raining (vampire awake), then the ground is wet (mummy awake).  This doesn't mean that if the ground isn't wet (mummy not awake), then it must not be raining (vampire not awake). The ground could be dry for other reasons.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that 'If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake' from the given statement. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
