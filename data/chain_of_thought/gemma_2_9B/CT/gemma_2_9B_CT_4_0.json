The original statement says that IF P is true, THEN Q is true. The inverse says that IF Q is false, THEN P is false. These are different conditions.\n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine a scenario where the alien never visited Mars (P is false) and the robot also never visited Jupiter (Q is false). The original statement wouldn't be violated because the \"if\" part is false. However, the inverse statement would imply that since Q is false, P must also be false, which isn't necessarily true.\n\n\nAnswer: \nno",
