The proposed statement asserts a negative relationship: if Jen does not watch basketball, then Tom *must not* have watched football.\n\nThese are not logically equivalent.  The original statement doesn't tell us anything about what happens if Jen *doesn't* watch basketball. It only tells us what happens if Tom *does* watch football.\n\nFor example, imagine a scenario where Tom didn't watch football at all. In this case, the original statement wouldn't be violated, but the proposed statement would be false (since Tom didn't watch football, and Jen could have watched basketball or not).\n\nAnswer: no \n",
