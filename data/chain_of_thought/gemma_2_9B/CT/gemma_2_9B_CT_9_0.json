It says that if one event (Lisa buying the red shirt) happens, then another event (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also happen.  \n\nNow, let's look at the question. It's asking if the opposite of the second event happening (Mark not buying the blue shirt) means the opposite of the first event happening (Lisa not buying the red shirt).\n\nThis is a classic example of contrapositive reasoning. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* **Original statement:** If P, then Q (If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt)\n* **Contrapositive:** If not Q, then not P (If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt)\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means they always have the same truth value.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
