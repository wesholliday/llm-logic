            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nLet's break down the original statement and see how it relates to the question.\n\nThe original statement is a conditional statement. It says that if a certain condition (Jeff playing basketball) is met, then another condition (Amy playing tennis) must also be met.  \n\nNow, let's look at the question. It's asking if we can infer the opposite of the original statement.  The original statement is:\n\n* If P, then Q (If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis)\n\nThe question is asking if we can infer:\n\n* If not Q, then not P (If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball)\n\nThese are logically related, but not necessarily equivalent.  The original statement doesn't guarantee that if Amy *didn't* play tennis, then Jeff *mustn't* have played basketball. There could be other reasons why Amy didn't play tennis.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
