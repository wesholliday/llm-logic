It says that if a certain condition (Alex finishing the race) is met, then another condition (Chris finishing the race) is also met.  \n\nNow, we want to see if we can logically deduce the opposite of this statement. The opposite of \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A\".\n\nIn our case:\n\n* A = Alex finishing the race\n* B = Chris finishing the race\n\nSo, the opposite of the original statement is \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\"\n\nThis is a classic example of contrapositive reasoning. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.  \n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
