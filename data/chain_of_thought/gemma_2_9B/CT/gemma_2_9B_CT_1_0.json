It says that if a certain condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then another condition (Sue being at the wedding) is also true.  \n\nNow, we want to know if the opposite of the original statement is also true. The opposite of the original statement would be:\n\n* If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nThis is called the contrapositive of the original statement.  \n\nIn logic, the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
