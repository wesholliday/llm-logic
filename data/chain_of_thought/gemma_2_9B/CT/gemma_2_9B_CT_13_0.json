The proposed inference asserts a negative relationship: if the truck is not blue, then the car is not red. These are logically related through the concept of contrapositive.\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order.  \n\nLet's apply this to our statements:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n* **Contrapositive:** If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\n\nAs you can see, the proposed inference is indeed the contrapositive of the original statement.  \n\nIn logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
