            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nThis is a classic example of a logical argument called the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order. \n\nLet's break down the original statement:\n\n* **Hypothesis:** Ben ate pasta.\n* **Conclusion:** Kate ate the salad.\n\nNow, let's form the contrapositive:\n\n* **Negated Hypothesis:** Ben did not eat pasta.\n* **Negated Conclusion:** Kate did not eat the salad.\n* **Reversed Order:** If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\n\n**Therefore, the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.**\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
