It says that if a certain condition (the griffin being in the forest) is true, then another condition (the unicorn being in the forest) is also true.  \n\nThe question asks us if we can infer a converse statement. A converse statement flips the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement.  \n\nIn this case, the converse would be: \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nNow, consider this:  A conditional statement and its converse are not always logically equivalent.  Just because one is true doesn't necessarily mean the other is true.\n\nThink of an example:\n\n* If it is raining, then the ground is wet. (Original statement)\n* If the ground is wet, then it is raining. (Converse statement)\n\nThe original statement is true, but the converse is not necessarily true. The ground could be wet for other reasons besides rain.\n\nSimilarly, in our griffin and unicorn example, we can't be sure that if the unicorn is not in the forest, the griffin must also not be there.  There could be other reasons why the griffin might be in the forest even if the unicorn isn't.\n\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
