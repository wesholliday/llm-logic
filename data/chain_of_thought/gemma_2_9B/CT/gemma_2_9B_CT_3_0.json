It says that *if* a certain condition is met (the book was written by James), *then* a certain consequence follows (the book is a mystery novel).  \n\nWe need to determine if the reverse of this conditional statement is also true. The reverse would be: *if* the book is not a mystery novel, *then* the book was not written by James.\n\nThis is where logic comes in.  The original statement doesn't guarantee that *only* James writes mystery novels. There could be other authors who write mystery novels.  \n\nTherefore, just because a book isn't a mystery novel doesn't automatically mean it wasn't written by James. It could have been written by someone else.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
