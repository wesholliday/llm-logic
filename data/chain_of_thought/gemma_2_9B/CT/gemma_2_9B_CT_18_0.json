It says that if one thing is true (the doll being plastic), then another thing must also be true (the truck being metal).  \n\nNow, we want to see if we can flip this around and say that if the truck wasn't metal, then the doll couldn't have been plastic.  \n\nThink about it this way:\n\n* **Original statement:** If P, then Q (If the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal)\n* **Question:** If not Q, then not P (If the truck is not metal, then the doll is not plastic)\n\nThese statements are logically related, but they are not direct opposites. The original statement only tells us something about what happens when the doll *is* plastic. It doesn't tell us anything about what happens when the doll *isn't* plastic.\n\nFor example, the truck could be made of something other than metal even if the doll is not plastic.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
