The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order. \n\nLet's break down the original statement:\n\n* **Hypothesis:** The cake was chocolate.\n* **Conclusion:** The muffins were blueberry.\n\nNow, let's form the contrapositive:\n\n* **Negated Hypothesis:** The cake was not chocolate.\n* **Negated Conclusion:** The muffins were not blueberry.\n* **Reversed Order:** If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of the original statement is indeed \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\".\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
