The original statement is a conditional statement, meaning it has the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is the antecedent (Sam took a plane) and Q is the consequent (Erin took a train).\n\nNow, we want to determine if the converse of this statement is also true. The converse of a conditional statement is formed by swapping the antecedent and consequent. In this case, the converse would be \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\"\n\nHowever, the converse of a conditional statement is not always logically equivalent to the original statement.  \n\nConsider a counterexample:\n\n* If it is raining, then the ground is wet. (Original statement)\n* If the ground is not wet, then it is not raining. (Converse)\n\nThe converse is not always true. The ground could be wet for other reasons besides rain.\n\nSimilarly, in our original statement, there might be other reasons why Sam took a plane even if Erin did not take a train.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane\" from the given information. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
