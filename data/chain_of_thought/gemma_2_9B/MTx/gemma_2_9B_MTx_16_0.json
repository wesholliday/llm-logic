            "content": "\\\nThis is a logic problem involving conditional statements and negation.\n\nExplanation: \n\nLet's break down the statements:\n\n* **Premise 1:** \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\" This is a conditional statement. It means that if the sneg was in a state of being \"crampled,\" then it necessarily followed that the sneg \"sproted\" the frink.\n\n* **Premise 2:** \"The sneg did not sproted the frink.\" This statement directly negates the consequent (the \"then\" part) of the conditional statement.\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can infer \"The sneg was not crampled.\"  This is the contrapositive of the original conditional statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and reversing their order.  \n\nLet's see if the premises lead to the contrapositive:\n\n* **Original Conditional:** If P, then Q.\n* **Contrapositive:** If not Q, then not P.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The sneg was crampled.\n* Q: The sneg sproted the frink.\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive is: If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\n\nSince Premise 2 states that \"The sneg did not sproted the frink,\" we can apply the contrapositive to conclude that \"The sneg was not crampled.\"\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
