            "content": "\\\nI need a step-by-step explanation.\n\nExplanation: \nThis is a classic example of a logical argument known as Modus Tollens. Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that follows this structure:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** If P, then Q.\n2. **Premise 2:** Not Q.\n3. **Conclusion:** Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down how it applies to our example:\n\n* **Premise 1:** \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\"  This can be represented as P -> Q, where P is \"the flugel was blimmed\" and Q is \"the flugel was zargled.\"\n* **Premise 2:** \"The flugel was not zargled.\" This is the negation of Q, or ~Q.\n\n* **Conclusion:** \"Therefore, the flugel was not blimmed.\" This is the negation of P, or ~P.\n\nSince the premises fit the structure of Modus Tollens, and Modus Tollens is a valid argument form, we can logically conclude that if the first two statements are true, then the third statement must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
