Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that states:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down the given statements:\n\n1. **If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.** (P -> Q) This is our hypothesis.\n\n2. **The whiffle did not tink.** (Not Q) This is our observation.\n\nSince Modus Tollens is a valid argument form, and our statements match its structure, we can conclude:\n\n**Answer:** yes \n\n\n",
