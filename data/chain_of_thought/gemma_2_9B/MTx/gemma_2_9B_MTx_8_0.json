Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that states:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The sprocket was cranked.\n* Q: The sprocket was daggled.\n\nWe are given:\n\n* If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled (P -> Q)\n* The sprocket was not daggled (not Q)\n\nTherefore, according to Modus Tollens, we can conclude that:\n\n* The sprocket was not cranked (not P).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
