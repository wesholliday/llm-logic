It means that if the first part (the antecedent) is true (the smonk was vreebled), then the second part (the consequent) must also be true (the smonk plagged).\n\n* **Premise 2:** \"The smonk did not plagged.\" This statement negates the consequent of our first premise.\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can infer that \"The smonk was not vreebled.\"  This is the negation of the antecedent of the first premise.\n\nWe can use a logical rule called *modus tollens* to help us here. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement and the negation of the consequent, we can infer the negation of the antecedent.\n\nApplying modus tollens to our problem:\n\n1. We have the conditional statement: \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\"\n2. We have the negation of the consequent: \"The smonk did not plagged.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer: \"The smonk was not vreebled.\"\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
