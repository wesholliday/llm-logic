It means that if the first part (antecedent) is true (the smip was shripped), then the second part (consequent) must also be true (the smip lupped the zoint).\n\n* **Premise 2:** \"The smip did not lup the zoint.\" This statement directly negates the consequent of our first premise.\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can infer that \"The smip was not shripped.\"  This is the negation of the antecedent of the first premise.\n\nWe can use a logical rule called *modus tollens* to help us here. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement and the negation of the consequent, we can conclude the negation of the antecedent.\n\nApplying modus tollens to our problem:\n\n1. We have the conditional statement: \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint.\"\n2. We have the negation of the consequent: \"The smip did not lup the zoint.\"\n\nTherefore, we can conclude: \"The smip was not shripped.\"\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
