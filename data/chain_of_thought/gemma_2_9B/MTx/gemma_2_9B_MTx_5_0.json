            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nThis is a classic example of a logical argument that can be solved using a technique called *modus tollens*. \n\n* **Modus Tollens** states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know that Q is false, we can conclude that P must also be false.\n\nLet's break down our statements:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled. (This is our conditional statement, where P = \"the zinger was fraggled\" and Q = \"the zinger was smoogled\")\n2. **Premise 2:** The zinger was not smoogled. (This tells us Q is false)\n\nSince we have a conditional statement and the consequent (Q) is false, we can apply modus tollens to conclude that the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
