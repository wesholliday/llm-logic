It can be represented symbolically as:  \n   *  p \u2192 q (where 'p' is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and 'q' is \"the dreb was spened\")\n\n* **\"The dreb was not spened\"** This is a negation of the consequent (q) of our conditional statement:\n   * \u00acq\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The dreb was not vroombed\" (\u00acp).\n\n**Applying Logic:**\n\nWe can use a logical rule called *modus tollens* to solve this. Modus tollens states:\n\nIf we have:\n* p \u2192 q\n* \u00acq\n\nThen we can conclude:\n* \u00acp\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSince our statements match the structure required for modus tollens, we can indeed infer that \"The dreb was not vroombed\". \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
