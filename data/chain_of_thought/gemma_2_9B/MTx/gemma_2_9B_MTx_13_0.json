It states that if a certain condition (being slogged) is true, then a consequence (being tragged) must also be true.\n\n    * Premise 2: \"The glip was not tragged.\" This is a negative statement, directly contradicting the consequence in Premise 1.\n\n* **Step 2: Apply Modus Tollens:**\n\n    Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states:\n\n    If a conditional statement (If P, then Q) is true, and the consequent (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\n    In our case:\n\n    * P: The glip was slogged\n    * Q: The glip was tragged\n\n    Since we know Q (the glip was not tragged) is false, and the conditional statement (Premise 1) is assumed to be true, then P (the glip was slogged) must also be false.\n\n* **Step 3: Conclusion:**\n\n    Therefore, we can infer that \"The glip was not slogged.\"\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes",
