            "content": "\\\nThis is a logic problem involving conditional statements and negation.\n\nExplanation: \n\nLet's break down the statements:\n\n* **Premise 1:** \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\" This is a conditional statement. It means that if the first part (antecedent) is true (the grommet was sploffed), then the second part (consequent) must also be true (the grommet plopped the frink).\n\n* **Premise 2:** \"The grommet did not plop the frink.\" This statement directly negates the consequent of our first premise.\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can infer that the grommet was not sploffed.  We can use a logical rule called *modus tollens* to help us. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement and the negation of the consequent, we can conclude the negation of the antecedent.\n\nApplying modus tollens to our problem:\n\n* **Conditional:** If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\n* **Negation of consequent:** The grommet did not plop the frink.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude: **The grommet was not sploffed.**\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
