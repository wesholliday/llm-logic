It means that if the first part (antecedent) is true, then the second part (consequent) must also be true.\n\n* **Premise 2:** \"The clug did not snugged.\" This is a negation of the consequent in our conditional statement.\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can infer that \"The clug was not fleeked.\" This is the negation of the antecedent.\n\nTo do this, we can use a logical rule called *modus tollens*. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement and the negation of the consequent, we can conclude the negation of the antecedent.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* Conditional statement: If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\n* Negation of the consequent: The clug did not snugged.\n\nTherefore, according to modus tollens, we can conclude:\n\n* Negation of the antecedent: The clug was not fleeked.\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
