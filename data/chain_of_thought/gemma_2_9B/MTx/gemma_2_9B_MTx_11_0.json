            "content": "\\\nI need a step-by-step explanation.\n\nExplanation: \nThis is a classic example of a logical argument that demonstrates the concept of Modus Tollens. Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that states:\n\n1. **If P, then Q.** (This is our first premise)\n2. **Not Q.** (This is our second premise)\n3. **Therefore, not P.** (This is the conclusion we want to reach)\n\nLet's break down the given statements and see how they fit into this form:\n\n* **Premise 1:** \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\"  Here, P is \"the flug was blummed\" and Q is \"the flug was zimmed.\"\n* **Premise 2:** \"The flug was not zimmed.\" This directly states \"not Q.\"\n\nSince we have both premises in the correct form, we can apply Modus Tollens.  \n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The flug was not blummed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
