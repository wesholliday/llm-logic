If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n\nThen we can conclude:\n\n3. Not P.\n\nLet's apply this to our example:\n\n* P: The shank was plooked.\n* Q: The shank was nugged.\n\n* Premise 1: If the shank was plooked (P), then the shank was nugged (Q).\n* Premise 2: The shank was not nugged (not Q).\n\nTherefore, according to Modus Tollens, we can conclude:\n\n* Conclusion: The shank was not plooked (not P).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
