It means that if the first part (antecedent) is true (the fribble was snurgled), then the second part (consequent) must also be true (the fribble crinked).\n\n* **Premise 2:** \"The fribble did not crink.\" This statement tells us the consequent of our conditional statement is false.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can conclude that the antecedent (the fribble was not snurgled) is also true.  \n\nWe can use a tool called a truth table to help us visualize this.  A truth table shows all possible combinations of truth values for the statements and helps us see what conclusions logically follow.\n\nHere's a simplified truth table for this scenario:\n\n| Snurgled? | Crinkled? | Conclusion |\n|---|---|---|\n| True | True |  |\n| True | False |  False |\n| False | True |  |\n| False | False |  |\n\nLooking at the table, we see that the only scenario where the consequent (\"The fribble crinked\") is false is when the antecedent (\"The fribble was snurgled\") is also false.\n\nTherefore, we can logically conclude that if the fribble did not crinkle, then it was not snurgled.\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
