It states that if a certain condition (the whiffle being shanked) is met, then a specific outcome (the whiffle tinking) will occur.\n\nThe question asks if we can reverse this relationship.  Reversing a conditional statement doesn't always lead to a logically equivalent statement.  \n\nTo determine if the reversed statement is logically equivalent, we need to consider the possibility of the antecedent (the \"if\" part) being true while the consequent (the \"then\" part) is false.\n\nIn this case, could a whiffle tinkle without being shanked?  It's possible.  \n\nTherefore, the reversed statement is not logically equivalent to the original.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
