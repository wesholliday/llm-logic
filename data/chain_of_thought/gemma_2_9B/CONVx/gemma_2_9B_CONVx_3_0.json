It states that if a certain condition (the splat being morphed) is true, then a specific consequence (the splat quanking) will also be true.\n\nTo determine if the reverse statement is also true, we need to consider the nature of the relationship.  \n\n* **Forward Inference:** If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked. This is the original statement.\n\n* **Reverse Inference:** If the splat quanked, then the splat was morphed. This is the statement we want to assess.\n\nIn general, the reverse inference is not necessarily true.  The original statement doesn't guarantee that the splat quanking *must* be caused by the splat being morphed. There could be other reasons why the splat might quank.\n\n**Example:**\n\nThink of it like this: \"If it rains, the ground is wet.\" This is a true statement. But, the reverse statement, \"If the ground is wet, then it rained,\" is not always true. The ground could be wet for other reasons (like someone spilled water).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBecause the original statement doesn't establish a one-to-one relationship, we cannot definitively infer that if the splat quanked, then the splat was morphed. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
