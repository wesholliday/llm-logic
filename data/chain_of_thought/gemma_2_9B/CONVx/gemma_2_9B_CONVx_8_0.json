The original statement is a conditional statement, meaning it asserts that if one thing is true (the sprocket was cranked), then another thing must also be true (the sprocket was daggled).  \n\nThe question asks if we can reverse this relationship and conclude that if the sprocket was daggled, then it must have been cranked. This is where the concept of logical equivalence comes in.\n\nNot all conditional statements are logically equivalent to their reversed counterparts.  The original statement doesn't guarantee that *every* time the sprocket is daggled, it was cranked. There could be other reasons why the sprocket might be daggled.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
