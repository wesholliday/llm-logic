In this case:\n\n* P: The wug was sproinged.\n* Q: The wug was garpled.\n\nThe question asks if we can reverse the conditional statement.  Reversing a conditional statement generally does *not* preserve its logical equivalence.  \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Counterexamples:**  Imagine a scenario where something can be garpled without being sproinged.  For example, maybe \"garpled\" means \"painted blue\" and \"sproinged\" means \"jumped\". A wug could be painted blue without ever having jumped. This would be a counterexample to the reversed statement.\n\n* **Logical Implication:** The original statement says that if something is sproinged, then it is *also* garpled. It doesn't say anything about whether something being garpled *implies* it was sproinged.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
