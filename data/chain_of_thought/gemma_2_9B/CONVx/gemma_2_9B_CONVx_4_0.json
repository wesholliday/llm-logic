This can be represented symbolically as P \u2192 Q (where P = \"the fribble was snurgled\" and Q = \"the fribble crinked\").\n\n* **Question:** Can we infer \"If the fribble crinked, then the fribble was snurgled\"? This can be represented as Q \u2192 P.\n\n* **Key Point:**  The original statement and the question statement are not logically equivalent.  The original statement tells us something happens *if* a certain condition is met (snurgling), but it doesn't guarantee that the crinkling *always* means the fribble was snurgled. There could be other reasons for the fribble to crinkle.\n\n**Example:** Imagine a scenario where a fribble crinkles when it's squeezed, regardless of whether it was snurgled or not.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
