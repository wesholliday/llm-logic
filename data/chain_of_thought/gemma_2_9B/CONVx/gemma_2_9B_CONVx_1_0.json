This can be represented symbolically as P \u2192 Q (where P = \"the flugel was blimmed\" and Q = \"the flugel was zargled\").\n\n* **Converse:** If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was blimmed. This is represented as Q \u2192 P.\n\n* **Inverse:** If the flugel was not blimmed, then the flugel was not zargled. This is represented as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ.\n\nThe original statement does **not** guarantee the truth of its converse.  \n\n**Counterexample:** Imagine a scenario where something can be zargled without being blimmed. For example, think of \"blimmed\" as a specific action and \"zargled\" as a broader state of being.  \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the converse from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
