It doesn't definitively say it's not there, just that it's a possibility.\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer\" is saying the notebook is *not* required to be in the drawer. It leaves open the possibility that it could be somewhere else.\n\nSince the original statement already allows for the possibility of the notebook not being in the drawer, the second statement is logically equivalent to the first.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
