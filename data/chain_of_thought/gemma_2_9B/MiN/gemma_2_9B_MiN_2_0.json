It doesn't definitively say it wasn't there, just that it's a possibility.\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\"  means the griffin's presence in the forest is not certain or required.\n\nSince the original statement allows for the possibility of the griffin *not* being in the forest, it logically follows that we can infer the griffin's presence is not a certainty.\n\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
