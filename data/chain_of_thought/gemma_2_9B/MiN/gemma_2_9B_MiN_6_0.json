It doesn't definitively say she didn't.  \n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" means that we can't say for sure that pizza was her choice. \n\nBoth statements express uncertainty about Sue's choice.  Therefore, we can infer that if one is true, the other is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
