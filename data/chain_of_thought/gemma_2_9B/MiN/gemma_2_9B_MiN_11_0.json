This means it could be somewhere else.  \n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the newspaper must be in the driveway\"  means the newspaper is *not* obligated to be in the driveway. It could be elsewhere.\n\nSince both statements convey the same meaning - that the newspaper is not definitely in the driveway - we can infer one from the other. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
