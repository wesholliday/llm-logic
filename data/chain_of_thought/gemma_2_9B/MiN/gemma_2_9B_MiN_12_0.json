This means there's a chance it could be somewhere else.  \n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair\"  means the jacket is not obligated or required to be on the chair. It could be elsewhere.\n\nBoth statements convey the same meaning: the jacket's location is uncertain and it's not definitively on the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
