This means it's not certain that the milk is on the counter.\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter\" means that there's no guarantee or obligation for the milk to be on the counter. It could be somewhere else.\n\nSince the original statement already implies that the milk might be somewhere else, the second statement is a logical consequence of the first.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
