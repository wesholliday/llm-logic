This means there's a chance they could be somewhere else.  \n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet\"  means the shoes are *not* definitely or necessarily in the closet. They could be elsewhere.\n\nSince both statements convey the same meaning - that the shoes' location is uncertain and not confined to the closet - we can infer one from the other. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
