This means there's a chance they could be somewhere else.  \n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag\"  means the sunglasses are not definitely or necessarily in her bag.  \n\nSince the original statement already implies that the sunglasses are not definitely in her bag, the second statement is a logical consequence of the first. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
