            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nLet's break down the original statement and the proposed inference:\n\n* **Original statement:** \"Mary might not have been at the wedding.\" This statement expresses uncertainty about Mary's presence at the wedding. It leaves open the possibility that she was there, but also the possibility that she wasn't.\n\n* **Proposed inference:** \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\" This statement asserts that it's not certain that Mary was at the wedding.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe original statement and the proposed inference are logically equivalent.  If Mary might not have been at the wedding, then it cannot be definitively stated that she must have been there.  The original statement already implies the lack of certainty required for the proposed inference.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
