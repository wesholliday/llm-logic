It means there's a chance she didn't buy it, but it doesn't definitively say she didn't.  \n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" is a stronger statement. It means we can't be certain she bought it.\n\nSince the original statement allows for the possibility that Lisa didn't buy the shirt, it logically follows that we can't say for sure she *must* have bought it. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
