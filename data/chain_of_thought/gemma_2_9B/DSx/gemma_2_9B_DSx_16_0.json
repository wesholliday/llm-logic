(This is a disjunction, meaning one or the other must be true)\n* **Premise 2:** The sneg is not sproted. (This negates one of the possibilities in the disjunction)\n\nSince we know the sneg is not sproted, the only remaining possibility from the first premise is that it must be crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
