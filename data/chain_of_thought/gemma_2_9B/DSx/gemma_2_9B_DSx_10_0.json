It says the wug must be either sproinged or garpled, but not both.\n    * Premise 2 negates the second part of the disjunction, stating that the wug is definitely not garpled.\n\n3. **Apply logic:**\n    * Since the wug cannot be garpled (Premise 2), the only remaining option from the disjunction in Premise 1 is that the wug must be sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
