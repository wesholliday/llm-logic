This means there's a possibility she wasn't there.\n* **Contrapositive:**  If Mary must have been at the wedding, then she definitely was at the wedding.\n\n* **Relationship:** The original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.  If one is true, the other must also be true.\n\n* **Conclusion:** Since the original statement allows for the possibility that Mary wasn't at the wedding, we can infer that it's not necessarily true that she *must* have been there. \n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
