The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order. \n\nLet's break down the original statement:\n\n* **Hypothesis:** The flugel was blimmed.\n* **Conclusion:** The flugel was zargled.\n\nNow, let's form the contrapositive:\n\n* **Negated Hypothesis:** The flugel was not blimmed.\n* **Negated Conclusion:** The flugel was not zargled.\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement is: \"If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\nSince the original statement is a conditional statement (if...then), its contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
