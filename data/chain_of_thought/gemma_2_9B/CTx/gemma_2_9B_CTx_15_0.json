The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order. \n\nLet's break down the original statement:\n\n* **Hypothesis:** The dreb was vroombed.\n* **Conclusion:** The dreb was spened.\n\nNow, let's form the contrapositive:\n\n* **Negated Hypothesis:** The dreb was not vroombed.\n* **Negated Conclusion:** The dreb was not spened.\n\n* **Reversed Order:** If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of the original statement is indeed \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\".  \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
