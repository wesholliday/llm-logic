The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order. \n\nLet's break down the original statement:\n\n* **Hypothesis:** The twonk was plinked.\n* **Conclusion:** It was varnished.\n\nNow, let's form the contrapositive:\n\n* **Negated Hypothesis:** The twonk was not plinked.\n* **Negated Conclusion:** It was not varnished.\n\n* **Reversed Order:** If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked.\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of the original statement is indeed \"If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
