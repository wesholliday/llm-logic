We need to determine if the original statement's logic can be reversed. \n\nThe original statement is a conditional statement:\n\n* **If P, then Q** (If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked)\n\nWe want to know if the following is also logically valid:\n\n* **If not Q, then not P** (If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked)\n\nThese are related through a concept called the **inverse** of a conditional statement.  The inverse of a conditional statement is not always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n* **Original statement:**  True if the whiffle was shanked AND it tinked.\n* **Inverse statement:** True if the whiffle did NOT tink AND it was NOT shanked.\n\nThe inverse is not always true.  Consider a simple example:\n\n* If it is raining, then the ground is wet. (True)\n* If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet. (False - the ground could be wet for other reasons)\n\n**Therefore, we need to carefully analyze the relationship between 'shanked' and 'tinked' in our specific example to see if their inverse holds true.**\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
