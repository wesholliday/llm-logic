            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nThis question asks about the logical relationship between two conditional statements.  The original statement is \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\" This is a standard \"if-then\" statement, also known as a conditional statement.  \n\nTo determine if the second statement is a valid inference, we need to consider the concept of logical equivalence. Two statements are logically equivalent if they always have the same truth value.  \n\nLet's analyze the original statement and its potential negation:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned. (Symbolically: P -> Q)\n* **Negation of the original statement:** The fleeg was bluttered, and it did not surn. (Symbolically: P and not Q)\n\nNow, let's look at the proposed inference:\n\n* **Proposed inference:** If the fleeg did not surn, then the fleeg was not bluttered. (Symbolically: not Q -> not P)\n\nWe can see that the proposed inference is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order.\n\nA key rule in logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, since the original statement \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" is given, we can infer that its contrapositive, \"If the fleeg did not surn, then the fleeg was not bluttered,\" is also true.\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes",
