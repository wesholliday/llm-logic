The contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\nLet's break down the original statement:\n\n* P: The smip was shripped\n* Q: The smip lupped the zoint\n\nThe original statement is \"If P, then Q\".\n\nThe contrapositive is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\nNow, we need to analyze if these two statements are logically equivalent.  They are logically equivalent because if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.  \n\nAnswer: \nyes \n\n\n",
