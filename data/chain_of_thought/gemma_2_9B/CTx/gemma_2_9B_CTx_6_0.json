In this case:\n\n* P: The grommet was sploffed.\n* Q: The grommet plopped the frink.\n\nThe original statement tells us that if the grommet was sploffed (P), then it must have plopped the frink (Q).\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer:\n\n* \"If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed\".\n\nThis statement is also a conditional statement, but with the order of P and Q reversed.  \n\nTo determine if we can infer this statement from the original, we need to think about the logical relationship between the two.\n\n**Here's how to approach it:**\n\n1. **Understanding Negation:**  The negation of \"P\" is \"not P\", and the negation of \"Q\" is \"not Q\".\n\n2. **Applying De Morgan's Law:** De Morgan's Law states that the negation of a conjunction (AND) is the disjunction (OR) of the negations, and vice versa.  \n\n3. **Rewriting the Statements:** Using these concepts, we can rewrite the original and target statements:\n\n   * Original: If P, then Q  (If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink)\n   * Target: If not Q, then not P (If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed)\n\n4. **Logical Equivalence:**  The original and target statements are logically equivalent. This means that if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\n**Therefore, we can infer the target statement from the original statement.**\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes",
