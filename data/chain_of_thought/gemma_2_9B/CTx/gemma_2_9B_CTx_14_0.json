The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then reversing their order. \n\n1. **Original statement:** If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\n2. **Negate both hypothesis and conclusion:** If the clug was NOT fleeked, then the clug did NOT snugged.\n3. **Reverse the order:** If the clug did NOT snugged, then the clug was NOT fleeked.\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of the original statement is indeed \"If the clug did not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked\".\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
