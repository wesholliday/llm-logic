The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order. \n\nLet's break down the original statement:\n\n* **Hypothesis:** The flob was skizzled.\n* **Conclusion:** The flob movated.\n\nNow, let's form the contrapositive:\n\n* **Negated Hypothesis:** The flob was not skizzled.\n* **Negated Conclusion:** The flob did not movated.\n\n* **Contrapositive:** If the flob did not movated, then the flob was not skizzled.\n\nTherefore, the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.  \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
