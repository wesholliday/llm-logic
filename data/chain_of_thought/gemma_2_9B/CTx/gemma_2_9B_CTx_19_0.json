The original statement is a conditional statement, meaning it has the form \"If P, then Q\".  \n\n* **Original statement:** If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.  \n    * P: The smonk was vreebled\n    * Q: The smonk plagged\n\n* **We want to check if the following is logically equivalent:** If the smonk did not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled.\n    *  \u00acQ: The smonk did not plagged\n    * \u00acP: The smonk was not vreebled\n\nTo see if these are logically equivalent, we can use the concept of contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing the order.\n\n* **Contrapositive of the original statement:** If the smonk was not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nNotice that the contrapositive is exactly the statement we want to check for equivalence.  Since the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can conclude:\n\nAnswer: yes \n\n\n",
