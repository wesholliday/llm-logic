The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order. \n\nLet's break down the original statement:\n\n* **Hypothesis:** The shank was plooked.\n* **Conclusion:** The shank was nugged.\n\nNow, let's form the contrapositive:\n\n* **Negated Hypothesis:** The shank was not plooked.\n* **Negated Conclusion:** The shank was not nugged.\n\n* **Reversed Order:** If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of the original statement is indeed 'If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked'.  \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
