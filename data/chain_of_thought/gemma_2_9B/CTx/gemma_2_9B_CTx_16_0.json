In this case:\n\n* P: The sneg was crampled.\n* Q: The sneg sproted the frink.\n\nThe original statement tells us that if the sneg was crampled (P), then it necessarily sproted the frink (Q).\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer:\n\n* \"If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nThis statement is also a conditional statement, but with the order of P and Q reversed.  \n\nTo determine if we can infer this new statement, we need to think about the relationship between the original statement and its converse. The converse of a conditional statement is formed by swapping the hypothesis (P) and the conclusion (Q).\n\nThe converse of the original statement would be:\n\n* \"If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was crampled.\"\n\nNotice that the original statement and its converse are not necessarily equivalent.  The original statement guarantees that if P is true, then Q is true. However, the converse only guarantees that if Q is true, then P is true. It's possible for Q to be true without P being true.\n\nIn our case, we can't be sure if the sneg sproted the frink without knowing if it was crampled.  Therefore, we cannot infer the new statement.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
