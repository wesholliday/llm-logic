The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then reversing their order. \n\nLet's break down the original statement:\n\n* **Hypothesis:** The flug was blummed.\n* **Conclusion:** The flug was zimmed.\n\nNow, let's form the contrapositive:\n\n* **Negated Hypothesis:** The flug was not blummed.\n* **Negated Conclusion:** The flug was not zimmed.\n\n* **Reversed Order:** If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed.\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of the original statement is indeed \"If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed\".\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
