This corresponds to the row where the original statement (p \u2192 q) is also false.\n\n   *  In all other cases, where p \u2192 q is true, \u00acq \u2192 \u00acp is also true.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n\n   *  Since \u00acq \u2192 \u00acp is true in all cases where p \u2192 q is true, we can infer that the original statement implies the statement we want to infer.\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes",
