This can be represented symbolically as:\n\n   P \u2192 Q\n\n   Where:\n    * P: The wug was flooped\n    * Q: The wug bimmed the zoint\n\n* **Conclusion:** We want to determine if the following is a valid inference:\n\n   \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\n   Where:\n    * \u00acQ: The wug did not bim the zoint\n    * \u00acP: The wug was not flooped\n\nTo determine if this is a valid inference, we can use the concept of logical equivalence.  A statement is logically equivalent to another if they always have the same truth value.  We need to see if the original premise (P \u2192 Q) logically implies the conclusion (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP).\n\nLet's consider the truth values of P and Q in different scenarios:\n\n* **Scenario 1: P is True, Q is True:** If the wug was flooped (P is true) and it bimmed the zoint (Q is true), then both the premise and the conclusion are true.\n\n* **Scenario 2: P is True, Q is False:** If the wug was flooped (P is true) but it did not bim the zoint (Q is false), then the premise is false (because the consequent, Q, is false).  The conclusion is also true (because \u00acQ is true and \u00acP is false).\n\n* **Scenario 3: P is False, Q is True:** If the wug was not flooped (P is false) and it bimmed the zoint (Q is true), then the premise is true (because the antecedent, P, is false, and a conditional statement is true when its antecedent is false). The conclusion is also true (because \u00acQ is false and \u00acP is true).\n\n* **Scenario 4: P is False, Q is False:** If the wug was not flooped (P is false) and it did not bim the zoint (Q is false), then both the premise and the conclusion are true.\n\nAnalyzing these scenarios, we see that the original premise (P \u2192 Q) does **not** logically imply the conclusion (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP).  \n\nAnswer: no \n",
