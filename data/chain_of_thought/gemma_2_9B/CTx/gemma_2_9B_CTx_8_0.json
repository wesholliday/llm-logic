This can be represented symbolically as P -> Q (where P = \"the sprocket was cranked\" and Q = \"the sprocket was daggled\").\n\n* **Contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order. The contrapositive of P -> Q is ~Q -> ~P (where ~ represents negation).\n\n* **Applying it to our problem:** The contrapositive of \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" is \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\n* **Logical Equivalence:**  A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they always have the same truth value. If one is true, the other must also be true. If one is false, the other must also be false.\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
