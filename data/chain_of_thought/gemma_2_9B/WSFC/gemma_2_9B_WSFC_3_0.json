These are presented as separate, mutually exclusive options.  The word \"or\" implies that only one of these options can be true.  \n\nThe new statement, \"The cat might be on the roof and it might be in the garden,\" suggests that both options could be true simultaneously. This contradicts the original statement's implication of exclusivity.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the cat might be on the roof and in the garden from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
