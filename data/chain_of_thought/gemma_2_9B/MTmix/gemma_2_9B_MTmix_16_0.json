It implies that if the sneg was crampled (the hypothesis), then sproting the frink (the conclusion) is a necessary outcome.\n\n2. **Analyze the second statement:** \"The sneg might not have sproted the frink.\" This statement weakens the connection between the sneg being crampled and sproting the frink. It introduces the possibility that the sneg could be crampled without sproting the frink.\n\n3. **Consider the inference:** We want to know if we can infer \"The sneg was not crampled\" from these statements.  Since the second statement allows for the possibility of the sneg being crampled without sproting the frink, the first statement's guarantee is weakened.  We can't definitively say the sneg was *not* crampled.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
