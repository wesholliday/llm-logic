It means that if the first part (the smonk was vreebled) is true, then the second part (the smonk must have plagged) is also true.\n\n* **\"The smonk might not have plagged\"**: This statement says that it's possible the smonk did not plagged. It doesn't definitively state that it didn't.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can conclude that \"The smonk was not vreebled\".  \n\nWe can use a technique called \"modus tollens\" to help us here. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states:\n\nIf we have:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Not Q\n\nThen we can conclude:\n\n3. Not P\n\nLet's apply this to our problem:\n\n1. If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged (P -> Q)\n2. The smonk might not have plagged (Not Q)\n\nSince we have the conditional statement and the negation of the consequent, we can apply modus tollens to conclude:\n\n3. The smonk was not vreebled (Not P)\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
