(This is a conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** The fribble might not have crinked. (This suggests the possibility that the fribble did not crinkle)\n\n* **What we want to find:** Can we conclude that the fribble was not snurgled?\n\nLet's analyze:\n\nThe first premise tells us that snurgling *always* leads to crinkling.  The second premise tells us that crinkling is not a certainty.  \n\nSince the fribble might not have crinkled, it means it's possible the fribble was not snurgled.  \n\nAnswer: \nyes \n\n\n",
