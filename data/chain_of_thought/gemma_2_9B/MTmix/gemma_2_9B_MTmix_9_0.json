It implies that plinking the twonk is a necessary condition for varnishing it.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The twonk might not have been varnished.\" This statement leaves open the possibility that the twonk was not varnished.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical relationship:\n\n*  We know plinking is a necessary condition for varnishing (from Statement 1).\n*  We also know varnishing is not guaranteed (from Statement 2).\n\nTherefore, it's possible that the twonk was not varnished because it was never plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
