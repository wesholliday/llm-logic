It implies that if the first part (the sprocket was cranked) is true, then the second part (the sprocket must have been daggled) is also true.\n\n2. **Analyze the second statement:** \"The sprocket might not have been daggled.\" This statement suggests that it's possible the sprocket was not daggled.\n\n3. **Consider the relationship:**  We're trying to determine if we can conclude that the sprocket was *not* cranked.  Notice that the second statement weakens the connection established by the first statement.  \n\n4. **Logical Inference:**  While the first statement suggests a strong link between cranking and daggling, the second statement introduces doubt about the daggling.  It doesn't directly address whether the sprocket *was* cranked, only that it *might not* have been daggled.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** We cannot definitively conclude that the sprocket was not cranked. The second statement doesn't provide enough information to overturn the possibility that the sprocket was cranked.\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
