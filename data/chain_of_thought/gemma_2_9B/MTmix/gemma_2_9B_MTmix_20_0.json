It implies that if the first part (the fleeg was bluttered) is true, then the second part (it must have been surned) is also true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It might not have been surned.\" This statement suggests that the possibility exists that the fleeg was *not* surned.\n\n**Analyzing the Logic**\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude that the fleeg was *not* bluttered.  Let's break down the logic:\n\n1. **Assume the opposite:**  To test our logic, let's assume the fleeg *was* bluttered.\n\n2. **Apply Statement 1:** If the fleeg was bluttered, then according to Statement 1, it *must* have been surned.\n\n3. **Conflict with Statement 2:** However, Statement 2 says it *might not* have been surned. This creates a contradiction.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since our assumption (the fleeg was bluttered) leads to a contradiction, it must be false. Therefore, the fleeg could not have been bluttered.\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
