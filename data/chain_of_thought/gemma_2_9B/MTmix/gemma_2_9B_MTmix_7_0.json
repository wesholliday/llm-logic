It means that if the first part (the whiffle was shanked) is true, then the second part (the whiffle must have tinked) is also true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The whiffle might not have tinked.\" This statement suggests that it's possible the whiffle did not tinkle.\n\n**Analyzing the Logic**\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude that the whiffle was *not* shanked.  Let's break down the logic:\n\n1. **Assume the opposite:**  To use logic effectively, let's assume the opposite of what we want to prove.  Assume the whiffle *was* shanked.\n\n2. **Apply Statement 1:** If the whiffle was shanked, then according to Statement 1, it *must* have tinked.\n\n3. **Conflict with Statement 2:**  But Statement 2 says the whiffle *might not* have tinked. This creates a contradiction.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since our assumption (the whiffle was shanked) leads to a contradiction, it must be false. Therefore, the whiffle was not shanked.\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
