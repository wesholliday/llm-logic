It can be represented symbolically as:\n\n   *  P \u2192 Q (where P = \"the smip was shripped\" and Q = \"the smip must have lupped the zoint\")\n\n* **Statement 2: \"The smip might not have lupped the zoint.\"** This statement is weaker. It means it's possible the smip didn't lupped the zoint. Symbolically:\n\n   * \u00acQ (where \u00ac means \"not\")\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"The smip was not shripped\" (\u00acP).  \n\nLet's think about the implications:\n\n* If the smip *was* shripped (P is true), then according to Statement 1, it *must* have lupped the zoint (Q is true).\n* Statement 2 tells us Q might not be true.\n\nSince these two statements seem to contradict each other, we can use a logical principle called *modus tollens* to reach our conclusion. Modus tollens states:\n\n* If P \u2192 Q is true, and \u00acQ is true, then \u00acP must also be true.\n\nApplying this to our example:\n\n* We have P \u2192 Q (Statement 1)\n* We have \u00acQ (Statement 2)\n\nTherefore, by modus tollens, we can conclude \u00acP, which means \"The smip was not shripped.\"\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
