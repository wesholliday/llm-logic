It means that if the first part (the splat was morphed) is true, then the second part (the splat must have quanked) is also true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The splat might not have quanked.\" This statement says that it's possible the splat did not quank.\n\n**Analyzing the Logic**\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude that \"The splat was not morphed\" based on the given statements.  Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Assume the opposite:**  To use logic effectively, let's assume the opposite of what we want to prove.  Assume \"The splat was morphed.\"\n\n2. **Apply Statement 1:** If the splat was morphed, then according to Statement 1, it must have quanked.\n\n3. **Conflict with Statement 2:** However, Statement 2 says the splat *might not* have quanked. This creates a contradiction.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since our assumption (\"The splat was morphed\") leads to a contradiction, it must be false. Therefore, the splat was not morphed.\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
