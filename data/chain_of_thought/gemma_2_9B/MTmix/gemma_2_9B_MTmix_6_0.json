We're dealing with conditional statements and negation.\n\n* **\"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink\"**  This is a classic \"if-then\" statement. It sets up a rule: if a certain condition (being sploffed) is true, then a consequence (plopping the frink) must also be true.\n\n* **\"The grommet might not have plopped the frink\"** This statement introduces doubt about the consequence. It says the plopping might not have happened.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can conclude that the grommet *wasn't* sploffed.  \n\nThink about it this way:\n\n* If the grommet *was* sploffed, then it *must* have plopped the frink according to the first statement.\n* But the second statement tells us the plopping *might not* have happened.\n\nThis creates a contradiction.  If the first statement is true, the second must be false.  Therefore, the only way to resolve this contradiction is if the first statement itself is false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
