It implies that if the first part (the glip was slogged) is true, then the second part (the glip must have tragged) is also true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The glip might not have tragged.\" This statement suggests that it's possible the glip did not tragged.\n\n**Analyzing the Logic**\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude that \"The glip was not slogged.\"  Let's break down the logic:\n\n1. **Assume the opposite:**  To use logic effectively, let's assume the opposite of what we want to prove.  Assume the glip *was* slogged.\n\n2. **Apply Statement 1:** If the glip was slogged (our assumption), then according to Statement 1, the glip must have tragged.\n\n3. **Conflict with Statement 2:** However, Statement 2 says the glip *might not* have tragged. This creates a conflict.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since our assumption (the glip was slogged) leads to a contradiction with Statement 2, our assumption must be false. Therefore, the glip was not slogged.\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
