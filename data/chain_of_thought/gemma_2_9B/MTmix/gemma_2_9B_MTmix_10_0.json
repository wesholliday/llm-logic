It implies that sproinging is a necessary condition for garpling.  \n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It might not have been garpled.\" This statement suggests that garpling is not a certainty.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship:\n\n* If the wug *was* sproinged, then according to Statement 1, it *must* have been garpled.\n* However, Statement 2 tells us that garpling is not guaranteed.\n\nThis means that the wug could have been sproinged and *not* garpled, which contradicts Statement 1.  Therefore, the only way to resolve this contradiction is to conclude that the wug was not sproinged in the first place.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
