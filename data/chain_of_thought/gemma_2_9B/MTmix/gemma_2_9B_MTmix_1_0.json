It tells us that if one thing (blimmed) is true, then another thing (zargled) must also be true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The flugel might not have been zargled.\" This statement says that it's possible the flugel was not zargled.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can conclude that the flugel was not blimmed.  \n\nThink about the structure of a conditional statement.  If the consequent (the part after \"then\") is not true, does that automatically mean the antecedent (the part before \"then\") is also not true?  No, not necessarily.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Example:** \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\"  It's possible the ground is not wet even if it's raining (maybe it's a very light rain, or the ground is covered).\n\nIn our case, we know the flugel *might* not have been zargled. This doesn't automatically mean it wasn't blimmed. It's possible the flugel was blimmed, and for some other reason, it wasn't zargled.\n\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
