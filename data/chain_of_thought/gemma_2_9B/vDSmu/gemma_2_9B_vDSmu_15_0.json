A disjunctive syllogism has the form:\n\n* P or Q\n* Not Q\n* Therefore, P\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The shoes are in the closet\n* Q: The shoes must be lined up by the door\n\nThe argument follows this structure perfectly. Since the second premise tells us that Q is false (the shoes are not lined up by the door), and the first premise establishes that either P or Q must be true, the only remaining possibility is that P is true (the shoes are in the closet).\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
