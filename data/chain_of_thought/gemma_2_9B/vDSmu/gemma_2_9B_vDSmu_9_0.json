The law of excluded middle states that for any proposition, either it is true or its negation is true.\n\nIn this case, the first premise presents a disjunction (an \"or\" statement): either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor. The second premise then negates the second part of the disjunction, stating that it's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\n\nSince the first premise establishes the two possibilities and the second premise eliminates one possibility, the conclusion logically follows. If the piece isn't blending in on the floor, the only remaining possibility is that it must be in the box.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
