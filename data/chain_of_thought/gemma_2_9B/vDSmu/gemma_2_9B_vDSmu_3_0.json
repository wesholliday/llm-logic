A disjunctive syllogism is a type of logical argument that uses the disjunction (or) to present two mutually exclusive alternatives.  \n\nHere's how it breaks down:\n\n* **Premise 1:**  \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\" This sets up the two possibilities.\n* **Premise 2:** \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\" This eliminates one of the possibilities.\n* **Conclusion:** \"The keys are in the drawer.\" This follows logically from the premises because if the second possibility is ruled out, the first possibility must be true.\n\nSince the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
