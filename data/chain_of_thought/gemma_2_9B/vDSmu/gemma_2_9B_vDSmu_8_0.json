The first premise presents a disjunction, meaning it offers two possible options: the remote is on the coffee table or it's under the couch. The second premise then negates one of those options (it's not under the couch).  \n\nSince we've eliminated one possibility, the remaining option must be true.  Therefore, the conclusion that the remote is on the coffee table logically follows from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
