A disjunctive syllogism has the following form:\n\n* Premise 1: P or Q\n* Premise 2: Not Q\n* Conclusion: Therefore, P\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The toy is in the toy box\n* Q: The toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\n\nThe argument follows this structure perfectly. Since the second premise tells us that Q (the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf) is false, the first premise (the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf) logically leads to the conclusion that P (the toy is in the toy box) must be true.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
