A disjunctive syllogism is a type of logical argument that uses a disjunction (an \"or\" statement) as one of its premises.  \n\nHere's how it breaks down:\n\n* **Premise 1:**  \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk\" sets up the disjunction. It presents two possible options.\n* **Premise 2:** \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk\"  negates one of the options in the disjunction.\n\nSince one option is ruled out, the remaining option must be true.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
