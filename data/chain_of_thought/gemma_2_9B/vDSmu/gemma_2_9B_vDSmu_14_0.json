A disjunctive syllogism has the form:\n\n* P or Q\n* Not Q\n* Therefore, P\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The milk is on the counter\n* Q: The milk must be chilling in the fridge\n\nThe argument follows this structure perfectly. Since the second premise tells us that Q is false (the milk doesn't have to be in the fridge), and the first premise establishes that either P or Q is true, the only remaining possibility is that P must be true (the milk is on the counter).\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
