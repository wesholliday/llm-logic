            "content": "\n\nExplanation: \nThis question tests our understanding of logical implication and its inverse. \n\n* **Original Statement:** \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This is a conditional statement. It asserts that if the first part (antecedent) is true, then the second part (consequent) must also be true.\n\n* **Inverse Statement:** \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\" This is the inverse of the original statement. It flips both the antecedent and the consequent.\n\n* **Logical Relationship:**  The original statement and its inverse are not always logically equivalent.  The original statement might be true, while its inverse is false.  \n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine Joe went to the park, but Lucy stayed home. The original statement is false in this case, but the inverse is also false.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWe cannot always infer the inverse from a conditional statement. \n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
