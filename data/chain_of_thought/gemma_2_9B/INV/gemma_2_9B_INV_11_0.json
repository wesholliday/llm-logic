            "content": "\n\nExplanation: \nThis question deals with logical reasoning and specifically the concept of contrapositive statements. \n\n* **Original Statement:** If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.  This can be represented symbolically as:  \n   * p \u2192 q (where p = \"the cake was chocolate\" and q = \"the muffins were blueberry\")\n\n* **Contrapositive Statement:** The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order. The contrapositive of our original statement is:\n   * \u00acq \u2192 \u00acp (where \u00ac represents negation)\n\n* **Relationship:**  A statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they always have the same truth value. If one is true, the other is also true. If one is false, the other is also false.\n\n* **Applying this to our problem:**  We are asked if we can infer \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry\" from the original statement. This is precisely the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nTherefore, since the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can indeed infer the second statement. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
