This can be represented symbolically as:  \n   *  P \u2192 Q (where P = \"the apple was red\" and Q = \"the banana was yellow\")\n\n* **Contrapositive Statement:** If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red. This can be represented as:\n   *  \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP (where \u00ac represents \"not\")\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means they always have the same truth value.  \n\nIf the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true. If the original statement is false, its contrapositive is also false.\n\nTherefore, we *can* infer 'If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
