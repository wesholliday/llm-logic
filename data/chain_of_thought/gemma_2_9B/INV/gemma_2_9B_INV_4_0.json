The original statement asserts that if P is true, then Q must also be true. The inverse, however, asserts that if P is false, then Q must also be false. These are different logical relationships.\n\n* **Counterexample:**  Consider a scenario where the alien never visited Mars (P is false) and the robot visited Jupiter anyway (Q is true). This scenario satisfies the original statement (since P is false, the implication doesn't hold), but it violates the inverse statement.\n\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
