            "content": "\n\nExplanation: \nThis question tests our understanding of logical implication and its inverse. \n\n* **Original Statement:** \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be represented symbolically as P -> Q, where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\n* **Inverse Statement:** \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\" This can be represented as ~P -> ~Q, where ~P means \"not Jeff played basketball\" and ~Q means \"not Amy played tennis.\"\n\n* **Relationship:** The original statement and its inverse are not logically equivalent.  The original statement only guarantees that if Jeff played basketball, Amy played tennis. It doesn't say anything about what happens if Jeff *didn't* play basketball.\n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine a scenario where Jeff didn't play basketball, but Amy played tennis anyway. This scenario would satisfy the original statement (since it doesn't say anything about Jeff not playing basketball) but would violate the inverse statement.\n\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
