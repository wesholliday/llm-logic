The original statement is a conditional statement, meaning it proposes a relationship between two events:\n\n* **Hypothesis:** Sue chose pizza.\n* **Conclusion:** Bob chose pasta.\n\nThe statement asserts that if the hypothesis (Sue choosing pizza) is true, then the conclusion (Bob choosing pasta) must also be true.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer:\n\n* **Hypothesis:** Sue did not choose pizza.\n* **Conclusion:** Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nThis statement is the *contrapositive* of the original statement.  The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order.\n\nA key principle in logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\nTherefore, since the original statement is given, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
