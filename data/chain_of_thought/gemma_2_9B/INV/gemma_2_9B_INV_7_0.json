This can be represented symbolically as P -> Q (where P = Alex finished the race, and Q = Chris finished the race).\n\n* **Contrapositive Statement:** The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order.  The contrapositive of our original statement is: If Chris didn't finish the race, then Alex didn't finish the race. This can be represented as ~Q -> ~P.\n\n* **Relationship:**  The original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\n* **The Question:** The question asks if we can infer \"If Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race\". This is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
