This can be represented symbolically as P -> Q (where P = shirt is cotton, Q = pants are denim).\n\n* **Contrapositive Statement:** If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton. This is represented as ~Q -> ~P.\n\nThe key is to understand that the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they always have the same truth value.  \n\nIf the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true. If the original statement is false, its contrapositive is also false.\n\n**Therefore, we can infer that if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.**\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
