The original statement is a conditional statement, meaning it proposes a relationship between two events: if one event happens (the doll being plastic), then another event must also happen (the truck being metal).  \n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order.  \n\nLet's break it down:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n* **Contrapositive:** If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\n\nNotice how the contrapositive mirrors the original statement but with the negations and reversed order.  \n\nIn logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they always have the same truth value. If one is true, the other must also be true. If one is false, the other must also be false.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
