The original statement is a conditional statement, meaning it proposes a relationship between two events:\n\n* **Hypothesis:** The dog was inside.\n* **Conclusion:** The cat was outside.\n\nThis statement asserts that if the hypothesis (dog inside) is true, then the conclusion (cat outside) must also be true.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer:\n\n* **Hypothesis:** The dog was not inside.\n* **Conclusion:** The cat was not outside.\n\nThis statement proposes the opposite relationship. It asserts that if the hypothesis (dog not inside) is true, then the conclusion (cat not outside) must also be true.\n\nTo determine if we can infer this new statement, we need to examine the logical connection between the original statement and the new one.  Notice that the original statement doesn't directly address the scenario where the dog is *not* inside. It only tells us what happens when the dog *is* inside.  \n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively conclude that if the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside. The original statement doesn't provide enough information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
