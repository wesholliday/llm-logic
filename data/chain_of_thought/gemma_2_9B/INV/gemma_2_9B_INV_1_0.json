            "content": "\n\nExplanation: \nThis is a classic example of a logical fallacy called \"denying the antecedent.\"  \n\nThe original statement is a conditional statement, meaning it asserts that one event (Mary being at the wedding) implies another event (Sue being at the wedding).  \n\nDenying the antecedent means assuming that if the first part of the conditional statement is false, the second part must also be false.  \n\nHowever, this isn't always true.  \n\nLet's break it down:\n\n* **Original statement:** If P, then Q (If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding)\n* **Fallacious statement:** If not P, then not Q (If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding)\n\nThe fallacy arises because there could be other reasons why Sue might not be at the wedding even if Mary wasn't there.  \n\nFor example, maybe Sue had a prior commitment, or maybe she simply didn't want to attend.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
