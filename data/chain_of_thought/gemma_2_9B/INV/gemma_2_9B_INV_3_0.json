            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nLet's break down the original statement and see how it relates to the question.\n\nThe original statement is a conditional statement. It says that *if* a certain condition is met (the book was written by James), *then* a certain outcome occurs (the book is a mystery novel).  \n\nThe question asks if we can infer a *contrapositive* of this statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by switching the hypothesis and conclusion and negating both.\n\n* **Original statement:** If P, then Q.\n* **Contrapositive:** If not Q, then not P.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The book was written by James.\n* Q: The book is a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of the original statement is:\n\n* **If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.**\n\nThis is logically equivalent to the statement in the question. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
