            "content": "\n\nExplanation: \nThis question tests our understanding of logical implication and its inverse. \n\n* **Original Statement:** \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented symbolically as P -> Q, where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n* **Inverse Statement:** \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as ~P -> ~Q, where ~P means \"not P\" and ~Q means \"not Q.\"\n\n* **Relationship:** The original statement and its inverse are not logically equivalent.  The original statement says that if P is true, then Q must also be true. The inverse says that if P is false, then Q must also be false.  These are not always the same.\n\n**Counterexample:**\n\nImagine a scenario where Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, but Mark bought the blue shirt anyway. This would satisfy the original statement (since Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, the \"if\" part is not relevant), but it would violate the inverse statement.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
