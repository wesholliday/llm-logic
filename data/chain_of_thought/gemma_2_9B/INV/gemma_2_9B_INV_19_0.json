            "content": "\n\nExplanation: \nThis question tests our understanding of logical implication and its inverse. \n\n* **Original statement:** \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This can be represented symbolically as P -> Q, where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\n* **Inverse statement:** \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\" This can be represented as ~P -> ~Q, where ~P means \"not P\" and ~Q means \"not Q.\"\n\n* **Relationship:** The original statement and its inverse are not logically equivalent.  The original statement says that if P is true, then Q must also be true. The inverse statement says that if P is false, then Q must also be false.  These are not always the case.\n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine a scenario where Tom didn't watch football, but Jen still watched basketball for some other reason. This would make the original statement true (because the \"if\" part is false), but the inverse statement false.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
