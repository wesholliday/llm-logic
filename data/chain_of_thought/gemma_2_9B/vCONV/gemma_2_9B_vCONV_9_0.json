Just because Mark bought the blue shirt doesn't necessarily mean Lisa bought the red shirt. There could be other scenarios where Mark bought the blue shirt without Lisa buying the red shirt.\n\nFor example:\n\n* Mark could have bought the blue shirt independently of Lisa's actions.\n* The original premise might be based on a specific situation, and there are other situations where the relationship doesn't hold.\n\n**Answer:** no \n",
