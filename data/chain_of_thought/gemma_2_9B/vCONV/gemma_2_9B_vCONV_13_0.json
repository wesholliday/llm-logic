This doesn't necessarily mean that if the truck is blue, then the car must be red.  \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Example:** Imagine a scenario where the car is green and the truck is blue. This scenario satisfies the original premise (if the car was red, the truck would be blue), but it doesn't support the conclusion (if the truck is blue, the car must be red).\n\n* **Logical Structure:** The original premise has the form \"If P, then Q,\" while the conclusion has the form \"If Q, then P.\" These are not logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
