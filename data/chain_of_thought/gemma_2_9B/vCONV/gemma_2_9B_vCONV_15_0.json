A conditional statement has the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is the hypothesis and Q is the conclusion.  \n\nIn this case, the premise is \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This can be written symbolically as P -> Q, where P is \"Sam took a plane\" and Q is \"Erin took a train.\"\n\nThe conclusion is \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane.\" This can be written symbolically as Q -> P.\n\nNotice that the premise and conclusion have swapped the hypothesis and conclusion of the original conditional statement.  \n\nA key concept in logic is that the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true.  The converse of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If Q, then P.\"  Just because P implies Q doesn't mean that Q implies P.\n\nFor example, consider the statement \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" This is true. However, the converse, \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining,\" is not necessarily true. The ground could be wet for other reasons, such as someone watering the lawn.\n\nIn the same way, the argument's conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.  Just because Sam taking a plane implies Erin taking a train, it doesn't mean that Erin taking a train implies Sam taking a plane.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
