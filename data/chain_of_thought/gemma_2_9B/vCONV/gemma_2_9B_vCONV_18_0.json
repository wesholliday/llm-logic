A biconditional statement is a statement that asserts that two propositions are logically equivalent.  In this case, the argument is trying to establish that the propositions \"the doll was plastic\" and \"the truck was metal\" are logically equivalent.\n\nHowever, the argument's structure doesn't directly demonstrate this equivalence. The premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. This is a conditional statement, implying a directionality. It doesn't necessarily mean that if the truck was metal, the doll had to be plastic.\n\nFor example, it's possible that the truck could be metal for reasons unrelated to the doll's material.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because it doesn't provide sufficient evidence to establish the logical equivalence of the two propositions.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
