It claims that if the unicorn is in the forest, then the griffin must also be there. This is not necessarily true.  \n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine the unicorn is in the forest, but the griffin is not. This scenario satisfies the premise (unicorn in the forest) but violates the conclusion (griffin not in the forest).\n\nSince the conclusion doesn't logically follow from the premise, the argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
