This is a conditional statement.  \n\nThe conclusion, however, flips the conditional relationship. It states that if the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien visited Mars. This is not necessarily true.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine the alien never visited Mars, but the robot still visited Jupiter for some other reason. This would satisfy the original premise but not the conclusion.\n\nBecause the conclusion doesn't logically follow from the premise, the argument is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
