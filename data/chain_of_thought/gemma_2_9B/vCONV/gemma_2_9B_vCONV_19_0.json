A conditional statement has the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is the hypothesis and Q is the conclusion.  \n\nIn this case, the premise is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This can be written symbolically as P -> Q, where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nThe conclusion is \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football.\" This can be written symbolically as Q -> P.\n\nNotice that the premise and conclusion have swapped the hypothesis and conclusion of the original conditional statement.  \n\nA key concept in logic is that the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true.  The converse of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If Q, then P.\"  Just because P implies Q doesn't mean that Q implies P.\n\nFor example, if it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q). This is true. But the converse, \"If the ground is wet (Q), then it's raining (P)\" is not necessarily true. The ground could be wet for other reasons besides rain.\n\nIn our case, the argument's conclusion is the converse of the premise. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid because the converse of a conditional statement is not always true. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
