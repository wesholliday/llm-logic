Just because the wolf might be in the den *if* the bear is in the case, doesn't mean the bear *must* be in the case *if* the wolf is in the den.\n\nThink of it this way:\n\n* The premise might be true:  Maybe there's a rule that whenever a bear is in a case, a wolf is always in a den.\n* But, the conclusion doesn't follow: There could be other reasons why a wolf might be in a den, unrelated to a bear being in a case.\n\n**Answer:** no \n",
