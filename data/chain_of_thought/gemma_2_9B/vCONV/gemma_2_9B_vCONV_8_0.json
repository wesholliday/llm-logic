The conclusion flips this around: \"If Q, then P\" (If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake).\n\n* **The Flaw:**  Just because the mummy being awake *might* be a consequence of the vampire being awake doesn't mean the reverse is necessarily true.  There could be other reasons why the mummy might be awake.\n\n* **Example:** Imagine a scenario where a magical spell awakens both the vampire and the mummy. The premise holds true (if the vampire is awake, the mummy is awake). But, the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow. The mummy could be awake for reasons unrelated to the vampire.\n\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
