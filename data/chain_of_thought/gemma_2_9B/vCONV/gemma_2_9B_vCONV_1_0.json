However, the conclusion reverses this relationship, assuming that Sue's presence guarantees Mary's presence. This is not necessarily true. \n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine Sue is a very social person who attends many weddings. It's possible for Sue to be at a wedding without Mary being there.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
