The conclusion attempts to flip this relationship, stating that if B (banana is yellow), then A (apple is red).  \n\nHowever, the original premise doesn't guarantee that if the banana is yellow, the apple *must* be red. There could be other reasons why the banana is yellow, and the apple could be a different color.\n\nFor example, the apple could be green, and the banana could be yellow for reasons unrelated to the apple's color.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
