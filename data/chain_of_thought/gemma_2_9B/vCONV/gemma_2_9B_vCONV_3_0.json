The second premise essentially reverses this relationship.\n\n* **The Flaw:**  Affirming the consequent occurs when we assume that because the consequent (the book being a mystery novel) is true, the antecedent (the book being written by James) must also be true. This is a flawed line of reasoning.\n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine a scenario where someone else wrote a mystery novel.  The consequent (mystery novel) is true, but the antecedent (written by James) is false. This demonstrates that the argument's structure is not logically sound.\n\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
