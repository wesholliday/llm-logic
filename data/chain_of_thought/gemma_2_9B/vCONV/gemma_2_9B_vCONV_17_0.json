This is a conditional statement.  \n\nThe conclusion, however, flips the conditional statement, stating that if Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta. This is not necessarily true. \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine a scenario where Kate ate salad, but Ben didn't eat pasta. This would violate the conclusion's claim.\n\nSince the conclusion doesn't logically follow from the premise, the argument is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
