This doesn't mean that if Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball.  \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Example:** Imagine a scenario where Jeff loves to play basketball, but Amy only plays tennis when her friend invites her.  If Jeff doesn't play basketball, Amy might not play tennis at all.\n\nThe argument confuses the direction of the conditional statement.  \n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
