(This is a conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** The book was written by James. (This is a factual statement)\n\nSince the first premise establishes a conditional relationship, and the second premise confirms the condition (that the book was written by James), we can logically conclude that the consequence of that condition must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
