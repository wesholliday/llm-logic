(This is a conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** The shirt was cotton. (This is a factual statement)\n\nSince we know the shirt was cotton (Premise 2), and the first premise tells us that *if* the shirt was cotton, *then* the pants were denim, we can logically conclude that the pants must have been denim.  \n\n**Answer:** yes \n",
