(This is a conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** The alien visited Mars. (This is a factual statement)\n\nSince the first premise establishes a conditional relationship, the second premise (the alien visiting Mars) triggers the consequent part of the conditional statement.  Therefore, we can logically conclude that the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
