It doesn't say the jacket definitely isn't in the closet, just that it's possible.\n\nSince the first statement presents two possibilities, and the second statement casts doubt on one possibility, the only remaining logical conclusion is that the jacket must be draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes \n\n\n",
