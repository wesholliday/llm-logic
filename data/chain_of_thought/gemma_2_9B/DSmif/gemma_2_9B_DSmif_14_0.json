The milk can be in one place or the other, not both.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\" This statement weakens the certainty of the first statement. It introduces the possibility that the milk is *not* in the fridge, but it doesn't definitively say where it is.\n\nSince the first statement says the milk *must* be in one of two places, and the second statement says it *might not* be in the fridge, the only remaining possibility is that it must be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
