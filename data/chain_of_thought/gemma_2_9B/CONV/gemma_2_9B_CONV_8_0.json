            "content": "\n\nExplanation: \nThis question deals with logical reasoning, specifically the concept of conditional statements and their reversals. \n\n* **Original Statement:** \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This can be represented symbolically as V \u2192 M (where V stands for \"vampire was awake\" and M stands for \"mummy was awake\").\n\n* **Reversed Statement:** \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake.\" This can be represented as M \u2192 V.\n\n* **Logical Relationship:**  The original statement does *not* guarantee the truth of the reversed statement.  \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine a scenario where the mummy is awake, but the vampire is asleep. This scenario satisfies the original statement (since it doesn't say anything about the vampire being awake) but violates the reversed statement.\n\n* **Converse vs. Inverse:** The reversed statement is the *converse* of the original statement.  The converse of a conditional statement is not always logically equivalent to the original.\n\n\nAnswer: \nno",
