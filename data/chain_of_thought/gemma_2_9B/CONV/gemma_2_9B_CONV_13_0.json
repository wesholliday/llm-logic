It says that the color of the car (being red) is a *sufficient* condition for the truck to be blue.\n\n* **Reverse Statement:** \"If the truck was blue, then the car was red.\" This statement reverses the relationship. Now it suggests that the color of the truck (being blue) is a *sufficient* condition for the car to be red.\n\nThe key here is to understand that the original statement doesn't guarantee that *every* blue truck had a red car associated with it. It only states that *if* the car was red, *then* the truck was blue.  There could be blue trucks with cars of other colors.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer the reverse statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
