It says that the purchase of the red shirt by Lisa is a *sufficient* condition for Mark to buy the blue shirt.\n\n* **Reverse Statement:** \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\" This statement reverses the cause-and-effect relationship.\n\n* **Logical Equivalence:**  The original statement and the reverse statement are *not* logically equivalent.  The original statement doesn't guarantee that Lisa bought the red shirt *only* if Mark bought the blue shirt. There could be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\n**Answer:** no \n",
