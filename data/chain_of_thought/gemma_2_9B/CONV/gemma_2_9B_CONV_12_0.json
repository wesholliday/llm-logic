This is a conditional statement, meaning it proposes a cause-and-effect relationship.\n\n* **Inverse Statement:** If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park. This is the inverse of the original statement. It flips both the hypothesis (If Joe went to the park) and the conclusion (then Lucy went to the zoo).\n\n* **Logical Relationship:**  In general, the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true.  The original statement only tells us that *if* Joe went to the park, *then* Lucy went to the zoo. It doesn't say anything about what happens if Lucy went to the zoo.  \n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine Joe and Lucy have different schedules. Joe might go to the park on Tuesdays, and Lucy might go to the zoo on Wednesdays. The original statement would be true in this case, but the inverse would be false.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
