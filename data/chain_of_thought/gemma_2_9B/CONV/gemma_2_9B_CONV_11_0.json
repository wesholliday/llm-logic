This can be represented symbolically as P -> Q (where P = \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q = \"the muffins were blueberry\").\n\n* **Converse:** If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate. This is represented as Q -> P.\n\n* **Inverse:** If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry. This is represented as ~P -> ~Q.\n\nThe original statement does *not* guarantee the truth of its converse.  Here's why:\n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine a scenario where the cake was vanilla and the muffins were blueberry. This satisfies the original statement (the cake wasn't chocolate, so the implication holds), but it violates the converse (the muffins were blueberry, but the cake wasn't chocolate).\n\n**Answer:** \nno \n\n\n",
