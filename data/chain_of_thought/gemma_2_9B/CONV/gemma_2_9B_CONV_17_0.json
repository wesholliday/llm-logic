The original statement, \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad,\" can be represented symbolically as:\n\n* P \u2192 Q (where P = Ben ate pasta, Q = Kate ate salad)\n\nThe question asks if we can infer the reverse statement, \"If Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta,\" which can be represented as:\n\n* Q \u2192 P\n\nThese two statements are not logically equivalent.  The original statement tells us something about the relationship between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating salad, but it doesn't guarantee that if Kate ate salad, Ben *must* have eaten pasta.  \n\nFor example, Kate could have eaten salad for other reasons, such as having it as a side dish with a different main course.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
