            "content": "\n\nExplanation: \nThis question deals with logical reasoning and specifically the concept of conditional statements. \n\n* **Original Statement:** \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This statement sets up a cause-and-effect relationship. It says that if a certain condition (Jeff playing basketball) is met, then a specific outcome (Amy playing tennis) will follow.\n\n* **Reverse Logic:** The question asks if we can reverse this relationship.  The reversed statement is: \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball.\"\n\n* **Contrapositive:**  The key here is to understand that the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order.\n\n* **Applying the Contrapositive:**\n\n    * Original: If P, then Q\n    * Contrapositive: If not Q, then not P\n\n    In our case:\n\n    * Original: If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n    * Contrapositive: If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\n\n* **Conclusion:**  The original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. However, the original statement does *not* logically imply the reversed statement.  The reversed statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true.\n\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
