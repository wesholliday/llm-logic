The antecedent (the \"if\" part) is \"the bear was in the case,\" and the consequent (the \"then\" part) is \"the wolf was in the den.\"\n\n* **Converse Statement:** The converse of a conditional statement is formed by swapping the antecedent and consequent. In this case, the converse would be: \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case.\"\n\n* **Logical Relationship:**  The original statement and its converse are not always logically equivalent.  Just because one statement is true doesn't necessarily mean the other is also true.  \n\n**Example:**\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n* If it's raining (antecedent), then the ground is wet (consequent). This is generally true.\n* But, just because the ground is wet (antecedent), doesn't necessarily mean it's raining (consequent). The ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled water, etc.).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn our original example, we cannot definitively say that if the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case. The original statement only tells us that if the bear *was* in the case, then the wolf *was* in the den. It doesn't guarantee the reverse.\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
