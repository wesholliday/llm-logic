The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\n* **Truth Value:**  The original statement and its contrapositive always have the same truth value. This means if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\n* **Our Case:**  The original statement doesn't guarantee that if Chris finished the race, Alex also finished.  It only says that if Alex finished, Chris did too.  \n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
