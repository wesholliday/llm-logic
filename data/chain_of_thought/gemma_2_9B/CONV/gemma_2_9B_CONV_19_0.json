            "content": "\n\nExplanation: \nThis question deals with logical reasoning and specifically the concept of conditional statements. \n\n* **Original Statement:** \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This statement sets up a cause-and-effect relationship. It says that if a certain condition (Tom watching football) is met, then a specific outcome (Jen watching basketball) will follow.\n\n* **Reverse Logic:** The question asks if we can reverse this relationship.  The reversed statement is: \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football.\"\n\n* **Contrapositive:**  The key here is to understand that the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order.\n\n* **Applying the Contrapositive:**\n\n    * Original: If P, then Q\n    * Contrapositive: If not Q, then not P\n\n    In our case:\n\n    * P: Tom watched football\n    * Q: Jen watched basketball\n\n    * Original: If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n    * Contrapositive: If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\n\n* **Conclusion:**  The original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. However, the question asks about the direct reversal, not the contrapositive.  The direct reversal is not necessarily true.  Just because Jen watched basketball doesn't automatically mean Tom watched football. There could be other reasons why Jen watched basketball.\n\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
