It means that if the first part (the doll being plastic) is true, then the second part (the truck being metal) must also be true.\n\n* **Converse Statement:** \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic.\" This statement reverses the order of the original statement.\n\n* **Logical Implication:**  The original statement does *not* guarantee that the converse statement is also true.  Just because one thing implies another doesn't mean the reverse is automatically true.\n\n**Example:**\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n* If it's raining (doll is plastic), then the ground is wet (truck is metal). This is true.\n* But, just because the ground is wet (truck is metal) doesn't mean it's raining (doll is plastic). The ground could be wet for other reasons.\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
