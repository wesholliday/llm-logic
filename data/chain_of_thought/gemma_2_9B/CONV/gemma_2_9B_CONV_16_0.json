It doesn't say anything about what happens if the pants are denim.\n\n* **Converse Statement:** \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton.\" This statement claims that if the pants have the property of being denim, then the shirt *necessarily* has the property of being cotton.\n\n**Key Point:** The original statement and its converse are not logically equivalent.  The truth of the original statement does not guarantee the truth of the converse.  \n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine a scenario where the shirt is made of silk and the pants are denim. The original statement is still true (because it only talks about what happens *if* the shirt were cotton). However, the converse is false in this scenario.\n\nAnswer: \nno",
