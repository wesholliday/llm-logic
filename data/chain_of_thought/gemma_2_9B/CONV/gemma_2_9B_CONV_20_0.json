It doesn't say anything about what happens when the banana is yellow.\n\n* **Converse Statement:** \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\" This statement claims that whenever a banana is yellow, an apple is always red.  \n\nThe original statement doesn't provide enough information to guarantee the truth of the converse.  \n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine a scenario where the apple is green and the banana is yellow. The original statement is still true because it only focuses on the case where the apple is red. However, the converse statement would be false in this scenario.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
