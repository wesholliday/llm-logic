This scenario satisfies the original statement (P -> Q) because if the dog was inside (which it isn't), then the cat would have to be outside. However, it does not satisfy the inverse statement (Q -> P) because if the cat was outside (which it is), the dog doesn't have to be inside.\n\n**Answer:** no \n",
