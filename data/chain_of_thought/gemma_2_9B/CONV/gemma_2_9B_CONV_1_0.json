            "content": "\n\nExplanation: \nThis question deals with logical reasoning and specifically the concept of conditional statements. \n\n* **Original Statement:** \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This statement asserts that if the first part (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue being at the wedding) is also true. It doesn't say anything about what happens if Sue is at the wedding.\n\n* **Reverse Statement:** \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\" This statement is the reverse of the original. It asserts that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary must also have been there.\n\n* **Logical Equivalence:**  These two statements are not logically equivalent. The original statement only guarantees that if Mary is present, Sue is present. It doesn't guarantee the opposite.  \n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine a scenario where Mary wasn't invited to the wedding, but Sue was.  The original statement wouldn't be false, but the reverse statement would be.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
