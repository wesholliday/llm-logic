This is a conditional statement.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** The bear was not in the cave. This is a negation of the first premise's antecedent (the \"if\" part).\n\n3. **Conclusion:** Can we infer that the wolf was not in the den?  We need to see if the premises lead us to this conclusion.\n\nSince the first premise states that the wolf is in the den *only if* the bear is in the cave, and we know the bear is *not* in the cave, we can conclude that the wolf is not in the den either.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
