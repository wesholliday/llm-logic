It tells us that being written by James is a sufficient condition for the book to be a mystery novel.\n\n2. **The book was not written by James.** This statement contradicts the first statement's antecedent (the \"if\" part).\n\nSince the antecedent of the conditional statement is false, we can't directly apply the consequent (the \"then\" part).  The truth of the consequent (the book being a mystery novel) is not guaranteed.\n\nAnswer: \n",
