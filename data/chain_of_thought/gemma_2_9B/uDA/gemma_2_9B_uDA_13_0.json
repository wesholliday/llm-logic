This is a conditional statement.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** The car was not red. This contradicts the \"if\" part of the conditional statement.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**  Since the car wasn't red, the first premise doesn't apply.  We can't directly conclude anything about the color of the truck. The conditional statement only tells us what would happen *if* the car were red.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
