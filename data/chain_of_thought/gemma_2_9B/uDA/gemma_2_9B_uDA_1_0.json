It means that Mary being at the wedding is a necessary condition for Sue being at the wedding.\n* **Premise 2:** Mary was not at the wedding. This is a statement of fact.\n\n* **Conclusion:** We want to know if we can infer that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nSince we know Mary was *not* at the wedding, and the first premise states that Sue *only* attends if Mary does, we can conclude that Sue was also not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
