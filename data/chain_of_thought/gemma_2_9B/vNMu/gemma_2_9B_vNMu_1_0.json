This doesn't necessarily mean she wasn't there, just that there's no obligation or necessity for her presence.\n\nThe conclusion states that Mary *might* not have been at the wedding. This is a weaker statement than the premise.\n\nSince the premise doesn't directly support the conclusion, the argument is not logically valid.  \n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
