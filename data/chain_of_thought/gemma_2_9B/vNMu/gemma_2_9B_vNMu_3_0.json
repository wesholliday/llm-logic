This doesn't directly imply that Q is true.  It's possible that the book was written by someone else, but it's also possible that there's some other explanation for why the book wasn't written by James (e.g., it was written collaboratively, or it's a forgery).\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the premise doesn't guarantee the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
