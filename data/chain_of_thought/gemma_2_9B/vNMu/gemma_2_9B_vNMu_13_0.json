It could be elsewhere.\n\n* **Conclusion:** \"The toy might not be in the toy box.\" This statement simply suggests the possibility that the toy is not in the toy box.\n\nThe premise directly supports the conclusion. If the toy isn't required to be in the toy box, then it's certainly possible for it to be somewhere else.  \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
