This doesn't directly negate the possibility of it being in the driveway, just that it's not a strict requirement.\n\n* The conclusion \"The newspaper might not be in the driveway\" follows logically from this. If it's not a requirement for the newspaper to be in the driveway, then it's possible (or might) be somewhere else.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
