This doesn't definitively say they are *somewhere else*, just that the closet isn't the only possibility.\n\nThe conclusion, however, weakens the premise by saying the shoes \"might not\" be in the closet. This is a weaker statement than the premise.\n\nSince the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premise, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
