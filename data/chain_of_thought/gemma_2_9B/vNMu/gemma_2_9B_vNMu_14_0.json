It could be somewhere else.\n\n* **Conclusion:** \"The milk might not be on the counter.\" This means there's a possibility the milk is not on the counter.\n\nThe premise essentially states that the milk has other possible locations besides the counter. The conclusion then logically follows from this premise. If the milk isn't required to be on the counter, then it's possible it's not there.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
