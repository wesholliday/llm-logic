An argument can be valid but have a false premise, making the conclusion unsound.\n\n* In this case, the premise \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag\" doesn't necessarily mean the sunglasses aren't in her bag at all. They could be there, but it's not a certainty.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
