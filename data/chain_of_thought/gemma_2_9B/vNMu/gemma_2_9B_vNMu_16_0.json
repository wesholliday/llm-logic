This doesn't definitively say it's *not* in the bag, just that it's not a requirement for some other situation or truth.\n\nThe conclusion, however, states that the pen *might* not be in the bag. This is a weaker statement than the premise.  \n\nSince the conclusion is a weaker version of the premise, it logically follows from the premise.  \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
