It leaves open the possibility that the vampire was asleep or in some other state.\n\n* **Conclusion:** \"The vampire might not have been awake.\" This conclusion directly follows from the premise. If we can't say for sure the vampire was awake, then it's certainly possible they weren't.\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premise, the argument is valid.  \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
