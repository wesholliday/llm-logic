The premise only tells us that it's *not necessary* for the alien to have visited Mars, not that it definitely *didn't* happen.\n\n* **Therefore:** While the argument has a similar structure to modus tollens, it's not a perfect example because the conclusion is not as strong as what a strict modus tollens would guarantee. \n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
