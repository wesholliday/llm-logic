This sentence suggests that there is a possibility that both the frazzle is flimble and the quazzle is flonk by grazzle.  \n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"It might be that the frazzle is flimble and the quazzle is flonk by grazzle\". This sentence is structurally identical to the original sentence. \n\nTherefore, since the original sentence states a possibility, and the question sentence is structurally identical, we can infer that the question sentence is also a possibility. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
