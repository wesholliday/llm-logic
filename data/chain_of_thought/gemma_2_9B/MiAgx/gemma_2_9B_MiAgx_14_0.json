This sentence presents two separate possibilities:\n\n1. The blurble might be blurble for a flump.\n2. The wumble might be snizzle.\n\nThe second sentence asks if we can infer \"It might be that the blurble is blurble for a flump and the wumble is snizzle\".  This sentence combines both possibilities into a single statement.\n\nSince the original sentence already states both possibilities separately, we can indeed infer that it might be the case that both things are true. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
