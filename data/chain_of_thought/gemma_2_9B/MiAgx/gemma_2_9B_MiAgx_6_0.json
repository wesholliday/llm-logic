It seems to be suggesting a possible connection between \"wobble\" and \"flonk zizz\" and another connection between \"flimble\" and \"flibbit at zazzle snorkel\".  \n\nThe second sentence rephrases the original, making the connections more explicit. It states directly that \"it might be\" the wobble is flonk zizz and that the flimble \"flibbits\" at zazzle snorkel.\n\nSince the original sentence implies these connections, and the second sentence simply clarifies them, we can infer that the second sentence is a logical consequence of the first. \n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
