It uses \"might be\" which indicates possibility, not certainty.  The sentence connects two separate ideas: 1) the zump being quorple and 2) the snizzle wibbling froodle zibber.  \n\nThe second sentence rephrases the original, but it changes the word order and the connection between the two ideas.  \n\nThe original sentence implies that the zump being quorple *could be* related to the snizzle wibbling froodle zibber, but it doesn't explicitly state a causal relationship. The second sentence makes it sound like the two ideas are independent of each other.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
