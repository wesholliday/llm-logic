For example, a forgery could be incredibly well-made and fetch a high price.\n\nTherefore, while authenticity is a factor in determining worth, it's not the only factor.  We cannot definitively say that the artwork *must* be worth millions just because it *might* be authentic. \n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
