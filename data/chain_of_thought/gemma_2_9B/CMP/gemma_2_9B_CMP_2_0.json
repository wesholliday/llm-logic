    "user_prompt": "Suppose that banana bread, chocolate chip cookies, and carrot cake are the most popular baked goods. According to a consumer survey, it is very likely that banana bread will be the top seller, followed closely by chocolate chip cookies, with carrot cake far behind. These are the only top sellers, so if chocolate chip cookies aren\u2019t the top seller, then if banana bread isn\u2019t, carrot cake will be. Moreover, it is likely banana bread will be top and hence that chocolate chip cookies won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if banana bread isn\u2019t the top seller, carrot cake will be?",

It says that if two things happen (chocolate chip cookies not being top seller AND banana bread not being top seller), then a third thing will happen (carrot cake being the top seller).\n\n* **Analyzing Premise 3:** This premise tells us that it's likely banana bread will be the top seller, making it less likely that chocolate chip cookies will be.\n\n* **Connecting the Premises:**  Premise 3 weakens the possibility of the first part of Premise 2 happening (chocolate chip cookies not being the top seller).  \n\nSince Premise 3 makes it less likely that the first part of Premise 2 is true, it also makes the entire conditional statement in Premise 2 less likely to be true.  \n\nTherefore, we can't definitively say that it is likely that carrot cake will be the top seller if banana bread isn't.\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
