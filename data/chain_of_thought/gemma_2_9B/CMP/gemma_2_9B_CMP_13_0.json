    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

This doesn't mean it's guaranteed.  \n\nIf Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, Premise 3 tells us that Georgia won't either, and therefore Missouri would have to be the one with the most job growth.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does logically follow from the premises. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
