    "user_prompt": "Suppose that India, China, and Russia are the world's leading emerging economies. Economists project it's likely India's economy will grow the fastest this year, followed closely by China's, with Russia's growth rate lagging distantly behind. These are by far the biggest emerging economies, so if China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn\u2019t, Russia will be. Moreover, India's economy likely will grow the fastest of these three and hence China's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if India isn\u2019t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be?",

If India is indeed likely to be the fastest-growing, then the scenario where China is the fastest-growing and India isn't automatically triggers Russia as the next fastest-growing.\n\nTherefore, the argument's logic is flawed.\n\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
