    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it\u2019s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn\u2019t get the offer, then if Priya doesn\u2019t, Diego will. Moreover, it\u2019s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn\u2019t get the offer, Diego will?",

This means Julian is a necessary condition for Diego *not* getting the offer.\n* **Statement 3:** It's likely Priya will get the offer, meaning it's unlikely she won't.\n* **Conclusion:** Does it follow that if Priya doesn't get the offer, Diego will?\n\nWe know Priya is most likely to get the offer, and if she doesn't, Julian won't either.  This means if Priya doesn't get the offer, the only remaining candidate is Diego.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n\n\n",
