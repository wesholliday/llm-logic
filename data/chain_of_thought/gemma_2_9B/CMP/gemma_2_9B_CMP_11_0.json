    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Ford, Toyota, and Honda lead US auto sales. Industry analysis expects Ford will sell the most vehicles this year, followed closely by Toyota, with Honda lagging significantly behind. These brands lead the market, so if Toyota isn\u2019t #1 in sales, then if Ford isn\u2019t, Honda will be. Moreover, Ford likely will lead in sales and hence Toyota likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Ford doesn\u2019t lead in sales, Honda will?",

            "content": "\n\nThis is a logic puzzle that tests your ability to follow syllogistic reasoning. \n\nExplanation: \nLet's break down the statements:\n\n* **Premise 1:** Ford, Toyota, and Honda lead US auto sales.\n* **Premise 2:** Ford will likely sell the most vehicles this year, followed by Toyota, with Honda lagging significantly behind.\n* **Premise 3:** If Toyota isn\u2019t #1 in sales, then if Ford isn\u2019t, Honda will be.\n* **Premise 4:** Ford likely will lead in sales and hence Toyota likely won\u2019t.\n\nWe are asked to determine if it follows logically that if Ford doesn\u2019t lead in sales, Honda will.\n\nNotice that Premise 4 tells us Ford is likely to lead, and if they don't, Toyota won't. This means the scenario where Ford doesn't lead and Toyota doesn't lead is unlikely.  \n\nPremise 3 states that if Toyota isn't #1 and Ford isn't #1, then Honda must be #1.\n\nSince the scenario where Ford doesn't lead and Toyota doesn't lead is unlikely, it follows that the scenario where Ford doesn't lead and Honda does is also unlikely.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
