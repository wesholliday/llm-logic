    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Spain, Brazil, and England have the best chances to win the World Cup. Based on betting odds, it is most likely Spain will win, followed closely by Brazil, with England having much lower odds. These teams have the only realistic chances, so if Brazil doesn\u2019t win, then if Spain doesn\u2019t win, England will win. Moreover, it is likely Spain will win and hence that Brazil won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Spain doesn\u2019t win, England will?",

This is a conditional statement as well.\n\nWhile Premise 3 tells us England would win *if* both Brazil and Spain lose, it doesn't directly tell us how likely that scenario is.  Premise 4 makes it *more* likely that Spain will win, thus making it *less* likely that both Brazil and Spain will lose.\n\nTherefore, we can't definitively conclude that it is likely England will win if Spain doesn't win based on the given information.\n\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
