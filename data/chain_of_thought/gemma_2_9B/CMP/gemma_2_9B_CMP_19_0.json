    "user_prompt": "Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don\u2019t increase the most, then if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won\u2019t increase the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?",

This doesn't mean it's a certainty. There's still a possibility rents won't increase the most.\n\n* **Premise 3** sets a condition: If both home prices and rents don't increase the most, then mortgage rates will.\n\n* **The question asks:**  What's the likelihood of mortgage rates increasing the most *if* rents don't increase the most?\n\nSince we know rents *might* not increase the most, and Premise 3 states that if they don't, mortgage rates will increase the most, it's *possible* that mortgage rates will increase the most.\n\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
