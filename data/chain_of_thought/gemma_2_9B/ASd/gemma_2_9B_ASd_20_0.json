Here's why:\n\n* **The original statement makes a general claim:** It states that taking *any* medication will lead to feeling better. \n* **Expired medication is different:** Expired medication may have lost its potency or could even be harmful. \n* **The original statement doesn't specify the type of medication:** It's possible the original statement refers to a specific type of medication that might not apply to all medications.\n\nTherefore, the original statement doesn't provide enough information to support the conclusion that expired medication will make you feel better.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
