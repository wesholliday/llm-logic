However, the new statement introduces a condition, a \"shot transmission,\" which is a separate factor that could significantly impact the car's performance.  \n\nWhile changing the oil might help maintain the engine, it cannot fix a faulty transmission. A shot transmission would likely prevent the car from running smoothly regardless of the oil condition.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
