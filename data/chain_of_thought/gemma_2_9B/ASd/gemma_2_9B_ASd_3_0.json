This new condition creates a more complex scenario.  \n\nThe original statement doesn't tell us anything about what happens when the garage is flooding. It's possible that a flooding garage would make the car unsafe, even if it was originally safe.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that the car is safe just because it's in the garage and the garage is flooding. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
