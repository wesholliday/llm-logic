Other factors could be at play, such as overall calorie intake, metabolism, or genetics.\n\n* **The original statement is a conditional statement.** It establishes a relationship between two events (exercise and weight loss) but doesn't imply a relationship between exercise and other factors like diet.\n\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
