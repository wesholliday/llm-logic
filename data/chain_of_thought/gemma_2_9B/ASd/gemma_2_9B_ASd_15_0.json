This doesn't necessarily mean that *only* charging will result in it having power.  There could be other ways for a phone to have power, like starting with a charged battery.  \n\nThe second statement assumes that the phone starts with a dead battery, which isn't stated in the original.  Therefore, we can't definitively say that charging a phone with a dead battery *will* result in it having power. There could be other factors at play, like a faulty charger or a damaged battery.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
