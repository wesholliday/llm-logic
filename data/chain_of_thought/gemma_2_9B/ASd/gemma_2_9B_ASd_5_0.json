We don't know if the original statement applies in this more complex scenario. \n\nHere's why we can't definitively say yes:\n\n* **The original statement doesn't address what happens if the payment method fails.** It only states the outcome if the bill is paid. \n* **A bounced check implies the payment wasn't successful.**  Even though the bill was intended to be paid, the check bouncing means the service provider didn't actually receive the funds.\n\nTherefore, we can't be sure if the services would continue in this situation.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
