We don't know anything about the relationship between the pilot light and the kitchen's temperature.  \n\nThe original statement doesn't tell us whether the pilot light being out would affect whether the kitchen is warm or not. It's possible the kitchen could be warm even with the pilot light out if the oven is generating enough heat.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that 'If the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm' from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
