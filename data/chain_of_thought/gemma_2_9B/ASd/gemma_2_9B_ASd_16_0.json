However, the new statement introduces a condition, a drought, which could negatively impact the lawn's growth even with fertilizer.  \n\nFertilizer provides nutrients, but it doesn't make the lawn immune to environmental factors like lack of water. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that the lawn will be lush and green even with a drought.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
