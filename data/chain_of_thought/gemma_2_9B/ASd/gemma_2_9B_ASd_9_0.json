However, it doesn't say anything about what happens if the essay is both well-written *and* turned in late.  \n\nThe new statement adds a second condition (turned in late) that wasn't part of the original.  We can't assume that being late automatically negates the positive effect of a well-written essay.  There might be a late penalty, or the teacher might still give an A for exceptional work.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
