Here's why:\n\nThe original statement establishes a conditional relationship: if a certain condition (placing an order) is met, then a specific outcome (the item shipping) will occur.  \n\nHowever, it doesn't say anything about what happens if the item is out of stock.  The statement doesn't account for the possibility of the item not being available.\n\nTherefore, we can't assume that shipping will occur even if the order is placed and the item is out of stock.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
