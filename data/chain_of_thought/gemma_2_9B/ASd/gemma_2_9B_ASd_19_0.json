This means that if the gas tank is full, the car will run. However, it doesn't say anything about *necessary* conditions.  There could be other things besides a full gas tank that are needed for the car to run.\n\nA hole in the gas tank would prevent the car from running, even if it were full.  Therefore, the original statement doesn't guarantee that the car will run if there is a hole in the tank.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
