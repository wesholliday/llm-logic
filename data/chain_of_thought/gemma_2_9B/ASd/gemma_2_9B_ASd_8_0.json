In this case, P is \"the package has shipped\" and Q is \"it will arrive today.\"\n\nThe new statement is also a conditional statement, but it adds a new condition: \"and it was misrouted.\"  This means we're dealing with a more complex scenario.\n\nThe original statement doesn't tell us anything about what happens if the package is misrouted. It only tells us what happens if it's shipped.  Therefore, we can't infer that the package will arrive today even if it was misrouted.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
