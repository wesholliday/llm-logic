The statements given represent a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and a statement affirming the consequent (Q).  \n\nHere's why we can't conclude Sue chose pizza:\n\n* **Conditional Statement:** \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" means that if the first part (Sue chose pizza) is true, then the second part (Bob chose pasta) must also be true. It doesn't say anything about what happens if Bob chose pasta without Sue choosing pizza.\n\n* **Affirming the Consequent:** \"Bob chose pasta\" tells us that the second part of the conditional statement is true. However, it doesn't guarantee that the first part (Sue chose pizza) is also true.\n\n**Example:**\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n* If it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).\n* The ground is wet (Q).\n\nCan we conclude it's raining (P)? No! The ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, a burst pipe).\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
