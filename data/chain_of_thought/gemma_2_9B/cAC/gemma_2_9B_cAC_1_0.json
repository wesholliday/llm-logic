If P, then Q (where P and Q are propositions)\n2. P is true\n\nThen we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: Mary was at the wedding\n* Q: Sue was at the wedding\n\nWe are given:\n\n* Premise 1: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n* Premise 2: Sue was at the wedding.\n\nSince we know Sue was at the wedding (Premise 2), and we know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would have been there (Premise 1), we can logically conclude that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
