            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nLet's break down the logic here. We have two statements:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if one event (dog being inside) happens, then another event (cat being outside) must also happen.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The cat was outside.\" This is a factual statement.\n\nNow, we want to see if we can conclude that \"The dog was inside.\"  \n\nThe key here is to understand the nature of conditional statements.  A conditional statement doesn't automatically mean the reverse is true. Just because the cat was outside doesn't necessarily mean the dog was inside.  \n\nThink of it this way: the first statement only tells us what happens *if* the dog is inside. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the cat is outside. There could be other reasons why the cat was outside.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
