Modus Ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know that P is true, we can conclude that Q is also true.\n\nLet's break down the statements:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. (This is our conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** The wolf was in the den. (This tells us P is true)\n\nSince we know the wolf was in the den (P is true), and the first statement tells us that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf would be in the den, we can logically conclude that the bear must have been in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
