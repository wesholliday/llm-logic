(This is a conditional statement, often written as \"If P, then Q\")\n    * **Premise 2:** The book is a mystery novel. (This tells us Q is true)\n\n* **The Flaw:**\n\n    *  Affirming the consequent means assuming that because Q is true (the book is a mystery novel), then P must also be true (the book was written by James).  \n\n* **Counterexample:**\n\n    Imagine a different author, let's say Jane, also writes mystery novels.  In this case, the first premise would still hold true, but the conclusion wouldn't.\n\n**Answer:** no \n",
