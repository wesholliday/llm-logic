(This is a conditional statement)\n* **Premise 2:** Chris finished the race. (This is a factual statement)\n\nModus Ponens states that if we have a conditional statement and the consequent (the part after \"then\") is true, we can conclude that the antecedent (the part before \"then\") is also true.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* The conditional statement is \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\"\n* The consequent is \"Chris finished the race.\"\n* Since the consequent is true, we can conclude that the antecedent, \"Alex finished the race,\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n\n\n",
