If P, then Q (This is our first statement)\n    2. P is true (This is our second statement)\n\n*Then we can conclude that Q is true.\n\n* In our case:\n\n    1. P = The griffin was in the forest\n    2. Q = The unicorn was in the forest\n\n    We are given:\n\n    1. If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n    2. The unicorn was in the forest.\n\n* Since the second premise (The unicorn was in the forest) matches Q in our modus ponens structure, we can conclude that the first premise (The griffin was in the forest) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
