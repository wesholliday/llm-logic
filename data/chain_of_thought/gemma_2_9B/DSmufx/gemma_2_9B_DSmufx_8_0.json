If the sprocket must be daggled (as per Statement 1), then Statement 2 would be false.\n\n2. Since Statement 2 is true (it's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled), the first part of Statement 1 must be false.\n\n3. If the first part of Statement 1 is false, then the second part must be true, as the disjunction requires at least one of the alternatives to be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes \n\n\n",
