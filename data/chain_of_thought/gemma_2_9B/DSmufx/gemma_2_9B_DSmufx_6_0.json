It doesn't say *both* are true, just that one of them *must* be true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped.\" This is the negation of the first part of Statement 1.\n\nSince Statement 2 tells us the first part of Statement 1 is false (the grommet doesn't *must* be plopped), the only remaining possibility from Statement 1 is that the grommet *must* be sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
