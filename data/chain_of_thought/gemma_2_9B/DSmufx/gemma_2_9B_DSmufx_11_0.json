It doesn't say both can't be true, just that at least one must be.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed.\" This is a negation of the first part of the disjunction in Statement 1.\n\nNow, if we combine these statements, we see that the first part of the disjunction (flug must be zimmed) is ruled out.  Since the disjunction must be true (either one of the options must hold), the only remaining possibility is that the flug is blummed. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
