It says that if a certain condition (being shanked) is true, then a consequence (tinkling) will follow.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"The whiffle did not tink.\"  \n\nSince the whiffle was not shanked (Statement 1), the condition in Statement 2 is false.  Because the condition is false, the consequence (tinkling) doesn't have to be true or false.  The conditional statement doesn't tell us anything about what happens when the condition is false.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
