It says that if the clug *were* fleeked, then it would also be snugged.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can conclude that \"The clug was not snugged.\"  \n\nSince the clug was not fleeked (Statement 1), the conditional statement (Statement 2) doesn't actually tell us anything about whether or not it was snugged.  The conditional only applies if the clug *were* fleeked.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
