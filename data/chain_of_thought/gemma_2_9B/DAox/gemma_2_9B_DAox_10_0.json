We're dealing with a conditional statement and a negation.\n\n* **Premise 1:** \"The wug was not sproinged.\" This tells us the wug definitely did *not* undergo the action of being sproinged.\n\n* **Premise 2:** \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\" This is a conditional statement. It says that if the wug *were* sproinged, then it would necessarily also be garpled.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can conclude \"The wug was not garpled.\"  \n\nThink about it this way:\n\n* If the wug *were* sproinged, it *would* be garpled (according to Premise 2).\n* But we know the wug *was not* sproinged (Premise 1).\n\nSince the wug wasn't sproinged, the condition in Premise 2 doesn't apply.  Therefore, we can't conclude anything about whether or not it was garpled. The information about garpling is only relevant if the wug had been sproinged.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
