(Not P)\n* **Premise 2:** If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked. (If P, then Q)\n\nApplying Modus Tollens, since we know the first premise is true (the splat was not morphed), and we have the second premise stating that if it *were* morphed, it would quank, we can logically conclude that the splat did not quank.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
