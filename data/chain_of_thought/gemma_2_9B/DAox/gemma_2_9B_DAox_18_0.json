It says that if the first part (the shank was plooked) is true, then the second part (the shank was nugged) must also be true.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"The shank was not nugged\" from these statements.  \n\nSince we know the shank was *not* plooked (Statement 1), the first part of the conditional statement (If the shank was plooked) is false.  Because the first part is false, the entire conditional statement doesn't have to be true or false. It doesn't tell us anything about whether the shank was nugged or not.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
