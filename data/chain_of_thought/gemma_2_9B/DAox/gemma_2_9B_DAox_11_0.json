It says that if a certain condition (blummed) is true, then another condition (zimmed) must also be true.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"The flug was not zimmed.\"  \n\nSince the first statement tells us the flug was *not* blummed, the conditional statement (Statement 2) doesn't apply.  The \"if\" part of the conditional statement is false, so we can't conclude anything about the \"then\" part.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
