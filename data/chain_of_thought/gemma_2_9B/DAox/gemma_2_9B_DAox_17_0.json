We have two statements:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** The flob was not skizzled.\n2. **Premise 2:** If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude that \"The flob was not movated.\" This is an example of a logical argument called *modus tollens*.\n\n*Modus tollens* works like this:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's apply this to our flob scenario:\n\n* P: The flob was skizzled.\n* Q: The flob movated.\n\n* Premise 1: Not P (The flob was not skizzled)\n* Premise 2: If P, then Q (If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated)\n\nSince we know the flob was not skizzled (not P), and we know that if it *were* skizzled, it would be movated, we can conclude that it must not be movated.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
