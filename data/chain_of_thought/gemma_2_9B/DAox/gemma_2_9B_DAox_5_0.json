It says that if the zinger *were* fraggled, then it would also be smoogled.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can conclude that \"The zinger was not smoogled.\"  \n\nSince we know the zinger is *not* fraggled (Statement 1), the conditional statement (Statement 2) doesn't directly apply.  The \"if\" part of the conditional statement is not met.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively say whether or not the zinger was smoogled. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
