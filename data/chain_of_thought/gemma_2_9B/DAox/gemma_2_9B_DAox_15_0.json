It says that if the dreb were to be vroombed, it would also be spened.  \n\nNow, we want to know if we can conclude that \"The dreb was not spened.\"\n\nSince the first statement tells us the dreb was *not* vroombed, the conditional statement (Statement 2) doesn't apply.  The \"if\" part of the conditional is not met.  \n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively say whether or not the dreb was spened. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
