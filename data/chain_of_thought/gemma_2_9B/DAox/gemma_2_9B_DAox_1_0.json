It says that if the flugel *were* blimmed, then it would also be zargled.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can conclude that \"The flugel was not zargled.\"\n\nSince the flugel wasn't blimmed (Statement 1), the condition in Statement 2 is not met.  Therefore, we can't conclude that the flugel was zargled.  We also can't conclude that it wasn't zargled.\n\nAnswer: no \n\n\n",
