We have two statements:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** \"The twonk was not plinked.\"\n2. **Premise 2:** \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\"\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The twonk was not varnished.\"  This is a classic example of a logical argument structure called *modus tollens*.\n\n*Modus tollens* works like this:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's apply this to our twonk problem:\n\n* P: The twonk was plinked.\n* Q: The twonk was varnished.\n\n* Premise 1: Not P (The twonk was not plinked)\n* Premise 2: If P, then Q (If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished)\n\nSince we know the twonk wasn't plinked (not P), and we know that if it *were* plinked, it would be varnished, we can conclude that it must not be varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
