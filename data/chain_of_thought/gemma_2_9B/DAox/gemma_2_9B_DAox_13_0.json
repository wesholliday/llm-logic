We have two statements:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** \"The glip was not slogged.\"\n2. **Premise 2:** \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\"\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The glip was not tragged.\"  This is a classic example of a logical argument structure called *modus tollens*.\n\n*Modus tollens* works like this:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's apply this to our glip problem:\n\n* P: The glip was slogged.\n* Q: The glip was tragged.\n\n* Premise 1:  The glip was not slogged (Not P)\n* Premise 2: If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged (If P, then Q)\n\nSince we know the glip was not slogged (Not P), and we know that if it *were* slogged, it would be tragged, we can conclude that it cannot be tragged.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
