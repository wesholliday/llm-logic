Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that states:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down our statements:\n\n* P: The fleeg was bluttered.\n* Q: It surned.\n\n* Statement 1: The fleeg was not bluttered. (This is our \"Not P\")\n* Statement 2: If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned. (This is our \"If P, then Q\")\n\nSince we have the structure of Modus Tollens, we can apply it:\n\n* If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\n* The fleeg was not bluttered.\n* Therefore, the fleeg did not surn. \n\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
