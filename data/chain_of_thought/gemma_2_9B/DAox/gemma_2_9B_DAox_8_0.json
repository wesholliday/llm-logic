It implies that cranking the sprocket is a *sufficient* condition for the sprocket to be daggled.  \n\nNow, we want to know if we can conclude \"The sprocket was not daggled.\"\n\nSince the first statement tells us the sprocket wasn't cranked, the second statement doesn't apply. The second statement only tells us what happens *if* the sprocket *was* cranked. It doesn't say anything about what happens if it wasn't cranked.\n\nTherefore, we can't definitively say whether or not the sprocket was daggled. It could be daggled for other reasons, or it could not be daggled at all.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
