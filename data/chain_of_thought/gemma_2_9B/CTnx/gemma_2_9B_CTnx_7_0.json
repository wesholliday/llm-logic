            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nThis question asks about the relationship between two conditional statements.  The original statement is:\n\n* If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle did not tink.\n\nThis can be represented symbolically as:\n\n* P -> ~Q\n\nWhere:\n\n* P = The whiffle was shanked\n* Q = The whiffle tinked\n\nWe want to know if we can infer:\n\n* If the whiffle tinked, then the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nThis can be represented as:\n\n* Q -> ~P\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe original statement is a conditional statement.  A conditional statement is only false if the hypothesis (the part before the \"then\") is true and the conclusion (the part after the \"then\") is false.  \n\nThe converse of a conditional statement is formed by swapping the hypothesis and the conclusion.  The converse of a conditional statement is not always logically equivalent to the original statement.  \n\nIn this case, the original statement does not guarantee that if the whiffle tinked, then it was not shanked.  \n\nFor example, there could be other reasons why a whiffle might not tink besides it being shanked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
