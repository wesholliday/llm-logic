In all other cases, it's true.\n* **Q \u2192 \u00acP:** This statement is only false when Q is true and \u00acP is true (meaning P is false).\n\nNotice that these conditions for falsity are different.  \n\n**Therefore, P \u2192 \u00acQ is not logically equivalent to Q \u2192 \u00acP.**\n\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
