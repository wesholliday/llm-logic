The original statement is:\n\n* If the twonk was plinked, then it was not varnished.\n\nThis can be represented symbolically as:\n\n* P \u2192 \u00acV  (where P = \"the twonk was plinked\" and V = \"the twonk was varnished\")\n\nWe want to know if we can infer:\n\n* If the twonk was varnished, then the twonk was not plinked.\n\nThis can be represented as:\n\n* V \u2192 \u00acP\n\nLet's analyze the relationship:\n\nThe original statement (P \u2192 \u00acV)  tells us that if something is plinked, it cannot be varnished.  The statement we want to infer (V \u2192 \u00acP)  says that if something is varnished, it cannot be plinked.  These statements are logically equivalent.  They express the same relationship just in reverse.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n\n\n",
