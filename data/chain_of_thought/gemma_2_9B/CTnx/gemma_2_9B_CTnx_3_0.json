The original statement is:\n\n* If the splat was morphed, then the splat did not quank.\n\nThis can be represented symbolically as:\n\n* P -> ~Q\n\nWhere:\n\n* P = \"The splat was morphed\"\n* Q = \"The splat quanked\"\n\nWe want to know if we can infer:\n\n* If the splat quanked, then the splat was not morphed.\n\nThis can be represented as:\n\n* Q -> ~P\n\nLet's analyze the relationship:\n\nThe original statement (P -> ~Q) states that if P is true, then Q must be false.  The statement we want to infer (Q -> ~P) states that if Q is true, then P must be false.  These are logically equivalent statements.\n\n**Answer:** yes \n\n\n",
