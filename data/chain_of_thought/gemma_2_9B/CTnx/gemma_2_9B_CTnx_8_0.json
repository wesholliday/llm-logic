            "content": "\n\nExplanation: \nThis question tests our understanding of logical implication and its inverse. \n\n* **Original statement:** \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled.\"  This can be represented symbolically as P -> ~Q, where P is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and Q is \"the sprocket was daggled.\"\n\n* **Inverse statement:** \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\" This can be represented as Q -> ~P.\n\n* **Relationship:** The original statement and its inverse are not logically equivalent.  The original statement says that if something is cranked, it's not daggled.  The inverse says that if something is daggled, it's not cranked. These are related but not necessarily true in the same situations.\n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine a scenario where a sprocket can be both cranked and daggled.  The original statement wouldn't hold true in this case, and neither would its inverse.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
