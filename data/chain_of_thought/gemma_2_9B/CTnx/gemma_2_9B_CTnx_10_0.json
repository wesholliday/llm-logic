            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nThis question tests our understanding of logical implication and its inverse. \n\n* **Original statement:** \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was not garpled.\"  This can be represented symbolically as P \u2192 \u00acQ, where P is \"the wug was sproinged\" and Q is \"the wug was garpled.\"\n\n* **Inverse statement:** \"If the wug was garpled, then the wug was not sproinged.\" This can be represented as Q \u2192 \u00acP.\n\n* **Relationship:** The original statement and its inverse are not logically equivalent.  The original statement says that sproinging *prevents* garpling. The inverse says that garpling *prevents* sproinging. These are not necessarily the same thing.\n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine a scenario where wugs can be both sproinged and garpled.  The original statement would still hold true, but the inverse would be false.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
