The original statement says that if something is blimmed, it can't be zargled. The inverse says that if something is zargled, it can't be blimmed. These are related but not necessarily true in the same situations.\n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine a scenario where some flugels can be both blimmed and zargled.  The original statement wouldn't hold true in this case. However, the inverse statement might still be true.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
