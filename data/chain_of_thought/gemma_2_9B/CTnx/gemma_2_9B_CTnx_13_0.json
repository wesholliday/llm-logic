We need to determine if the original statement's logic can be reversed without changing its truth value.\n\nThe original statement is a conditional statement:\n\n* **If P, then Q** (If the glip was slogged, then the glip was not tragged)\n\nWe want to know if the converse of this statement is also true:\n\n* **If Q, then P** (If the glip was tragged, then the glip was not slogged)\n\nThe converse of a conditional statement is not always logically equivalent to the original statement.  \n\nConsider a simple example:\n\n* If it is raining, then the ground is wet. (Original statement)\n* If the ground is wet, then it is raining. (Converse)\n\nThe converse is not always true. The ground could be wet for other reasons besides rain.\n\nIn our glip example, we don't have enough information to determine if the converse is true.  It's possible that a glip could be tragged without being slogged.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
