It says that if a certain condition (being vreebled) is true, then a specific outcome (not plagged) will always follow.\n\n**Statement 2:** If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled.\n\n* This statement is the reverse of the first. It suggests that if a different condition (plagged) is true, then the opposite outcome (not vreebled) will always follow.\n\n**The Key:**\n\nThe relationship between these statements is called **contrapositive**. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by:\n\n1. **Reversing the hypothesis and conclusion.**\n2. **Negating both the hypothesis and conclusion.**\n\nLet's see how this applies to our example:\n\n* **Original Statement 1:** If P, then Q (If smonk was vreebled, then smonk did not plagged)\n* **Contrapositive of Statement 1:** If not Q, then not P (If smonk was not plagged, then smonk was not vreebled)\n\nNotice that Statement 2 is the contrapositive of Statement 1.\n\n**Answer:** yes \n\n\n",
