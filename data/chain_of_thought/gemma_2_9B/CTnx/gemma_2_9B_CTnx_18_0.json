            "content": "\n\nExplanation: \nThis question deals with logical reasoning and specifically with the relationship between conditional statements. \n\nLet's break down the original statement:\n\n* **\"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was not nugged.\"**  This statement sets up a conditional relationship. It says that if a certain condition (shank being plooked) is true, then another condition (shank not being nugged) must also be true.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can reverse this relationship and conclude:\n\n* **\"If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\"**\n\nThis is where the concept of contrapositive comes in. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by:\n\n1.  Reversing the hypothesis and conclusion.\n2.  Negating both the hypothesis and conclusion.\n\nLet's apply this to our original statement:\n\n* **Original statement:** If p, then not q.\n* **Contrapositive:** If not q, then not p.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* **Original:** If shank was plooked, then shank was not nugged.\n* **Contrapositive:** If shank was nugged, then shank was not plooked.\n\n**Therefore, the original statement logically implies its contrapositive.**\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
