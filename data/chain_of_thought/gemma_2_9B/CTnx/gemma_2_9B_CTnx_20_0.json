            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nThis question asks about the logical relationship between two conditional statements.  We need to determine if the original statement's logic allows us to conclude the reverse.\n\nLet's break down the original statement:\n\n* **If the fleeg was bluttered, then it did not surn.**  This can be represented symbolically as:\n\n   * P -> ~Q  (where P = \"the fleeg was bluttered\" and Q = \"the fleeg surned\")\n\nNow, we want to see if this implies:\n\n* **If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered.**  This can be represented as:\n\n   * Q -> ~P\n\nThese two statements are **not logically equivalent**.  The original statement tells us that bluttering *prevents* surning. It doesn't say anything about what happens if surning occurs.  \n\nFor example, there could be other reasons why a fleeg might surn besides it not being bluttered.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
