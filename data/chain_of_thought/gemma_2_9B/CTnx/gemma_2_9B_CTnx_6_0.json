The original statement (P \u2192 \u00acQ)  tells us that if P is true, then Q must be false.  The statement we want to infer (Q \u2192 \u00acP)  says that if Q is true, then P must be false.  These are logically related, but not necessarily equivalent.\n\n**Consider a counterexample:**\n\nImagine a scenario where the grommet was never sploffed (P is false). In this case, the original statement (P \u2192 \u00acQ) is automatically true (because the \"if\" part is false). However, it doesn't tell us anything about whether or not the grommet plopped the frink (Q).  The grommet could have plopped the frink or not.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWe cannot definitively infer Q \u2192 \u00acP from P \u2192 \u00acQ. \n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
