It tells us something about what happens *if* the sneg is crampled. It doesn't tell us anything about what happens *if* the sneg sproted the frink.  \n\nTo see why we can't infer the second statement, consider these possibilities:\n\n* **Possibility 1:** The sneg could be crampled, and it could also sproted the frink.  The original statement doesn't rule this out.\n* **Possibility 2:** The sneg could be not crampled, and it could sproted the frink.  The original statement doesn't tell us anything about this case.\n\nSince the original statement doesn't provide enough information to rule out these possibilities, we cannot infer the second statement.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
