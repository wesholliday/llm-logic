            "content": "\\\nExplanation: \nThis question tests our understanding of logical implication and its inverse. \n\n* **Original Statement:** \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was not spened.\"  This can be represented symbolically as P -> ~Q, where P is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and Q is \"the dreb was spened.\"\n\n* **Inverse Statement:** \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed.\" This can be represented as Q -> ~P.\n\n* **Relationship:** The original statement and its inverse are not logically equivalent.  The original statement says that if something is vroombed, it cannot be spened. The inverse says that if something is spened, it cannot be vroombed. These are different conditions.\n\n* **Counterexample:**  Imagine a scenario where drebs can be both vroombed and spened.  The original statement wouldn't be violated, but the inverse would be false.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
