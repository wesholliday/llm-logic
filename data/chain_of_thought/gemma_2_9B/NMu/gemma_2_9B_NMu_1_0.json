It leaves open the possibility that she wasn't there.\n\nNow, consider \"Mary might not have been at the wedding.\" This statement expresses uncertainty about Mary's presence at the wedding.\n\nSince the original statement already rules out the certainty of Mary's attendance, it logically follows that there's a possibility she wasn't there.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
