It leaves open the possibility that the alien did or did not visit Mars.\n\nNow, let's consider the proposed inference: \"The alien might not have visited Mars.\" This statement also suggests that the alien's visit to Mars is uncertain.\n\nSince the original statement already implies uncertainty about the alien's visit to Mars, the proposed inference logically follows. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
