This is a conditional statement, meaning it proposes a cause-and-effect relationship.\n\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the pants must have been denim. This premise negates the consequence of the conditional statement in Premise 1.\n\n* **Conclusion:** The shirt was not cotton. This is the conclusion we are trying to determine if the premises logically support.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion. If the first premise were true, and the second premise were also true, it would mean that the pants were not denim.  Since the pants not being denim contradicts the first premise (which states that if the shirt was cotton, the pants *must* have been denim), it follows logically that the shirt could not have been cotton.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
