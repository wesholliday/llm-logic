This is a conditional statement, meaning it asserts that if one event (dog inside) happens, then another event (cat outside) must also happen.\n\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the cat must have been outside. This premise negates the consequent of the conditional statement in Premise 1. It's saying that we can't definitively say the cat was outside.\n\n* **Conclusion:** The dog was not inside. This is the conclusion we're trying to determine if the premises logically support.\n\nNow, let's think about the implications of the premises. If Premise 1 were true, and the cat wasn't outside (as stated in Premise 2), then the antecedent of Premise 1 (the dog being inside) must be false. This is because the conditional statement only holds if the antecedent is true and the consequent is also true.\n\nTherefore, the argument's structure leads us to the conclusion that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
