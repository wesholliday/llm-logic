            "content": "\n\nExplanation: \nLet's break down the argument and analyze its structure.\n\n* **Premise 1:** If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. This is a conditional statement, meaning it asserts that one event (Tom watching football) implies another (Jen watching basketball).\n\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. This premise negates the consequent of the conditional statement in Premise 1.\n\n* **Conclusion:** Tom did not watch football. This is the conclusion we are trying to determine if the premises logically support.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion.  If Premise 1 were true, and Premise 2 were also true, it would mean that the original conditional statement (If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball) is false.  A conditional statement is only false when the antecedent (Tom watching football) is true, and the consequent (Jen watching basketball) is false.\n\nSince Premise 2 tells us that Jen *must not* have watched basketball, this means the consequent of Premise 1 is false. Therefore, the only way for the entire conditional statement in Premise 1 to be false is if the antecedent (Tom watching football) is also false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
