It sets up a relationship where the truth of the first part (apple being red) implies the truth of the second part (banana being yellow).\n\n* **Premise 2:** \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\" This premise tells us that the truth of the banana being yellow is not guaranteed.\n\n* **Conclusion:** \"The apple was not red.\" This is the statement we want to determine if the premises logically support.\n\nNow, let's think about the implications:\n\nIf the first premise were true, and the apple *was* red, then the banana *must* have been yellow. However, the second premise tells us that the banana's color is not a certainty. This means the first premise cannot be true, because if it were, the second premise would be contradicted.\n\nTherefore, the only way to reconcile the premises is if the first premise is false.  A false conditional statement means that the antecedent (apple being red) is not necessarily linked to the consequent (banana being yellow). This, in turn, means the apple could not have been red.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
