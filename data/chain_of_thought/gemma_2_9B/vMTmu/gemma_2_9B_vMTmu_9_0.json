This is a conditional statement, meaning it asserts that one event (Lisa buying the red shirt) implies another event (Mark buying the blue shirt).\n\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This premise negates the consequence of the conditional statement in Premise 1.\n\n* **Conclusion:** Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This is the conclusion we are trying to determine if the premises logically support.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion. If Premise 2 is true (Mark does not *must* buy the blue shirt), then it means the conditional statement in Premise 1 cannot be true.  If the conditional statement is not true, then the antecedent (Lisa buying the red shirt) must also be false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the truth of the premises necessarily leads to the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
