This is a conditional statement, meaning it asserts that if one event (Sam taking a plane) happens, then another event (Erin taking a train) must also happen.\n\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train. This premise negates the consequent of the conditional statement in Premise 1. It's saying that there's no guarantee that Erin took a train, even if Sam took a plane.\n\n* **Conclusion:** Sam did not take a plane. This is the conclusion we're trying to determine if the argument supports.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion.  If Premise 2 is true (Erin didn't *have* to take a train), then it means Premise 1 cannot be true in its entirety. If Premise 1 were true, then Erin *must* have taken a train, contradicting Premise 2.  Therefore, the only way for both premises to be true is if Premise 1 is false, which means Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
