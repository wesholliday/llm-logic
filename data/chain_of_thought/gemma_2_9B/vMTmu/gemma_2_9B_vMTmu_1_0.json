This is a conditional statement, meaning it asserts that if the first part (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true.\n\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. This premise essentially negates the conclusion that Sue's presence at the wedding is guaranteed.\n\n* **Conclusion:** Mary was not at the wedding. This is the statement we want to determine if the argument supports.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion.  Premise 1 sets up a connection between Mary's presence and Sue's presence. Premise 2 weakens that connection by stating that Sue's presence is not a certainty.  \n\nThe argument's structure resembles a form of *modus tollens*, a valid argument form. Modus tollens states:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: Mary was at the wedding\n* Q: Sue must have been at the wedding\n\nPremise 1 is our \"If P, then Q\" statement. Premise 2 is the \"Not Q\" statement.  Therefore, the argument follows the structure of modus tollens.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
