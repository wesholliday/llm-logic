This is a conditional statement, meaning it asserts that if one event (the vampire being awake) occurs, then another event (the mummy being awake) must also occur.\n\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake. This premise negates the consequent of the conditional statement in Premise 1.\n\n* **Conclusion:** The vampire was not awake. This is the conclusion we are trying to determine if the premises logically support.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion.  If the mummy did not have to be awake (Premise 2), then it's possible that the vampire was not awake and the mummy wasn't either. This aligns with the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
