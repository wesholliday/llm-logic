This is a conditional statement, meaning it proposes a cause-and-effect relationship.\n\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry. This premise negates the consequence of the conditional statement in Premise 1.\n\n* **Conclusion:** The cake was not chocolate. This is the conclusion we are trying to determine if the premises logically support.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion. If the muffins did *not* have to be blueberry, then the original conditional statement (Premise 1) cannot be true.  This is because if the cake *was* chocolate, the muffins *must* have been blueberry according to Premise 1. Since this isn't the case, the antecedent (the cake being chocolate) must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
