This is a conditional statement, often written as \"If P, then Q\". Here, P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book must be a mystery novel\".\n\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel. This means the book could be something other than a mystery novel.\n\n* **Conclusion:** The book was not written by James.\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.  Premise 1 tells us that IF James wrote the book, THEN it's a mystery. Premise 2 tells us the book is NOT necessarily a mystery.  This doesn't directly say James didn't write it, just that the book doesn't have to be a mystery.\n\nTo make a valid argument, we need to show that the premises *guarantee* the conclusion. In this case, the premises don't do that. It's possible the book is a mystery written by someone other than James.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
