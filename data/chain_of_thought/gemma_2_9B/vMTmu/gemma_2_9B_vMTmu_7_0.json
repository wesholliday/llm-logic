This is a conditional statement, meaning it asserts that if one event (Alex finishing) happens, then another event (Chris finishing) must also happen.\n\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race. This premise is essentially saying that we cannot definitively conclude that Chris finished the race.\n\n* **Conclusion:** Alex did not finish the race. This is the claim we want to see if the premises support.\n\nNow, let's think about how the premises relate to the conclusion.  Premise 1 sets up a scenario where if Alex finishes, Chris *must* finish. However, Premise 2 tells us we can't be sure Chris finished.  This means it's possible Alex didn't finish, because if Alex didn't finish, the condition in Premise 1 wouldn't apply, and we wouldn't be able to say Chris *must* have finished.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
