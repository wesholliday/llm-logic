This is a conditional statement, meaning it asserts that one event (the bear being in the cave) implies another event (the wolf being in the den).\n\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den. This premise negates the consequent of the conditional statement in Premise 1.\n\n* **Conclusion:** The bear was not in the cave. This is the conclusion we are trying to determine if the premises logically support.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion.  If the first premise were true, and the second premise were also true, it would mean that the condition in the first premise (the bear being in the cave) could not be met. Why? Because if the bear were in the cave, it would necessitate the wolf being in the den, which we are told is not a necessity.\n\nTherefore, the argument structure suggests that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
