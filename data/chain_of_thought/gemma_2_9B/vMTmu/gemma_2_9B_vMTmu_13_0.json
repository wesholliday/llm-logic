If the truck did *not* have to be blue, then the original conditional statement (Premise 1) cannot be true.  This is because a conditional statement is only false if the antecedent (the car being red) is true and the consequent (the truck being blue) is false.\n\nTherefore, since the second premise undermines the truth of the first premise, the conclusion that the car was not red must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
