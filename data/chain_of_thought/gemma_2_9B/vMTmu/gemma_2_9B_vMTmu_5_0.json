This is a conditional statement, meaning it asserts that one event (Jeff playing basketball) would necessarily lead to another event (Amy playing tennis).\n\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis. This premise negates the consequence of the conditional statement in Premise 1. It tells us that Amy playing tennis is not a guaranteed outcome.\n\n* **Conclusion:** Jeff did not play basketball. This is the conclusion we are trying to determine if the premises logically support.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion.  If Amy did not have to play tennis (Premise 2), then it's possible that Jeff did not play basketball (Conclusion).  The argument's structure is designed to exploit this possibility.\n\nAnswer: \nyes \n",
