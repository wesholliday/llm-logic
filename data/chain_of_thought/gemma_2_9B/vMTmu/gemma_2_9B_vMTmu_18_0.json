This is a conditional statement, meaning it proposes a relationship where one event (the doll being plastic) leads to another (the truck being metal).\n\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the truck must have been metal. This premise negates the consequence of the conditional statement in Premise 1.\n\n* **Conclusion:** The doll was not plastic. This is the conclusion we are trying to determine if the premises logically support.\n\nNow, let's think about the implications:\n\nIf Premise 1 were true, and the truck was not metal (as stated in Premise 2), then the antecedent (the doll being plastic) of the conditional statement in Premise 1 must be false.  This is because a conditional statement is only false when its antecedent is true and its consequent is false.\n\nTherefore, the argument's structure leads us to the conclusion that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
