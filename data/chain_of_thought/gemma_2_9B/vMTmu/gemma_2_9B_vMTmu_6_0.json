This is a conditional statement (if P, then Q).\n\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta. This means there's a possibility Bob didn't choose pasta.\n\n* **Conclusion:** Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nNow, to determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.  \n\nIf we assume the first premise is true, it means that if Sue chose pizza, Bob *must* choose pasta. However, the second premise tells us that Bob doesn't *have* to choose pasta. This means there's a scenario where Sue could have chosen pizza, and Bob chose something else.\n\nSince the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premises, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no \n",
