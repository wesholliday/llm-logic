This is a conditional statement, meaning it asserts that one event (Joe going to the park) implies another event (Lucy going to the zoo).\n\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This premise negates the consequence of the conditional statement in Premise 1.\n\n* **Conclusion:** Joe did not go to the park. This is the conclusion we are trying to determine if the premises logically support.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion.  If Lucy did *not* have to go to the zoo (Premise 2), then it means that the condition in Premise 1 (Joe going to the park) might not be necessary for Lucy to go to the zoo. This opens the possibility that Joe could have gone to the park without Lucy going to the zoo.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not necessarily invalid. It's possible for Joe to have gone to the park, but the premises don't provide enough information to definitively say that he did or did not.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n",
