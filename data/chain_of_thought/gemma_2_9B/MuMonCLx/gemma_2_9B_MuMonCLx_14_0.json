This statement implies that the zooble is zibber for both a blimple and a wump.  To infer \"The zooble must be zibber for a blimple\" we need to determine if the original statement supports this conclusion.  Since the original statement explicitly states the zooble is zibber for a blimple, the inference is valid. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
