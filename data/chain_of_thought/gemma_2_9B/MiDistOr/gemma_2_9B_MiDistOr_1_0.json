The envelope is under a bed.\n\nThe phrase \"or\" indicates that either one of these possibilities could be true.  \n\nThe rephrased statement \"The envelope might be upstairs or it might be under a bed\" essentially repeats the same information using slightly different wording.  It breaks down the original \"or\" into two separate \"might\" statements, but the meaning remains the same.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
