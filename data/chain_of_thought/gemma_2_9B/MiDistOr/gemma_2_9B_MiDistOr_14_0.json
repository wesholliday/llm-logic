The contract could be renewable.\n\nThe phrase doesn't explicitly state that these two possibilities are mutually exclusive. It's possible for a contract to be valid for a year *and* be renewable.  \n\nTherefore, we can infer that the contract might be valid for a year *or* it might be renewable.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
