If P, then Q (where P and Q are propositions)\n2. P is true\n\nThen we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The apple was red\n* Q: The banana was yellow\n\nWe are given:\n\n* If P, then Q (If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow) is true.\n* P is true (The banana was yellow)\n\nSince the second premise is true, and the first premise establishes a conditional relationship, we can apply Modus Ponens to conclude that Q is true.\n\nAnswer: \n",
