Maybe she went with a friend, or maybe she had a special reason to visit.\n\n**Think of it this way:**\n\nIf it rains, the ground gets wet. (If P, then Q)\n\nThe ground is wet. (Q is true)\n\nDoes it *necessarily* follow that it rained? No, the ground could be wet for other reasons (like someone spilled water).\n\n\nAnswer: no \n",
