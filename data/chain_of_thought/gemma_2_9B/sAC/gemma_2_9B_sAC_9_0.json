If P, then Q (where P and Q are propositions)\n2. P is true\n\nThen we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: Lisa bought the red shirt\n* Q: Mark bought the blue shirt\n\nWe are given:\n\n* If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt (Premise 1)\n* Mark bought the blue shirt (Premise 2)\n\nSince Premise 2 (Q) is true, and we have Premise 1, we can apply Modus Ponens to conclude that P (Lisa bought the red shirt) is also true. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
