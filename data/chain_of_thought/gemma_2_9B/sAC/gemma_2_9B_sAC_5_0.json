If P, then Q (where P and Q are propositions)\n2. P is true\n\nThen we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: Jeff played basketball\n* Q: Amy played tennis\n\nWe are given:\n\n* If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis (If P, then Q)\n* Amy played tennis (P is true)\n\nTherefore, according to Modus Ponens, we can conclude that Jeff played basketball. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
