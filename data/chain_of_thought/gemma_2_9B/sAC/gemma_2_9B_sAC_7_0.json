If P, then Q (where P and Q are propositions)\n2. P is true\n\nThen we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: Alex finished the race\n* Q: Chris finished the race\n\nWe are given:\n\n* If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race (P -> Q is true)\n* Chris finished the race (Q is true)\n\nTherefore, according to Modus Ponens, we can conclude that Alex finished the race (P is true).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
