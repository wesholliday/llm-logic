If P, then Q (where P and Q are propositions)\n2. P is true\n\nThen we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nIn our case:\n\n1. P: The doll was plastic\n2. Q: The truck was metal\n3. We are given that \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" (P -> Q) is true.\n4. We are also given that \"The truck was metal\" (Q) is true.\n\nTherefore, according to Modus Ponens, we can conclude that \"The doll was plastic\" (P) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
