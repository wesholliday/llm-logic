It sets up a cause-and-effect relationship:\n\n    * **Hypothesis (Antecedent):** The shirt was cotton.\n    * **Conclusion (Consequent):** The pants were denim.\n\n* **Affirming the Consequent:**  The problem arises when we assume that because the conclusion (pants were denim) is true, the hypothesis (shirt was cotton) must also be true. This is incorrect.\n\n* **Counterexamples:**  There could be other reasons why the pants were denim.  Maybe the pants were always denim, regardless of the shirt's material.\n\n**Answer:** no \n",
