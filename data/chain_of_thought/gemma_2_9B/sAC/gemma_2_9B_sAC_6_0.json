If P, then Q (where P and Q are propositions)\n2. P is true\n\nThen we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: Sue chose pizza\n* Q: Bob chose pasta\n\nWe are given:\n\n* If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta (If P, then Q)\n* Bob chose pasta (P is true)\n\nTherefore, we can apply Modus Ponens and conclude that Sue chose pizza (Q is true).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
