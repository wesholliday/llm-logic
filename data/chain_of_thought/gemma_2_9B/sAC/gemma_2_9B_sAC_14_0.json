If P, then Q (where P and Q are propositions)\n2. P is true\n\nThen we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The bear was in the cave\n* Q: The wolf was in the den\n\nWe are given:\n\n* If P, then Q (If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den) is true.\n* Q (The wolf was in the den) is true.\n\nTherefore, according to Modus Ponens, we can conclude that P (The bear was in the cave) is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
