If P, then Q (where P and Q are propositions)\n2. P is true\n\nThen we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nIn our case:\n\n1. P: The cake was chocolate\n2. Q: The muffins were blueberry\n3. We are given that Q (The muffins were blueberry) is true.\n\nTherefore, according to Modus Ponens, we can conclude that P (The cake was chocolate) must also be true. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
