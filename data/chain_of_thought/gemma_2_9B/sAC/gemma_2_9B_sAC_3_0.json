It means that if the first part (hypothesis) is true, then the second part (conclusion) must also be true.\n\n    * \"The book is a mystery novel.\" This statement tells us the conclusion of the conditional statement is true.\n\n* **The Flaw:**\n\n    While the conclusion being true *supports* the possibility that the hypothesis is also true, it doesn't *guarantee* it.  There could be other reasons why the book is a mystery novel.  \n\n    Think of it this way: If all dogs are mammals, and you see a mammal, you can't conclude that it *must* be a dog. There are other types of mammals (cats, whales, etc.).\n\n* **Counterexample:**\n\n    Imagine a scenario where:\n\n    *  \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a fantasy novel.\" (This is our new conditional statement)\n    *  \"The book is a fantasy novel.\" (The conclusion is true)\n\n    Can we conclude that the book was written by James? No! There could be other fantasy novelists.\n\nAnswer: \nno",
