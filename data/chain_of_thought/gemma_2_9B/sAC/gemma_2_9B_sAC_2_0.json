If P, then Q (where P and Q are propositions)\n2. P is true\n\nThen we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The griffin was in the forest.\n* Q: The unicorn was in the forest.\n\nWe are given:\n\n*  \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" (This is our first premise)\n* \"The unicorn was in the forest\" (This is our second premise)\n\nSince the second premise (Q) is true, and the first premise establishes a connection between P and Q, we can logically conclude that P must also be true. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
