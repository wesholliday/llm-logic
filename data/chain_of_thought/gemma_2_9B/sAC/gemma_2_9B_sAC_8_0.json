If P, then Q (where P and Q are propositions)\n2. P is true\n\nThen we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: The vampire was awake\n* Q: The mummy was awake\n\nWe are given:\n\n* If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (Premise 1)\n* The mummy was awake (Premise 2)\n\nSince both premises are true, according to Modus Ponens, we can conclude that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
