If P, then Q (where P and Q are propositions)\n2. P is true\n\nThen we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P: Sam took a plane\n* Q: Erin took a train\n\nWe are given:\n\n* If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train (Premise 1)\n* Erin took a train (Premise 2)\n\nSince Premise 2 (Erin took a train) matches Q in our Modus Ponens structure, and Premise 1 sets up the conditional relationship, we can logically conclude that P (Sam took a plane) must also be true. \n\nAnswer: yes \n",
