If P, then Q (If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter)\n2. Q is true (The robot visited Jupiter)\n\nThen we can conclude that P is also true (The alien visited Mars).\n\nIn this case, both premises are given as true. Therefore, according to the rule of Modus Ponens, we can conclude that the first premise must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
