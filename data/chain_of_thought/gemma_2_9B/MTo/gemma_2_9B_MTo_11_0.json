Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's apply this to our problem:\n\n* **P:** The cake was chocolate.\n* **Q:** The muffins were blueberry.\n\nWe are given:\n\n* **Statement 1:** The muffins were not blueberry. (This is our \"Not Q\")\n* **Statement 2:** If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. (This is our \"If P, then Q\")\n\nSince the muffins were not blueberry (Not Q), and we know that if the cake was chocolate, the muffins would have been blueberry, we can conclude that the cake was not chocolate (Not P).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
