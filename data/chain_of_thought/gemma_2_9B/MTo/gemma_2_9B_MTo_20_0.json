Modus Tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know that Q is false, then we can conclude that P is also false.\n\n1. **Identify the statements:**\n    * P: The apple was red.\n    * Q: The banana was yellow.\n\n2. **Apply Modus Tollens:**\n    * We know Q (The banana was yellow) is false because \"The banana was not yellow\" is given.\n    * Therefore, we can conclude that P (The apple was red) must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
