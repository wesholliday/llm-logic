Modus Tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know that Q is false, then we can conclude that P is also false.\n\nLet's break down the statements:\n\n* **Statement 1:** The wolf was not in the den. (This is our Q is false)\n* **Statement 2:** If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. (This is our If P, then Q statement)\n\nApplying Modus Tollens:\n\nSince the wolf was not in the den (Q is false), and we know that if the bear was in the cave (P), then the wolf would have been in the den, we can conclude that the bear was not in the cave (P is false).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
