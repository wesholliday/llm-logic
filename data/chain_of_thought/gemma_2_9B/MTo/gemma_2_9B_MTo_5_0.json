Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's apply this to our statements:\n\n* **P:** Jeff played basketball\n* **Q:** Amy played tennis\n\n* **Statement 1:** If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. (This is our \"If P, then Q\" statement)\n* **Statement 2:** Amy did not play tennis. (This is our \"Not Q\" statement)\n\nSince we know Amy did not play tennis (not Q), and we know that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy would have played tennis (If P, then Q), we can conclude that Jeff did not play basketball (not P).\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
