Modus tollens is a valid argument form that states:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's apply this to our problem:\n\n* P: Ben ate pasta\n* Q: Kate ate the salad\n\nWe are given:\n\n* Not Q: Kate did not eat the salad.\n* If P, then Q: If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\n\nSince we have the negation of Q and the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\", we can apply modus tollens to conclude that P must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
