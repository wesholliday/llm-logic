Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's apply this to our problem:\n\n* **P:** Tom watched football\n* **Q:** Jen watched basketball\n\nWe are given:\n\n* **Statement 1:** Jen did not watch basketball (Not Q)\n* **Statement 2:** If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball (If P, then Q)\n\nSince we know Jen did not watch basketball (Not Q), and we have the rule that if Tom watched football, then Jen would have watched basketball, we can conclude that Tom must not have watched football.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
