Modus tollens is a valid argument form that states:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's break down our statements:\n\n1. **P:** The griffin was in the forest.\n2. **Q:** The unicorn was in the forest.\n\n* **Statement 1:** \"The unicorn was not in the forest\" translates to \"Not Q\".\n* **Statement 2:** \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" translates to \"If P, then Q\".\n\nSince we have both \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not Q\", we can apply modus tollens to conclude \"Not P\".\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
