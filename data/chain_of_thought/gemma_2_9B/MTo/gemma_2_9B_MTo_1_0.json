Modus tollens states:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's map our premises to this structure:\n\n* P: Mary was at the wedding\n* Q: Sue was at the wedding\n\n* Premise 1: Not Q (Sue was not at the wedding)\n* Premise 2: If P, then Q (If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding)\n\nSince we have the structure of modus tollens, we can logically conclude:\n\n* Therefore, not P (Mary was not at the wedding)\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
