This is a conditional statement (if P, then Q).\n\n3. **Goal:** We want to determine if we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\n4. **Analyzing the Premises:**  Premise 1 tells us Chris didn't finish. Premise 2 tells us that if Alex *had* finished, Chris would have finished too.  \n\n5. **Logical Connection:**  Since Chris didn't finish, and Premise 2 states that Alex finishing would *guarantee* Chris finishing, we can conclude that Alex must not have finished.\n\nAnswer: yes \n",
