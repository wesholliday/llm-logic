The statement \"The envelope must have been upstairs\" only tells us its location was upstairs. It doesn't provide any information about its specific placement within the upstairs area. There could be many places upstairs where the envelope could have been, such as on a table, in a drawer, or under a bed. \n\nAnswer: no \n",
