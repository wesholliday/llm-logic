The phrase \"must have been\" indicates a strong deduction based on available evidence.\n\nThe question asks if we can infer that the meeting was either cancelled or scheduled for 2 PM.  \n\nSince the original statement already states the meeting was scheduled for 2 PM, the possibility of it being cancelled is introduced as an additional possibility. However, it's not a necessary inference.  The original statement doesn't provide any information about the meeting being cancelled.\n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
