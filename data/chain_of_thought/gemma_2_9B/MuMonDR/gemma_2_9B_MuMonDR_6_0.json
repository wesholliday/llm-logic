The phrase \"must have been\" implies a strong degree of certainty.\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"The concert must have been postponed or sold out\".  \n\nSince the original statement already confirms the concert was sold out,  we don't need to add \"postponed\" because it's not stated or implied. \n\nAnswer: \nno \n\n\n",
