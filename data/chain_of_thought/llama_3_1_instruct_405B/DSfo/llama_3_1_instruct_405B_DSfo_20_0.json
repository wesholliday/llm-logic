            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"The sunglasses aren't perched on her head\" and \"Either the sunglasses are perched on her head or they are in her bag\". The first statement directly negates the first option of the second statement, which is a classic case of a disjunctive syllogism. In a disjunctive syllogism, if one of the options of an \"either/or\" statement is proven false, then the other option must be true. Therefore, since we know the sunglasses are not perched on her head, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that they are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
