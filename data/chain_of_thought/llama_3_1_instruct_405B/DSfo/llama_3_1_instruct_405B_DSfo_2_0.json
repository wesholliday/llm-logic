            "content": "Explanation: Let's analyze the given statements step by step. The first statement, \"The book isn't resting on the table,\" directly negates the possibility of the book being on the table. The second statement, \"Either the book is resting on the table or it is on the shelf,\" presents two alternatives for the book's location. Given that the first statement eliminates the table as an option, we are left with the shelf as the only remaining possibility according to the second statement. This is a classic application of the disjunctive syllogism, a valid form of argument in logic that states if one of the options in an either-or statement is false, the other must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
