The first statement is \"The milk isn't chilling in the fridge.\" This statement directly negates the possibility of the milk being in the fridge. The second statement is \"Either the milk is chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter.\" This statement presents two mutually exclusive possibilities for the location of the milk: it is either in the fridge or on the counter. Given that the first statement eliminates the fridge as a possible location, we are left with the only other option provided by the second statement, which is that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
