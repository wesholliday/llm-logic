The second statement, \"Either the pen is on my desk or it is in my bag,\" presents two possible locations for the pen: on the desk or in the bag. Since we know from the first statement that the pen is not on the desk, we can eliminate that option from the second statement. This leaves us with the only remaining option from the second statement, which is that the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
