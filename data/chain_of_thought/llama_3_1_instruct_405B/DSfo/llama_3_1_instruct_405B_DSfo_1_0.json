            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the information given into logical statements. The first statement is \"Fido is not in the garden,\" which we can denote as ~G (where G stands for \"Fido is in the garden\" and ~ denotes negation). The second statement is \"Either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside,\" which is a disjunction and can be denoted as G \u2228 I (where I stands for \"Fido is inside\").\n\nGiven these two statements, we can apply a logical rule known as disjunctive syllogism. Disjunctive syllogism states that if we have ~A and A \u2228 B, we can infer B. In our case, ~G (Fido is not in the garden) and G \u2228 I (Either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside) match the pattern for disjunctive syllogism, where A = G and B = I.\n\nTherefore, applying disjunctive syllogism, we can infer I, which means \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
