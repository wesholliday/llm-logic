            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, let's break down the logic. The original statement is \"If the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm.\" This statement implies a direct relationship between the oven being on and the kitchen's warmth, regardless of other conditions. The second statement adds an additional condition: \"and the pilot light is out.\" However, the original statement does not specify that the pilot light's status affects the kitchen's warmth when the oven is on. It simply states that if the oven is on, the kitchen is warm, without any conditions related to the pilot light. Therefore, logically, if the oven being on is enough to make the kitchen warm according to the first statement, adding the condition about the pilot light being out does not change the fact that the oven is on, which, according to the original statement, is sufficient for the kitchen to be warm.\n\nAnswer: yes",
