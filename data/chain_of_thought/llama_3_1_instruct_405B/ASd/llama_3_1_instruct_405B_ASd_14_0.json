            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If I study hard, I will pass the test\" implies a general condition where studying hard is sufficient to pass the test. However, adding the condition \"and the test is in Chinese\" introduces a new variable that could potentially affect the outcome. The original statement does not account for the language of the test, nor does it imply that the speaker is proficient in Chinese or that studying hard would be enough to overcome any language barriers. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the new statement from the original one because the additional condition introduces uncertainty that wasn't addressed in the original premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
