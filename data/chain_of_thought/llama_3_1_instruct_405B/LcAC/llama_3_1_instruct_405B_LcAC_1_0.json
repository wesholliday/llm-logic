            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can logically conclude 'Mary was at the wedding' from the given statements, let's analyze the information step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.' This means that the presence of Mary at the wedding guarantees the presence of Sue, but it does not necessarily work the other way around. Sue could be at the wedding without Mary being there.\n\n2. The second statement is a factual statement: 'Sue was at the wedding.' This confirms that Sue was indeed at the wedding, but it does not provide direct information about Mary's presence.\n\n3. From the first statement, we know that Mary's presence would imply Sue's presence. However, from the second statement, knowing Sue was at the wedding does not allow us to conclude that Mary was there because Sue's presence does not depend solely on Mary's presence.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude 'Mary was at the wedding' based on the given statements because Sue's presence at the wedding does not necessarily imply Mary's presence.\n\nAnswer: no",
