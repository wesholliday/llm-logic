            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise states \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" which can be symbolized as M \u2192 S (where M represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S represents \"Sue was at the wedding\"). The conclusion states \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding,\" which can be symbolized as S \u2192 M.\n\nThe argument form is essentially trying to assert that from M \u2192 S, we can conclude S \u2192 M. However, this is a classic example of the fallacy of affirming the consequent or, more accurately in this context, confusing the necessary condition with the sufficient condition. Just because Sue's presence is a necessary condition for Mary's presence (as stated in the premise), it does not logically follow that Sue's presence is a sufficient condition for Mary's presence (as stated in the conclusion).\n\nIn other words, the premise only guarantees that if Mary is there, Sue will be there, but it does not guarantee that if Sue is there, Mary will necessarily be there. There could be scenarios where Sue is at the wedding, but Mary is not, which would not violate the premise but would contradict the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the form of the argument is not logically valid because it attempts to reverse the direction of the conditional statement without justification.\n\nAnswer: no",
