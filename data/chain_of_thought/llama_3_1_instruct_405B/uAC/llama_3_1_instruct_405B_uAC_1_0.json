The conditional statement only guarantees that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would also be there, but it does not guarantee the reverse. The presence of Sue does not necessarily imply the presence of Mary. The categorical statement about Sue's presence does not provide any direct information about Mary's presence. Therefore, we cannot infer that Mary was at the wedding based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
