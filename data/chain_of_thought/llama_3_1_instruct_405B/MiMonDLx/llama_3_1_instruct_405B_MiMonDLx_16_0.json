            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The zibber might be froodle or on wibble' from 'The zibber might be froodle', we need to understand the logical relationship between these two statements. The original statement suggests a possibility that the zibber is froodle. The inferred statement adds another possibility (being on wibble) in addition to being froodle. Since the original statement does not rule out other possibilities and the inferred statement includes the original possibility (being froodle), adding another option (being on wibble) does not contradict the original statement. Instead, it expands on the possibilities without negating the original assertion. Therefore, logically, if the zibber might be froodle, it also might be froodle or on wibble, as the addition of another possibility does not negate the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
