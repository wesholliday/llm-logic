            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The investment might be risky' from 'The investment might be risky and offer high returns', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statement. The original statement is a conjunction, meaning it connects two clauses with 'and'. The statement 'The investment might be risky' is one of the clauses in this conjunction. In logic, when you have a conjunction (A and B), you can infer either A or B individually from the truth of the conjunction. Therefore, if 'The investment might be risky and offer high returns' is true, then 'The investment might be risky' must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
