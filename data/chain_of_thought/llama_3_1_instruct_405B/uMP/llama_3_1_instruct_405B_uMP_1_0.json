            "content": "Explanation: This problem involves a simple logical deduction using a conditional statement and a statement of fact. The conditional statement is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be represented as \"Mary \u2192 Sue.\" We are also given the factual statement \"Mary was at the wedding,\" which can be represented simply as \"Mary.\" \n\nIn logical terms, when we have a conditional statement (if-then) and the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is true, we can conclude that the consequent (the \"then\" part) is also true. Here, \"Mary\" being at the wedding serves as the antecedent, and \"Sue\" being at the wedding is the consequent. Given that we know Mary was at the wedding, we can logically infer that Sue was also at the wedding, based on the conditional statement provided.\n\nAnswer: yes",
