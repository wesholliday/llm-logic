            "content": "Explanation: This problem involves a simple logical deduction using a conditional statement and a given fact. The conditional statement is \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This can be represented as \"Sam took a plane \u2192 Erin took a train.\" We are also given the fact that \"Sam took a plane.\" In logical deductions, when we have a conditional statement and the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is known to be true, we can conclude that the consequent (the \"then\" part) is also true. Therefore, since Sam took a plane, according to the conditional statement, we can infer that Erin took a train.\n\nAnswer: yes",
