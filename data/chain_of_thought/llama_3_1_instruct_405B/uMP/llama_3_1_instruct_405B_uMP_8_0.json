            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" and \"the vampire was awake\". The first statement sets up a conditional relationship between the vampire's state and the mummy's state. The second statement confirms that the condition (the vampire being awake) is indeed true. According to the rules of logical inference, specifically modus ponens, if we have a conditional statement \"if A then B\" and we know that A is true, we can conclude that B is also true. In this case, A is \"the vampire was awake\" and B is \"the mummy was awake\". Since we know the vampire was awake, we can infer that the mummy was awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
