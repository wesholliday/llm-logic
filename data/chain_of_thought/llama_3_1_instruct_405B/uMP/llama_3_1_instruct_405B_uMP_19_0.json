            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" and \"Tom watched football.\" The first statement is a conditional statement, where the condition is Tom watching football and the consequence is Jen watching basketball. The second statement tells us that the condition (Tom watching football) is indeed true. According to the rules of logic, if the condition of a conditional statement is true, then we can infer that the consequence is also true. Therefore, since Tom watched football, we can infer that Jen watched basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
