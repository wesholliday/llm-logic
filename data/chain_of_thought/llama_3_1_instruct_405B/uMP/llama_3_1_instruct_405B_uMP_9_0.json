            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" and \"Lisa bought the red shirt.\" The first statement sets up a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. It implies that if the condition of Lisa buying the red shirt is met, then the consequence of Mark buying the blue shirt follows. The second statement confirms that the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) has indeed been met. Therefore, based on the conditional relationship established by the first statement and the confirmation of the condition by the second statement, we can logically infer the consequence, which is that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
