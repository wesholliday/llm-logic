            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" and \"the doll was plastic.\" The first statement sets up a conditional relationship between the doll being plastic and the truck being metal. It says that if the condition of the doll being plastic is met, then it must be the case that the truck is metal. The second statement confirms that the condition is indeed met, as it states that the doll was plastic. Therefore, based on the conditional relationship established by the first statement and the confirmation provided by the second statement, we can logically infer that the truck was metal.\n\nAnswer: yes",
