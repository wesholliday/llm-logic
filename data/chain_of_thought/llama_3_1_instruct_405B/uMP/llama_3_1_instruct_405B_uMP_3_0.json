            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" and \"the book was written by James\". The first statement sets up a conditional relationship where if the condition (the book being written by James) is true, then the conclusion (the book is a mystery novel) must also be true. The second statement confirms that the condition is indeed true (the book was written by James). Therefore, based on the conditional relationship established by the first statement and the confirmation of the condition by the second statement, we can logically infer that the book is a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: yes",
