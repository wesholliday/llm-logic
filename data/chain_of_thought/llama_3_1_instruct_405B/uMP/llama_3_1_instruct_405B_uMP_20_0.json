            "content": "Explanation: This question involves a basic form of logical reasoning known as modus ponens. Modus ponens is a rule of inference that states if we have \"If P, then Q\" and we also have P, then we can conclude Q. In this scenario, \"P\" is \"the apple was red\" and \"Q\" is \"the banana was yellow.\" Given that we have both the conditional statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" and the statement \"the apple was red,\" we can apply modus ponens to infer that the banana was indeed yellow.\n\nAnswer: yes",
