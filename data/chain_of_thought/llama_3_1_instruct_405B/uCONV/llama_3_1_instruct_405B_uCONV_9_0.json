            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt, we need to examine the original statement and its implications. The original statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This statement sets up a conditional relationship where Lisa buying the red shirt is the condition (or antecedent) for Mark buying the blue shirt (the consequent). However, it does not explicitly state the reverse: that if Mark bought the blue shirt, it must be because Lisa bought the red shirt. There could be other reasons Mark bought the blue shirt that do not involve Lisa buying the red shirt. The original statement does not provide enough information to logically conclude the reverse scenario with absolute certainty. Therefore, we cannot infer the reverse condition based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
