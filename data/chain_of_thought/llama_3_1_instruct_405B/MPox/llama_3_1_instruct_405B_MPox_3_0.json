            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"The splat was morphed\" and \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\". The first statement is a simple assertion about an event or state concerning \"the splat\". The second statement is a conditional statement that connects the morphing of the splat to the quanking of the splat. In logic, when we have a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B\" and we also know that A is true, we can infer that B is true. This is known as modus ponens, a fundamental rule of inference in logic. Therefore, since we know the splat was morphed (A is true) and we have the conditional statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" (If A, then B), we can logically infer that the splat quanked (B is true).\n\nAnswer: yes",
