            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The package might arrive on Monday or Tuesday' implies that there are two possible days for the package to arrive, and it is uncertain which one it will be. The use of 'or' here is inclusive in the sense that it does not rule out the possibility of the package arriving on either day, but it does not explicitly state that both options are equally viable on their own. However, when we break it down, saying the package might arrive on Monday or Tuesday essentially means that both Monday and Tuesday are potential arrival days. Therefore, it logically follows that the package might arrive on Monday, and it also might arrive on Tuesday, when considering each day individually.\n\nAnswer: yes",
