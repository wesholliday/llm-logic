            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The concert might feature rock or jazz music' uses the word 'or', which typically indicates a choice between two options. However, in this context, 'or' is used to express uncertainty or possibility rather than a mutually exclusive choice. This is known as an inclusive 'or'. When we say 'The concert might feature rock or jazz music', we are suggesting that both rock and jazz are possibilities for the concert, not that it will definitely be one and not the other. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that 'The concert might feature rock music' and 'The concert might feature jazz music' are both true statements based on the original sentence.\n\nAnswer: yes",
