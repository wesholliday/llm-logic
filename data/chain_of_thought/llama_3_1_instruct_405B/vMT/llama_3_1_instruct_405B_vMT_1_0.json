            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument's form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Not Q\n3. Therefore, not P\n\nIn this representation, P stands for \"Mary was at the wedding,\" and Q stands for \"Sue was at the wedding.\" The argument form is known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument in logic. Modus tollens states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not Q,\" we can logically conclude \"Not P.\" This is because if Q is not true and P implies Q, then P cannot be true, as it would lead to a contradiction.\n\nGiven that the argument follows the modus tollens form, which is a recognized valid form of logical argument, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
