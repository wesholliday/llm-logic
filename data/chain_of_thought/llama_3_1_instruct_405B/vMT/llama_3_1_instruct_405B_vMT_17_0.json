            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument's form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q (If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad)\n2. Not Q (Kate did not eat salad)\n3. Therefore, Not P (Ben did not eat pasta)\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument in logic. Modus Tollens states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not Q\", we can logically conclude \"Not P\". This is because if the consequent (Q) of the conditional statement is false, and the conditional statement itself is true, then the antecedent (P) must also be false for the conditional to hold true.\n\nIn this case, if it's true that \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" and we know \"Kate did not eat salad\", then logically, \"Ben did not eat pasta\" must be true for the first statement to hold. Thus, the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, making the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
