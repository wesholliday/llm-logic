            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument's form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Not Q\n3. Therefore, not P\n\nThis form is known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument in logic. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (if P, then Q) and we know that the consequent (Q) is false, we can conclude that the antecedent (P) is also false.\n\nIn the given argument:\n\n- The first premise is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball,\" which is our \"if P, then Q.\"\n- The second premise is \"Jen did not watch basketball,\" which is our \"not Q.\"\n- The conclusion is \"Tom did not watch football,\" which is our \"not P.\"\n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens form, and modus tollens is a logically valid form of argument, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
