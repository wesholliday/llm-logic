            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument's form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q (If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel)\n2. Not Q (The book is not a mystery novel)\n3. Therefore, Not P (The book was not written by James)\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument in logic. Modus Tollens states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not Q\", we can logically conclude \"Not P\". This is because if Q is not true, and P would necessarily lead to Q, then P cannot be true.\n\nGiven that the argument follows the form of Modus Tollens, and the premises logically lead to the conclusion, the argument is considered logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
