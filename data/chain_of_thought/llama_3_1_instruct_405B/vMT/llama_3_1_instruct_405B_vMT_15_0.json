            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument's form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Not Q\n3. Therefore, not P\n\nThis form is known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument in logic. Modus tollens states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not Q\", we can logically conclude \"Not P\". This is because if Q is a necessary condition for P (as stated in the first premise), and Q is not the case (as stated in the second premise), then P cannot be the case either.\n\nIn the context of the given argument:\n\n- The first premise \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" establishes a conditional relationship where Erin taking a train is a necessary condition for Sam taking a plane.\n- The second premise \"Erin did not take a train\" negates the condition established in the first premise.\n- Therefore, according to modus tollens, we can logically conclude that \"Sam did not take a plane\".\n\nSince the argument follows a logically valid form, it is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
