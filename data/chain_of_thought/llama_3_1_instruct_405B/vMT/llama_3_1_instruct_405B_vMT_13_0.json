            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument is structured as follows:\n\n1. If the car was red, then the truck was blue. (If P, then Q)\n2. The truck was not blue. (Not Q)\n3. Therefore, the car was not red. (Therefore, not P)\n\nThis argument form is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument in logic. Modus Tollens states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not Q\", we can logically conclude \"Not P\". This is because if the condition (P) were true, then the consequence (Q) would also be true according to the first premise. However, since we know the consequence (Q) is not true from the second premise, we can infer that the condition (P) must not be true.\n\nTherefore, given the premises that if the car was red, then the truck was blue, and the truck was not blue, we can logically conclude that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
