            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument's form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q (If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den)\n2. Not Q (The wolf was not in the den)\n3. Therefore, Not P (The bear was not in the cave)\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument in logic. Modus Tollens states that if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must also be false. In this case, if the presence of the bear in the cave implies the presence of the wolf in the den, and we know the wolf is not in the den, then we can logically conclude that the bear is not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes",
