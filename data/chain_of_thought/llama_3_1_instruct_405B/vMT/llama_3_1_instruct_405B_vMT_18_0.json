            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument is structured as follows:\n\n1. If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. (If P, then Q)\n2. The truck was not metal. (Not Q)\n3. Therefore, the doll was not plastic. (Therefore, not P)\n\nThis argument form is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument in logic. Modus Tollens states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not Q,\" we can logically conclude \"Not P.\" This is because if the condition (P) leads to a consequence (Q) that we know is false, we can infer that the condition (P) must also be false, given the relationship between P and Q established by the first premise.\n\nGiven that the argument follows the form of Modus Tollens, and Modus Tollens is a logically valid form of argument, the conclusion of the argument logically follows from its premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
