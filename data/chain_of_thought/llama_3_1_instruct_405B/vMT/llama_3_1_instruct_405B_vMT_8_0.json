            "content": "Explanation: To determine the logical validity of the argument, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument is structured as follows:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. (If P, then Q)\n2. The mummy was not awake. (Not Q)\n3. Therefore, the vampire was not awake. (Therefore, not P)\n\nThis argument form is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument in logic. Modus Tollens states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not Q,\" we can logically conclude \"Not P.\" The structure of the argument matches this form exactly, with P representing \"the vampire was awake\" and Q representing \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\nGiven the premises, the conclusion logically follows because if the mummy's wakefulness is a necessary condition for the vampire's wakefulness (as stated in the first premise), and we know the mummy was not awake (as stated in the second premise), then it logically follows that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
