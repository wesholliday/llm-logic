            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument is structured as follows:\n\n1. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. (If A, then B)\n2. The pants were not denim. (Not B)\n3. Therefore, the shirt was not cotton. (Therefore, not A)\n\nThis argument form is known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument in logic. Modus tollens states that if we have \"If A, then B\" and \"Not B,\" we can logically conclude \"Not A.\" This is because if B is a necessary condition for A (as stated in the first premise), and B is not the case (as stated in the second premise), then A cannot be the case either.\n\nGiven that the argument follows the modus tollens form, which is a logically valid form, the conclusion of the argument logically follows from its premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
