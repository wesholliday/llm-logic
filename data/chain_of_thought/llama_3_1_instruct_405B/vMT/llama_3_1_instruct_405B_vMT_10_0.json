            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument can be represented in a symbolic form as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q (If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside)\n2. Not Q (The cat was not outside)\n3. Therefore, Not P (The dog was not inside)\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument in logic. Modus Tollens states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not Q\", we can logically conclude \"Not P\". This is because if Q is a necessary condition for P (as stated in the first premise), and Q is not the case (as stated in the second premise), then P cannot be the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
