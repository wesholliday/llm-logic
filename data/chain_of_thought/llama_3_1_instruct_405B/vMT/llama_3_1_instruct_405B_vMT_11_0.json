            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument is structured as follows:\n\n1. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n2. The muffins were not blueberry.\n3. Therefore, the cake was not chocolate.\n\nThis argument form is known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument in logic. Modus tollens has the general form:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn our case, P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins were blueberry\". Given that the premises match this form and the conclusion logically follows from these premises according to the rules of modus tollens, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
