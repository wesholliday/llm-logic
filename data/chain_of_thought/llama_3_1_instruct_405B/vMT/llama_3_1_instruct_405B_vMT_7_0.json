            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument's form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q (If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race)\n2. Not Q (Chris did not finish the race)\n3. Therefore, Not P (Alex did not finish the race)\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument in logic. Modus Tollens states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not Q\", we can logically conclude \"Not P\". This is because if Q is a necessary condition for P (as stated in the first premise), and Q is not the case (as stated in the second premise), then P cannot be the case either.\n\nTherefore, given the premises, the conclusion logically follows, making the argument form logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
