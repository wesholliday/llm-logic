            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument's form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q (If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt)\n2. Not Q (Mark did not buy the blue shirt)\n3. Therefore, Not P (Lisa did not buy the red shirt)\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument in logic. Modus Tollens states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not Q\", we can logically conclude \"Not P\". This is because if the consequent (Q) of the conditional statement is false, and the conditional statement itself is true, then the antecedent (P) must also be false for the conditional to hold true.\n\nTherefore, given the premises that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt, and Mark did not buy the blue shirt, we can logically conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
