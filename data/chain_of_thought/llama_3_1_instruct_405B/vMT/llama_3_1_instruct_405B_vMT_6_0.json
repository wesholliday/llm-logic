            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument is structured as follows:\n\n1. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. (If P, then Q)\n2. Bob did not choose pasta. (Not Q)\n3. Therefore, Sue did not choose pizza. (Therefore, Not P)\n\nThis argument form is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument in logic. Modus Tollens states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not Q,\" we can logically conclude \"Not P.\" This is because if the consequent (Q) is false, and the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is true, it must be the case that the antecedent (P) is also false, as the truth of P would necessitate the truth of Q, which contradicts the given \"Not Q.\"\n\nGiven that the argument follows the form of Modus Tollens, and considering the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
