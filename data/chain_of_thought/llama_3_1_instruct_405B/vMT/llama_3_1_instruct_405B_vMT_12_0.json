            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument's form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Not Q\n3. Therefore, not P\n\nThis form is known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument in logic. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (if P, then Q) and we know that the consequent (Q) is false, we can conclude that the antecedent (P) is also false.\n\nIn the given argument:\n\n- The first premise is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo,\" which is our \"If P, then Q.\"\n- The second premise is \"Lucy did not go to the zoo,\" which is our \"Not Q.\"\n- The conclusion is \"Joe did not go to the park,\" which is our \"Therefore, not P.\"\n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens form, which is a logically valid form, the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
