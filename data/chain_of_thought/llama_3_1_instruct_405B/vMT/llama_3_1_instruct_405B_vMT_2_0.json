            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument's form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Not Q\n3. Therefore, not P\n\nThis form is known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument in logic. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (if P, then Q) and we know that the consequent (Q) is false, we can conclude that the antecedent (P) is also false.\n\nIn the given argument:\n- P represents \"the griffin was in the forest\"\n- Q represents \"the unicorn was in the forest\"\n\nGiven the premises that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest, and the unicorn was not in the forest, we can logically conclude that the griffin was not in the forest because the absence of the unicorn (not Q) implies the absence of the condition that would have led to the unicorn's presence (not P), according to the conditional statement provided.\n\nTherefore, the argument follows a logically valid form.\n\nAnswer: yes",
