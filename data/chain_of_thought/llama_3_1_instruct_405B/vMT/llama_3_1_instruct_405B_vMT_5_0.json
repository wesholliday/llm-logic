            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument's form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Not Q\n3. Therefore, not P\n\nThis form is known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument in logic. The reasoning is that if P implies Q, and Q is not the case, then P cannot be the case either, because if P were true, Q would have to be true as well, according to the first premise. Since Q is not true, as stated by the second premise, the only logical conclusion is that P is not true.\n\nIn the context of the given argument:\n- P represents \"Jeff played basketball\"\n- Q represents \"Amy played tennis\"\n\nGiven that the argument follows the modus tollens form, which is a logically valid form, the conclusion \"Jeff did not play basketball\" necessarily follows from the premises \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" and \"Amy did not play tennis\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
