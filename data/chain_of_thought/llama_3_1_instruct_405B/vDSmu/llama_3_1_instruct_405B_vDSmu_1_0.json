            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument can be represented in a symbolic form as follows:\n\n1. P \u2228 Q (Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden)\n2. \u00acQ (It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden)\n3. \u2234 P (Fido is inside)\n\nWhere P represents \"Fido is inside\" and Q represents \"Fido must be in the garden\".\n\nThe argument form is a classic example of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. The disjunctive syllogism form is:\n\n1. P \u2228 Q\n2. \u00acQ\n3. \u2234 P\n\nThis form is considered valid because if one of the disjuncts (P or Q) is eliminated (by stating \u00acQ), the other disjunct (P) must be true in order for the disjunction (P \u2228 Q) to be true. Since the premises logically lead to the conclusion without any errors in form, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
