            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statement into a logical form. The original statement is \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\" This can be represented as \"M \u2192 Q,\" where M stands for \"the splat was morphed\" and Q stands for \"the splat quanked.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed\" from the original statement. This inference can be represented as \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acM,\" where \u00ac denotes negation.\n\nIn logic, the original statement \"M \u2192 Q\" is equivalent to \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acM\" by the rule of contrapositive inference. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, from \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked,\" we can logically infer \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
