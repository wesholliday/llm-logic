            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked' from 'If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged', we need to examine the logical structure of the statements. The original statement is in the form of 'If A, then B', which implies that A is a sufficient condition for B. The statement we are trying to infer is in the form of 'If not B, then not A', which is the contrapositive of the original statement. In classical logic, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if 'If A, then B' is true, then 'If not B, then not A' is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
