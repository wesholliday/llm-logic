            "content": "Explanation: To answer this question, we need to apply the rules of logical inference, specifically focusing on the conditional statement given and its contrapositive. The original statement is \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the wug was sproinged\" and Q is \"it was garpled.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nApplying this to our original statement, we find its contrapositive by negating both the condition and the consequence and then swapping them. Thus, the contrapositive of \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" is \"If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged.\"\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer \"If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged\" from \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
