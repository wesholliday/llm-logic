            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statement into a logical form. The original statement is \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\" We can represent this as \"V \u2192 S,\" where \"V\" stands for \"the dreb was vroombed\" and \"S\" stands for \"the dreb was spened.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\" from the original statement. This can be represented as \"\u00acS \u2192 \u00acV,\" where \"\u00ac\" denotes negation.\n\nIn logic, the original statement \"V \u2192 S\" is equivalent to its contrapositive, which is \"\u00acS \u2192 \u00acV.\" This is a fundamental property of conditional statements in logic. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning they have the same truth value in all possible worlds.\n\nTherefore, from \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened,\" we can logically infer \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
