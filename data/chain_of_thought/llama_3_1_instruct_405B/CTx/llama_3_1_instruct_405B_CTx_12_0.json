            "content": "Explanation: To answer this question, we need to examine the original statement and the proposed inference. The original statement is \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the smip was shripped\" and B is \"the smip lupped the zoint.\" \n\nThe proposed inference is \"If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped.\" This is the contrapositive of the original statement, which is of the form \"If not B, then not A.\" \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa. The contrapositive is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion of the original statement and then switching them.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
