            "content": "Explanation: To answer this question, we need to examine the original statement and its logical implications. The original statement is \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\" This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the grommet was sploffed\" and B is \"the grommet plopped the frink.\" \n\nIn logic, when we have a statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" we can infer its contrapositive, which is \"If not B, then not A.\" The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning they have the same truth conditions. \n\nApplying this to the given statement, the contrapositive would be \"If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\" This follows the exact form of the contrapositive of the original statement, where we negate both the condition and the consequence and swap their positions.\n\nAnswer: yes",
