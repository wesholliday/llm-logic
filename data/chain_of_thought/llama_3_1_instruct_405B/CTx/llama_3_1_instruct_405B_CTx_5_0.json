            "content": "Explanation: To approach this question, we need to understand the logical relationship between the given statement and the statement we are trying to infer. The original statement is \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the zinger was fraggled\" and B is \"the zinger was smoogled.\"\n\nThe statement we are trying to infer is \"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled.\" This is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nIn classical logic, a conditional statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive. This means that if \"If A, then B\" is true, then \"If not B, then not A\" is also true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, from the original statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled,\" we can logically infer its contrapositive, \"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
