            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked' from 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled', we need to examine the logical structure of these statements. The original statement is in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the sprocket was cranked' and Q is 'the sprocket was daggled'. The statement we are trying to infer is in the form of 'If not Q, then not P'. This is a classic case of the contrapositive in logic. The contrapositive of a statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P', and it is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa. Therefore, we can logically infer 'If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked' from 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
