            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statement into a logical form. The original statement is \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\" We can represent this as \"If A, then B\" or in logical notation as A \u2192 B, where A represents \"the whiffle was shanked\" and B represents \"the whiffle tinked.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked\" from the original statement. This can be represented as \"If not B, then not A\" or in logical notation as \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA.\n\nIn logic, the original statement \"If A, then B\" (A \u2192 B) is logically equivalent to \"If not B, then not A\" (\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA). This equivalence is known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, from \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked,\" we can indeed infer \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
