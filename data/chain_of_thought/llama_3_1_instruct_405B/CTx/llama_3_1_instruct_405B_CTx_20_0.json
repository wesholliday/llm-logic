            "content": "Explanation: To answer this question, we need to apply the rules of logical inference, specifically focusing on the conditional statement given: \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\" This statement is in the form of \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the fleeg was bluttered\" and Q is \"it surned.\" The question asks us to infer the contrapositive of this statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P,\" or in the context of the given statement, \"If the fleeg did not surn, then the fleeg was not bluttered.\"\n\nIn classical logic, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if \"If P, then Q\" is true, then \"If not Q, then not P\" is also true. Therefore, from the given statement \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned,\" we can logically infer its contrapositive, \"If the fleeg did not surn, then the fleeg was not bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
