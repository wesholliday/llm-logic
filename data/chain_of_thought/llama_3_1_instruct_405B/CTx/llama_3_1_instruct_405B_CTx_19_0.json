            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statement into a logical form. The original statement is \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\" We can represent this as \"V \u2192 P,\" where V stands for \"the smonk was vreebled\" and P stands for \"the smonk plagged.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If the smonk did not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled\" from the original statement. This can be represented as \"\u00acP \u2192 \u00acV,\" where \u00acP means \"the smonk did not plagged\" and \u00acV means \"the smonk was not vreebled.\"\n\nIn logic, the form \"V \u2192 P\" is equivalent to \"\u00acP \u2192 \u00acV\" through the principle of contrapositive inference. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, from \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged,\" we can logically infer \"If the smonk did not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
