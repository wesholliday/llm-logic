            "content": "Explanation: To answer this question, we need to examine the logical structure of the given statement and the proposed inference. The original statement is in the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the wug was flooped\" and B is \"the wug bimmed the zoint.\" The proposed inference is in the form \"If not B, then not A,\" which is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nIn classical logic, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if \"If A, then B\" is true, then \"If not B, then not A\" is also true. The contrapositive is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion of the original statement and then switching their positions.\n\nGiven this logical principle, we can directly infer the contrapositive of the given statement. Therefore, from \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint,\" we can indeed infer \"If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
