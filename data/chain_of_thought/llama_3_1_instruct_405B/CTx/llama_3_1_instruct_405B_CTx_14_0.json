            "content": "Explanation: To approach this question, we need to understand the basic principles of logical inference, particularly focusing on the rules of conditional statements. The given statement is in the form \"If P, then Q\" (If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged), where P represents \"the clug was fleeked\" and Q represents \"the clug snugged\".\n\nIn logic, the statement \"If P, then Q\" is equivalent to its contrapositive, which is \"If not Q, then not P\". This is a fundamental rule of inference. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning they have the same truth value in all possible worlds.\n\nApplying this rule to the given statement, we can infer its contrapositive as follows: \"If the clug did not snuggle, then the clug was not fleeked\". This is a direct application of the contrapositive rule, where we negate both the consequent (Q) and the antecedent (P) and swap their positions.\n\nTherefore, from the original statement \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\", we can logically infer \"If the clug did not snuggle, then the clug was not fleeked\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
