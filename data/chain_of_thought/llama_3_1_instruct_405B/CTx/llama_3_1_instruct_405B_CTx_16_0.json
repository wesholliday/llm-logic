            "content": "Explanation: To approach this question, we need to analyze the given statement and the inferred statement using logical reasoning. The original statement is \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\" This can be represented in a conditional form as \"If A, then B\" where A is \"the sneg was crampled\" and B is \"the sneg sproted the frink.\" \n\nIn logic, the form \"If A, then B\" is equivalent to \"If not B, then not A.\" This is known as the contrapositive form. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning they have the same truth value in all cases.\n\nThe inferred statement \"If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled\" is the contrapositive of the original statement. Therefore, we can logically infer this statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
