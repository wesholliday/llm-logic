            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statement into a logical form. The original statement is \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\" This can be represented as \"P \u2192 V,\" where P stands for \"the twonk was plinked\" and V stands for \"the twonk was varnished.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked\" from the original statement. This new statement can be represented as \"\u00acV \u2192 \u00acP,\" where \u00acV means \"the twonk was not varnished\" and \u00acP means \"the twonk was not plinked.\"\n\nIn logic, the form \"P \u2192 V\" implies \"\u00acV \u2192 \u00acP\" is known as the contrapositive, which is a valid form of argument. This means if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, from \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished,\" we can logically infer \"If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
