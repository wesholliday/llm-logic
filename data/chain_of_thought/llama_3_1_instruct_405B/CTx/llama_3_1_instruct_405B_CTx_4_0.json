            "content": "Explanation: To answer this question, we need to apply the rules of logical inference, specifically focusing on the relationship between the given statement and the statement we are trying to infer. The original statement is \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\" This is in the form of \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the fribble was snurgled\" and B is \"the fribble crinked.\"\n\nThe statement we are trying to infer is \"If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled.\" This is in the form of \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nIn logic, the rule that allows us to infer \"If not B, then not A\" from \"If A, then B\" is called contrapositive inference. The contrapositive of a statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A,\" and it is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, from \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked,\" we can logically infer \"If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
