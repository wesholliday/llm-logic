There is no logical connection or implication that allows us to infer the additional statement 'flimble a zibble' from the original statement. The original statement is a declaration about the zizz, and adding 'flimble a zibble' introduces new, unrelated information that cannot be logically deduced from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
