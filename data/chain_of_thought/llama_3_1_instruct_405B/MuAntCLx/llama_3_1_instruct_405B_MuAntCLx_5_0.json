The original statement only asserts that the gronk must have the property of being 'quazzle wump'. It does not provide any information about the property of being 'blimple for'. Since the second statement adds an additional property ('blimple for') not present in the original statement, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first without additional information.\n\nAnswer: no",
