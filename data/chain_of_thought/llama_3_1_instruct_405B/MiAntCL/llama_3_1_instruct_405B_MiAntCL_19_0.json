            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The application might be completed online' only provides information about the method of completing the application, which is online. It does not provide any information about the content or requirements of the application, such as whether references are included. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that the application includes references based on the given statement. However, it also does not rule out the possibility of references being included. Since \"might\" already implies uncertainty, adding another component like \"include references\" doesn't contradict the original statement but rather expands on a possibility without negating the original condition.\n\nAnswer: yes",
