However, it does not rule out the possibility of subtitles either. Since the original statement is about a possibility (indicated by 'might'), we can infer that if the movie might be in English, then it also might be the case that it has subtitles, as having subtitles does not contradict the movie being in English.\n\nAnswer: yes",
