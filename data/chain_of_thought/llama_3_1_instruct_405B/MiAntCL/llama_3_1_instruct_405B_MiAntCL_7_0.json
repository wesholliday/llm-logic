It does not provide any information about the scope or content of the exam, such as which chapters it might cover. To infer that the exam might cover all chapters, we would need additional information that is not present in the original statement. The original statement only addresses the difficulty, not the scope, so we cannot logically infer the specific details about the content or scope of the exam.\n\nAnswer: no",
