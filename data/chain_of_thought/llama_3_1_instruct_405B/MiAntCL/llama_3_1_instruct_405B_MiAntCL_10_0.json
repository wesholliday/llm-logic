            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The document might be signed and notarized' from 'The document might be signed', we need to consider the relationship between signing and notarizing a document. Signing a document is a prerequisite for notarizing it, as notarization typically involves verifying the authenticity of a signature. However, not all signed documents are notarized. The original statement only mentions the possibility of the document being signed, without providing any information about notarization. Therefore, while it's conceivable that a signed document could also be notarized, the original statement does not inherently imply that notarization is a possibility.\n\nAnswer: no",
