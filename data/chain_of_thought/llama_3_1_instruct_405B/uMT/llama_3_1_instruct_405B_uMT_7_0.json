The first statement is \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This is a conditional statement where the condition is Alex finishing the race, and the consequence is Chris finishing the race. The second statement is \"Chris did not finish the race.\" Given this information, we can use the process of elimination to infer about Alex's status.\n\nSince the first statement ties Alex's completion of the race to Chris's completion, and we know Chris did not finish, we can infer that if Alex had finished, Chris would have finished as well, according to the first statement. However, since Chris did not finish, it implies that the condition (Alex finishing the race) that would have led to Chris finishing the race was not met.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical deduction, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race because if Alex had finished, Chris would have finished, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
