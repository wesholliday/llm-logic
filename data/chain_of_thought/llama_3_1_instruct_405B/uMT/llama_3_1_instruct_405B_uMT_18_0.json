            "content": "Explanation: Let's analyze the given statements step by step. The first statement is \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This is a conditional statement that connects the material of the doll to the material of the truck. It implies that if the doll is made of plastic, then the truck must be made of metal. The second statement is \"the truck was not metal.\" This statement directly contradicts the consequence of the first statement, which would require the truck to be metal if the doll was plastic. Since the truck is not metal, it means the condition that leads to the truck being metal (the doll being plastic) cannot be true. Therefore, we can infer that the doll was not plastic because if it were, the truck would have to be metal, which contradicts the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
