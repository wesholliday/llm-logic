            "content": "Explanation: Let's analyze the given statements step by step. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\" This means that the presence of the bear in the cave implies the presence of the wolf in the den. The second statement is a factual statement: \"The wolf was not in the den.\" Given that the wolf was not in the den, we can infer that the condition for the wolf being in the den was not met. Since the condition for the wolf being in the den is that the bear must be in the cave, and we know the wolf was not in the den, it logically follows that the bear was not in the cave. This is because if the bear were in the cave, according to the first statement, the wolf would have to be in the den, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
