            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the information given. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This means that the wakefulness of the vampire implies the wakefulness of the mummy. However, it does not imply the reverse; the mummy being awake does not necessarily mean the vampire is awake. The second statement is a direct assertion: \"the mummy was not awake.\" Given this, we can use the first statement to infer something about the vampire's state. Since the mummy's wakefulness is a necessary condition for the vampire's wakefulness (based on the first statement), and we know the mummy was not awake, we can logically conclude that the vampire could not have been awake. This is because if the vampire were awake, the mummy would have to be awake as well, which contradicts the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
