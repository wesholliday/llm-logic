The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This means that if James is the author, the book must be a mystery novel. The second statement is a direct assertion: \"the book is not a mystery novel.\" Given that the book is not a mystery novel, and knowing that if James wrote it, it would have to be a mystery novel, we can logically conclude that James did not write the book. This is because if he had, the book would be a mystery novel, which contradicts the given fact that it is not.\n\nAnswer: yes",
