            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This means that if the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the consequence (the banana being yellow) must also be true. However, it does not guarantee the reverse; the banana being yellow does not necessarily mean the apple was red, and the apple not being red does not necessarily mean the banana was not yellow. The second statement is a factual statement: \"The banana was not yellow.\" Given this, we can use the information to infer about the color of the apple. Since the banana was not yellow, and the condition for the banana to be yellow (according to the first statement) is that the apple must be red, we can infer that the condition (the apple being red) was not met. This is because if the condition had been met (apple being red), the consequence (banana being yellow) would have been true, which contradicts the factual statement that the banana was not yellow.\n\nAnswer: yes",
