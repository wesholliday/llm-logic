            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the information given step by step. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This means that if the condition (Tom watching football) is true, then the consequence (Jen watching basketball) must also be true. The second statement is a factual statement: \"Jen did not watch basketball.\" Given that Jen did not watch basketball, we can infer about the condition that leads to Jen watching basketball. Since Jen watching basketball is the consequence of Tom watching football, and we know Jen did not watch basketball, it implies that the condition (Tom watching football) did not occur. This is because if Tom had watched football, then according to the first statement, Jen would have watched basketball, which contradicts the second statement. Therefore, we can logically infer that Tom did not watch football because if he had, it would lead to a contradiction with the known fact that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
