            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into logical premises and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. The first premise is \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This is a conditional statement that can be represented as \"Jeff played basketball \u2192 Amy played tennis.\"\n\n2. The second premise is \"Amy did not play tennis.\" This is a straightforward statement that negates the consequent of the first premise.\n\nGiven these premises, we can apply a logical rule known as modus tollens, which states that if we have \"A \u2192 B\" and \"not B,\" we can conclude \"not A.\"\n\nApplying modus tollens to our premises:\n- \"Jeff played basketball \u2192 Amy played tennis\" (If A, then B)\n- \"Amy did not play tennis\" (not B)\n\nTherefore, we can logically conclude \"Jeff did not play basketball\" (not A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
