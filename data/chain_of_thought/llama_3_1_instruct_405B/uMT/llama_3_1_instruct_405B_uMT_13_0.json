The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This means that if the condition (the car being red) is true, then the consequence (the truck being blue) must also be true. However, it does not assert that the condition is actually true, only what would happen if it were true. The second statement is a factual assertion: \"the truck was not blue.\" Given this, we can reason about the first statement. If the truck was not blue, and the conditional statement is that if the car was red then the truck would be blue, we can infer that the condition (the car being red) must not have been true. This is because if the car were red, according to the conditional statement, the truck would have to be blue, which contradicts the factual assertion that the truck was not blue.\n\nAnswer: yes",
