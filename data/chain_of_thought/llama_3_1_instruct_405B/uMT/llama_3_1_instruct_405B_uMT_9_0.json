            "content": "Explanation: Let's analyze the given statements step by step. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This means that if the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the consequence (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true. The second statement is a factual statement: \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\" This statement directly negates the consequence of the first statement. Since the consequence (Mark buying the blue shirt) is false, we can infer that the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) must also be false. This is because if Lisa had bought the red shirt, Mark would have bought the blue shirt, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
