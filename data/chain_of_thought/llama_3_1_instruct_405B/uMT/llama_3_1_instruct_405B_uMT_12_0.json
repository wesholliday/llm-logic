            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to apply the rules of logical deduction. We are given two statements: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" and \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\" The first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"Joe went to the park\" and B is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" The second statement negates B, saying \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\" Using the rule of contrapositive inference, which states that if we know \"If A, then B\" and we also know \"not B,\" we can infer \"not A.\" Applying this rule to our statements, since we know Lucy did not go to the zoo (not B), we can infer that Joe did not go to the park (not A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
