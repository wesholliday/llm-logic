            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we can use a logical approach based on the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be represented as \"Mary \u2192 Sue.\" The second statement is a factual statement: \"Sue was not at the wedding,\" which can be represented as \"\u00acSue\" (not Sue). \n\nGiven the conditional statement, the only way we can be certain that Sue was not at the wedding (\u00acSue) is if the condition that would have led to her being there (Mary being at the wedding) did not occur. This is because if Mary being at the wedding (Mary) would necessarily result in Sue being at the wedding (Sue), and we know Sue was not at the wedding (\u00acSue), then the initial condition (Mary being at the wedding) must not have been met.\n\nTherefore, using the information provided and logical deduction, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding because if she had been, Sue would have been there as well, which contradicts the given fact that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
