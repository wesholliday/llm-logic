There is no third option.\n\n2. \"The splat might not be quanked\" - This statement introduces uncertainty about the quanking of the splat, suggesting that it is possible for the splat not to be quanked.\n\nGiven these two statements, if the splat might not be quanked, then according to the first statement, the only other possibility is that it is morphed. The uncertainty about quanking does not negate the morphing possibility; rather, it supports the idea that if the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed, based on the binary choice presented.\n\nTherefore, from the information provided, we can infer that if there's a possibility the splat is not quanked, given the only two options are quanked or morphed, then it must be morphed if it's not quanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
