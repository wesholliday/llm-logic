The original statement is \"The application might be completed online or in person.\" This statement presents two alternatives for completing the application: online or in person. The use of \"or\" indicates that both options are possible. Therefore, it logically follows that if the application might be completed online or in person, then it indeed might be completed in person, as that is one of the explicitly mentioned options.\n\nAnswer: yes",
