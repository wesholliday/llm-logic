The original statement presents two possibilities connected by 'or', which indicates that at least one of the options is a possibility. The statement explicitly mentions that the project might be completed by Friday or it might be extended. Since 'extended' is presented as one of the options, it directly implies that there is a possibility of the project being extended.\n\nAnswer: yes",
