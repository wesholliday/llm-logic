            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The package might be delivered today or tomorrow' implies that there are two possible days for the delivery: today and tomorrow. It indicates that the speaker is uncertain about the exact day of delivery but acknowledges that both days are potential options. The statement we are trying to infer, 'The package might be delivered tomorrow', focuses on just one of those options. Since the original statement already includes tomorrow as a possible delivery day, it logically follows that the package indeed might be delivered tomorrow. This inference does not contradict the original statement but rather isolates one of the possibilities mentioned.\n\nAnswer: yes",
