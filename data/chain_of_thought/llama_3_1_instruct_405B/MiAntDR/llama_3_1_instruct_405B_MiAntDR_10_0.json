            "content": "Explanation: To answer this question, we need to analyze the given statement and the statement we are trying to infer. The original statement is \"The document might be signed or notarized.\" This statement implies that there are two possibilities for the document: it could be signed, or it could be notarized. The use of \"or\" indicates that at least one of these conditions might be true. \n\nNow, looking at the statement we are trying to infer, \"The document might be notarized,\" this statement is directly included in the original statement as one of the possibilities. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then it logically follows that \"The document might be notarized\" could also be true, as it is a part of the original condition.\n\nAnswer: yes",
