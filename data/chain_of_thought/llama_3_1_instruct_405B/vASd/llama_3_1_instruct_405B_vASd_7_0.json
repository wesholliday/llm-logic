            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. The premise is given as \"If the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm,\" which we can represent symbolically as \"O \u2192 W\" (where O represents \"the oven is on\" and W represents \"the kitchen is warm\"). The conclusion is \"If the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm,\" which can be represented as \"(O \u2227 P) \u2192 W\" (where P represents \"the pilot light is out\").\n\nThe argument's form is essentially asking whether adding an additional condition (the pilot light being out) to the premise affects the original implication (if the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm). The key to logical validity in this case is understanding that the original premise does not specify anything about the pilot light's status. It simply states that if the oven is on, the kitchen is warm, regardless of any other conditions.\n\nTherefore, adding the condition about the pilot light being out does not change the original implication. If the oven being on is sufficient to make the kitchen warm, then the status of the pilot light does not affect this outcome according to the premise provided. This means the conclusion logically follows from the premise, as the premise's condition (oven is on) still leads to the conclusion (kitchen is warm) regardless of the pilot light's status.\n\nAnswer: yes",
