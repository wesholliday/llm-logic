            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statement into a logical form. The original statement is \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it did not surn.\" We can represent this as \"If B, then not S\" where B stands for \"the fleeg was bluttered\" and S stands for \"the fleeg surned.\"\n\nIn logical terms, this is represented as B \u2192 \u00acS (where \u00ac denotes \"not\").\n\nWe are asked to infer \"If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered,\" which can be represented as \"If S, then not B\" or logically as S \u2192 \u00acB.\n\nThe original statement implies that being bluttered prevents surning, but it does not directly state what happens if the fleeg surns. However, logically, if being bluttered means the fleeg cannot surn, then if the fleeg does surn, it could not have been bluttered. This is a contrapositive form of the original statement, which in logic is considered equivalent.\n\nThe contrapositive of B \u2192 \u00acS is indeed S \u2192 \u00acB, meaning that if the fleeg surned, then it was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
