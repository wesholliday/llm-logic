            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, let's analyze the given statement logically. The original statement is \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was not nugged.\" This can be represented in a conditional form as \"P \u2192 \u00acN\", where P represents \"the shank was plooked\" and N represents \"the shank was nugged\". The \u00ac symbol denotes negation, meaning \"not\".\n\nIn logic, the given statement is a conditional statement that only directly tells us something about the situation when the shank is plooked. However, we are asked to infer the truth of the converse situation, \"If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked,\" which can be represented as \"N \u2192 \u00acP\".\n\nThe original statement does not directly provide information about what happens when the shank is nugged; it only tells us that if the shank is plooked, it cannot be nugged. However, in logic, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"P \u2192 \u00acN\" is \"N \u2192 \u00acP\", which is exactly what we are trying to infer.\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer \"If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked\" from \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was not nugged\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
