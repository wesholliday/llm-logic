            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statement into a logical form. The original statement is \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg did not sproted the frink.\" Let's denote \"the sneg was crampled\" as C, and \"the sneg sproted the frink\" as S. The original statement in logical form is then: C \u2192 \u00acS (where \u00ac denotes \"not\").\n\nWe are asked if we can infer \"If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled,\" which in logical form is S \u2192 \u00acC.\n\nThe original statement implies that if C is true, then S must be false. The inferred statement suggests that if S is true, then C must be false. This is a classic case of the contrapositive in logic, which states that a conditional statement (C \u2192 \u00acS) is logically equivalent to its contrapositive (S \u2192 \u00acC).\n\nTherefore, the inferred statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning we can indeed infer it.\n\nAnswer: yes",
