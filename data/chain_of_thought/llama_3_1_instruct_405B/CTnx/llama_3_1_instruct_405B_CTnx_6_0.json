            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statement into a logical form. Let's denote \"the grommet was sploffed\" as S, \"the grommet did plop the frink\" as P. The original statement is \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink,\" which translates to \"If S, then not P.\" In logical notation, this is S \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nWe are asked if we can infer \"If the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed,\" which translates to \"If P, then not S,\" or P \u2192 \u00acS.\n\nThe original statement implies that being sploffed (S) prevents the grommet from plopping the frink (P). The inference in question essentially asks if plopping the frink (P) means the grommet wasn't sploffed (\u00acS). This is a matter of logical contrapositive. The contrapositive of S \u2192 \u00acP is indeed P \u2192 \u00acS, because if P being true means S cannot be true (to maintain the truth of the original statement), then S being true would mean P cannot be true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, logically, if the grommet plopping the frink means it cannot have been sploffed (to maintain consistency with the original statement), we can indeed infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
