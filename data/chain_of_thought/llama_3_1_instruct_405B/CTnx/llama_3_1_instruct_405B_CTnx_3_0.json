            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statement and the statement we're trying to infer into logical notation. Let's denote \"the splat was morphed\" as M and \"the splat did quank\" as Q.\n\nThe given statement is: If the splat was morphed, then the splat did not quank. In logical notation, this is M \u2192 \u00acQ.\n\nThe statement we're trying to infer is: If the splat quanked, then the splat was not morphed. In logical notation, this is Q \u2192 \u00acM.\n\nTo see if we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to understand the relationship between these two logical expressions. The given statement, M \u2192 \u00acQ, can be logically equivalent to its contrapositive, which is formed by negating both sides of the implication and then swapping them. The contrapositive of M \u2192 \u00acQ is \u00ac(\u00acQ) \u2192 \u00acM, which simplifies to Q \u2192 \u00acM.\n\nSince the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer Q \u2192 \u00acM from M \u2192 \u00acQ.\n\nAnswer: yes",
