            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statement into a logical form. The original statement is \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint.\" We can represent this as \"F \u2192 \u00acB\", where F stands for \"the wug was flooped\" and B stands for \"the wug bimmed the zoint\". The statement we are trying to infer is \"If the wug bimmed the zoint, then the wug was not flooped,\" which can be represented as \"B \u2192 \u00acF\".\n\nIn logic, the original statement \"F \u2192 \u00acB\" is equivalent to \"\u00ac\u00acF \u2192 \u00acB\" (double negation law), and then we can apply the contrapositive law to get \"B \u2192 \u00acF\". The contrapositive law states that \"A \u2192 B\" is logically equivalent to \"\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA\". Therefore, applying this law to our original statement allows us to infer the second statement logically.\n\nAnswer: yes",
