            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statement into a logical form. Let's denote \"the dreb was vroombed\" as V and \"the dreb was spened\" as S. The original statement is \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was not spened,\" which translates to \"If V, then not S\" or V \u2192 \u00acS.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of V \u2192 \u00acS is \u00ac(\u00acS) \u2192 \u00acV, which simplifies to S \u2192 \u00acV. This translates back to \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\" from the original statement, as it is the contrapositive of the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
