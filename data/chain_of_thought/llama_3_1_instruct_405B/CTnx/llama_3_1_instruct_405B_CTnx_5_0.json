            "content": "Explanation: To approach this question, we need to understand the logical relationship between the given statement and the statement we are asked to infer. The original statement is \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled.\" This can be represented in a conditional form as \"F \u2192 \u00acS\", where F represents \"the zinger was fraggled\" and S represents \"the zinger was smoogled\".\n\nThe statement we are asked to infer is \"If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled,\" which can be represented as \"S \u2192 \u00acF\".\n\nIn logic, the original statement \"F \u2192 \u00acS\" is equivalent to saying \"\u00ac\u00acF \u2192 \u00acS\" (double negation on F), but it does not directly imply \"S \u2192 \u00acF\". However, we can use the contrapositive rule to find an equivalent statement. The contrapositive of \"F \u2192 \u00acS\" is \"S \u2192 \u00acF\", which exactly matches the statement we are asked to infer.\n\nThe contrapositive rule states that a conditional statement \"P \u2192 Q\" is logically equivalent to \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\". Applying this rule to the original statement \"F \u2192 \u00acS\", we get \"\u00ac\u00acS \u2192 \u00acF\", which simplifies to \"S \u2192 \u00acF\". This means that if the zinger was smoogled, then it was not fraggled.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer \"If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
