            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statement into a logical form. The original statement is \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was not garpled.\" This can be represented as \"S \u2192 \u00acG\", where S stands for \"the wug was sproinged\" and G stands for \"the wug was garpled\". The statement we are trying to infer is \"If the wug was garpled, then the wug was not sproinged,\" which can be represented as \"G \u2192 \u00acS\".\n\nIn classical logic, the original statement \"S \u2192 \u00acG\" is logically equivalent to \"\u00ac\u00acS \u2192 \u00acG\" (since any statement S is logically equivalent to \u00ac\u00acS), which simplifies to \"S \u2192 \u00acG\". However, the statement we are trying to infer, \"G \u2192 \u00acS\", is the contrapositive of \"S \u2192 \u00acG\". The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"S \u2192 \u00acG\" is indeed \"\u00ac\u00acG \u2192 \u00acS\", which simplifies to \"G \u2192 \u00acS\".\n\nTherefore, from \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was not garpled,\" we can logically infer \"If the wug was garpled, then the wug was not sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
