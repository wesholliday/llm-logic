            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, we can apply the rules of logical inference, specifically focusing on the given statement and its contrapositive. The original statement is \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble did not crink.\" This can be represented in a conditional form as \"If A, then not B,\" where A is \"the fribble was snurgled\" and B is \"the fribble did crink.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of \"If A, then not B\" is \"If B, then not A.\" The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nApplying this to our original statement, the contrapositive would be \"If the fribble did crink, then the fribble was not snurgled.\" This matches the statement we are asked to infer.\n\nTherefore, from the original statement \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble did not crink,\" we can indeed infer \"If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
