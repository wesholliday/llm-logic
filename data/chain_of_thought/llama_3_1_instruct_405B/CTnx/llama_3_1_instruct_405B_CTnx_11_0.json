            "content": "Explanation: To approach this question, we need to understand the logical structure of the given statement and the statement we are trying to infer. The original statement is of the form \"If A, then not B\" (If the flug was blummed, then the flug was not zimmed). We are trying to infer a statement of the form \"If B, then not A\" (If the flug was zimmed, then the flug was not blummed).\n\nIn logical terms, the original statement can be represented as A \u2192 \u00acB, where \"A\" represents \"the flug was blummed,\" \"B\" represents \"the flug was zimmed,\" and \"\u00ac\" denotes negation. The statement we are trying to infer is B \u2192 \u00acA.\n\nThe given statement implies that being blummed and being zimmed are mutually exclusive states for a flug; if one happens, the other cannot happen. This mutual exclusivity supports the inference because if the flug was zimmed, it means the condition for it not being blummed is met, given the initial premise that being blummed would prevent it from being zimmed.\n\nTherefore, logically, if we accept \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was not zimmed\" as true, we can infer \"If the flug was zimmed, then the flug was not blummed\" because both statements express a relationship where one condition precludes the other.\n\nAnswer: yes",
