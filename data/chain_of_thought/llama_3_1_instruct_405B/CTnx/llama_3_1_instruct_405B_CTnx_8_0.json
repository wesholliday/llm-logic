            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statement and the statement we're trying to infer into logical terms. The original statement is \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled.\" This can be represented as \"C \u2192 \u00acD\", where C stands for \"the sprocket was cranked\" and D stands for \"the sprocket was daggled\". The statement we're trying to infer is \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked,\" which can be represented as \"D \u2192 \u00acC\".\n\nIn logic, the original statement \"C \u2192 \u00acD\" is equivalent to \"D \u2192 \u00acC\" by the principle of contrapositive inference. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa. The contrapositive of \"C \u2192 \u00acD\" is indeed \"D \u2192 \u00acC\", which matches the statement we're trying to infer.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\" from the original statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
