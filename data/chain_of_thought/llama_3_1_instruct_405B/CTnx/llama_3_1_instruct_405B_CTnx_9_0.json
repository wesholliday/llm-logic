            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statement and the statement we're trying to infer into logical terms. The original statement is \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was not varnished.\" This can be represented as \"P \u2192 \u00acV\", where P stands for \"the twonk was plinked\" and V stands for \"the twonk was varnished\". The statement we're trying to infer is \"If the twonk was varnished, then the twonk was not plinked,\" which can be represented as \"V \u2192 \u00acP\".\n\nIn logic, the original statement \"P \u2192 \u00acV\" is equivalent to \"V \u2192 \u00acP\" by the principle of contrapositive inference. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa. The contrapositive of \"P \u2192 \u00acV\" is indeed \"V \u2192 \u00acP\", which matches the statement we're trying to infer.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer \"If the twonk was varnished, then the twonk was not plinked\" from the original statement \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was not varnished\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
