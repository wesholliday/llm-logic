            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. The first statement is \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" This is a conditional statement that connects the material of the doll to the material of the truck. The second statement is \"it's not the case that the truck must have been metal,\" which directly contradicts the consequence of the first statement.\n\nFrom the second statement, we understand that there is no necessity for the truck to be metal, which means the condition that would have necessitated the truck to be metal (the doll being plastic) might not hold. This is because if the doll being plastic necessarily meant the truck had to be metal, and we know the truck doesn't have to be metal, it suggests the premise (the doll being plastic) could be false.\n\nTherefore, given that the condition which would require the truck to be metal (the doll being plastic) is not necessarily true because the truck doesn't have to be metal, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
