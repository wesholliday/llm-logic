            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements into logical expressions. The first statement can be represented as \"If A, then B\" where A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana must have been yellow\". The second statement says \"it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow\", which can be represented as \"not B\". \n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. However, from the second statement, we know that the banana was not necessarily yellow, which directly contradicts the consequence of the first statement. \n\nSince the consequence (the banana must have been yellow) of the condition (the apple was red) is negated, we can infer that the condition itself (the apple was red) must not be true. This is because if the condition were true, then according to the first statement, the banana must have been yellow, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
