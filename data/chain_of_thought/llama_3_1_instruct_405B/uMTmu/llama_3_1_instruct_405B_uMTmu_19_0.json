            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements into logical expressions. The first statement can be represented as \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball,\" which translates to \"Tom watched football \u2192 Jen watched basketball.\" The second statement says, \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball,\" which can be understood as \"Not (Jen watched basketball)\" since \"must have\" implies necessity, and negating it implies that it's not a necessity, hence it didn't happen.\n\nGiven these, we can infer logically. If Tom watching football necessitates Jen watching basketball, but we know Jen did not watch basketball, then the premise that leads to Jen watching basketball (Tom watching football) cannot be true. This is based on the principle of modus tollens, which states that if A \u2192 B and Not B, then Not A.\n\nTherefore, from the information provided, we can logically infer that Tom did not watch football because if he had, it would have led to a consequence (Jen watching basketball) that we know did not occur.\n\nAnswer: yes",
