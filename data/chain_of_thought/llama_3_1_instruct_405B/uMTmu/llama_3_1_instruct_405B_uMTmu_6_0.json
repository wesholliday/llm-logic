The first statement is a conditional: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\" This means that if the condition (Sue chose pizza) is true, then the consequence (Bob must have chosen pasta) must also be true. However, the second statement directly contradicts the consequence of the first statement by saying \"it's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.\" This indicates that the condition which would necessitate Bob choosing pasta (Sue choosing pizza) did not occur, because if it had, then Bob would have had to choose pasta, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
