            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the information given. The first statement is a conditional: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as \"Lisa bought the red shirt \u2192 Mark bought the blue shirt.\" The second statement is a negation of the conclusion of the first statement: \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt,\" which means Mark did not buy the blue shirt. \n\nGiven the conditional statement, if Lisa buying the red shirt necessarily leads to Mark buying the blue shirt, but we know Mark did not buy the blue shirt, we can infer that the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) did not occur. This is because in a conditional statement \"If A then B,\" if B is false, then A must also be false for the statement to hold true.\n\nTherefore, since Mark did not buy the blue shirt, and the conditional states that if Lisa bought the red shirt then Mark would have bought the blue shirt, we can logically conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
