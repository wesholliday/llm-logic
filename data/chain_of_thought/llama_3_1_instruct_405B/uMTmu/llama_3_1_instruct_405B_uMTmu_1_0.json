            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. The first statement is a conditional: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This can be represented as \"Mary \u2192 Sue.\" The second statement is \"it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding,\" which implies that Sue's presence is not a necessity, or in logical terms, \"\u00ac(Sue must have been at the wedding).\" However, this does not directly negate Sue's presence but indicates that her presence is not a must. It does not provide information about whether Sue was actually at the wedding or not. To infer that Mary was not at the wedding based on these statements would require that the second statement directly negates the possibility of Sue being at the wedding, which it does not. Instead, it speaks to the necessity of her presence. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that Mary was not at the wedding from the given information because the second statement does not confirm Sue's absence but rather addresses the necessity of her presence.\n\nAnswer: no",
