            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This means that Mary's presence at the wedding guarantees Sue's presence. The second statement introduces uncertainty about Sue's attendance, stating that \"Sue might not have been at the wedding.\" This implies that we cannot be certain whether Sue was at the wedding or not. Now, combining these two pieces of information, if Sue might not have been at the wedding, and Mary's presence would guarantee Sue's presence, then we can infer that Mary could not have been at the wedding. If Mary had been at the wedding, it would contradict the possibility that Sue might not have been there, because Mary's presence would ensure Sue's presence according to the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
