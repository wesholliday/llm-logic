The first statement is \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\" This implies a direct relationship where Alex finishing the race guarantees that Chris also finished. The second statement is \"Chris might not have finished the race.\" This introduces uncertainty about Chris's completion of the race. \n\nGiven these statements, if we assume Alex finished the race, it contradicts the possibility that Chris might not have finished, because the first statement makes it mandatory for Chris to finish if Alex finishes. Therefore, the only way Chris might not have finished is if Alex did not finish, which would break the mandatory link between Alex's and Chris's race completion as stated in the first condition.\n\nAnswer: yes",
