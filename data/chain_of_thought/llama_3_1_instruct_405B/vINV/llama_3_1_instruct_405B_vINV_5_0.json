            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise states \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be represented symbolically as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\" The conclusion states \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis,\" which can be represented as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ.\n\nIn logic, the given argument form is attempting to apply a rule that resembles the contrapositive, but in reverse. The contrapositive states that if P \u2192 Q, then \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP. However, the argument in question is trying to assert that if P \u2192 Q, then \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ, which is not a logically valid form. This form is known as the \"fallacy of denying the antecedent\" because it incorrectly assumes that if the antecedent (P) is denied (\u00acP), then the consequent (Q) must also be denied (\u00acQ), which does not logically follow from the original premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument's form is not logically valid because it incorrectly assumes a relationship between the negation of the premise and the negation of the conclusion that does not follow from the original premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
