            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise states, \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the vampire was awake\" and Q is \"the mummy was awake.\" The conclusion states, \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake,\" which is also a conditional statement but of the form \"If not P, then not Q.\" The conclusion is attempting to make an inference based on the negation of the antecedent (the vampire was awake) to the negation of the consequent (the mummy was awake).\n\nHowever, the original premise only guarantees that if the vampire is awake, the mummy is awake. It does not provide information about the state of the mummy if the vampire is not awake. The mummy could still be awake even if the vampire is not, as the premise does not establish a necessary condition for the mummy being awake, only a sufficient one.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because it assumes a relationship between the negations of the premise that is not supported by the premise itself. This is a classic example of the fallacy of denying the antecedent.\n\nAnswer: no",
