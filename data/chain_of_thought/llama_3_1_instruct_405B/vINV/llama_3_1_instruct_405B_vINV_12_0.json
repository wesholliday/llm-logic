            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. The premise is given as \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo,\" which can be symbolized as P \u2192 Q, where P represents \"Joe went to the park\" and Q represents \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" The conclusion is \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo,\" which can be symbolized as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ.\n\nThe argument form is:\n\nP \u2192 Q\n\u2234 \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ\n\nThis form is attempting to make a conclusion about the inverse of the original statement based solely on the original conditional statement. However, from the premise P \u2192 Q, we cannot logically conclude \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ without additional information. The original premise only guarantees that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo; it does not provide information about what happens if Joe did not go to the park. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce the conclusion from the given premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
