            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise states \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue,\" which can be symbolized as \"R \u2192 B\" (where R represents \"the car was red\" and B represents \"the truck was blue\"). The conclusion states \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue,\" which can be symbolized as \"\u00acR \u2192 \u00acB\" (where \u00ac represents negation).\n\nThe argument form is trying to assert a relationship between the color of the car and the color of the truck based on the initial condition. However, the conclusion attempts to draw a definitive conclusion about the color of the truck based solely on the car not being red. This conclusion does not logically follow from the premise because the premise only specifies what happens if the car is red; it does not provide information about the truck's color if the car is not red. The truck could still be blue even if the car is not red, or it could be any other color. The premise does not restrict the truck's color in scenarios where the car is not red.\n\nTherefore, the argument form is not logically valid because it tries to infer a conclusion that is not supported by the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
