            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. The premise is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" which can be symbolized as \"M \u2192 S\" (where \"M\" stands for \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \"S\" stands for \"Sue was at the wedding\"). The conclusion is \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding,\" which can be symbolized as \"\u00acM \u2192 \u00acS\" (where \"\u00ac\" denotes negation, meaning \"not\").\n\nThe argument form is thus: M \u2192 S, therefore \u00acM \u2192 \u00acS. This form is attempting to make an inference from a conditional statement to its inverse. However, the inverse of a conditional statement does not logically follow from the original statement. The original statement only asserts that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding; it does not provide information about the situation where Mary was not at the wedding. Sue could still have been at the wedding even if Mary was not.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise, making the argument form logically invalid.\n\nAnswer: no",
