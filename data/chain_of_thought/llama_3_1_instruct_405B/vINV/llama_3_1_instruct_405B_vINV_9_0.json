            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise states \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as \"If A, then B\" or A \u2192 B. The conclusion states \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt,\" which can be represented as \"If not A, then not B\" or \u00acA \u2192 \u00acB.\n\nThe argument form is trying to assert a relationship between A and B and then conclude a relationship between not A and not B based on that. However, the original premise only guarantees that if A happens, B happens. It does not provide information about what happens if A does not occur. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that if A does not happen, B does not happen based solely on the premise given.\n\nThis type of argument is attempting to make an inverse inference, which is not logically valid without additional premises that explicitly state the inverse relationship. The original premise does not exclude the possibility of Mark buying the blue shirt even if Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
