            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. The premise is \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as \"If A, then B\" or \"A \u2192 B,\" where A is \"the book was written by James\" and B is \"the book is a mystery novel.\" The conclusion is \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel,\" which can be represented as \"If not A, then not B\" or \"\u00acA \u2192 \u00acB.\"\n\nThe argument form is trying to assert a conclusion about the inverse relationship based on the original conditional statement. However, the original statement only provides information about what happens if the book was written by James; it does not provide information about what happens if the book was not written by James. In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement does not logically follow from the statement itself. The inverse would need to be independently established or the original statement would need to be an \"if and only if\" statement for the conclusion to logically follow.\n\nTherefore, the argument form is not logically valid because it incorrectly assumes that the inverse of the original conditional statement is true without sufficient evidence.\n\nAnswer: no",
