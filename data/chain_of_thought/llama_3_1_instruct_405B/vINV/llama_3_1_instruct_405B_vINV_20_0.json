            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. The premise is given as \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow,\" which we can represent symbolically as \"R \u2192 Y\" (where R stands for \"the apple was red\" and Y stands for \"the banana was yellow\"). The conclusion is \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow,\" which can be represented symbolically as \"\u00acR \u2192 \u00acY\" (where \u00ac represents negation).\n\nThe argument form is thus: R \u2192 Y, therefore \u00acR \u2192 \u00acY. This form is attempting to make an inference from a conditional statement to its inverse. However, in logic, the inverse of a conditional statement does not logically follow from the original statement. The inverse is a separate claim that requires its own evidence or reasoning.\n\nFor example, just because being an apple implies being a fruit (if A then F), it doesn't logically follow that not being an apple implies not being a fruit (if not A then not F), because there are other fruits besides apples.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise, making the argument form logically invalid.\n\nAnswer: no",
