            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise states \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This can be represented symbolically as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball.\" The conclusion states \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball,\" which can be represented as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ.\n\nThe argument form is trying to assert a relationship between the original conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and its inverse (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ). However, the inverse of a conditional statement does not logically follow from the original statement. The original statement only guarantees that if P is true, then Q must be true; it does not provide any information about the relationship when P is false.\n\nIn logic, the form of argument that would be valid given the original premise (P \u2192 Q) is the contrapositive, which states that if Q is not true, then P cannot be true (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP). This is not what the conclusion is asserting, however. The conclusion is asserting the inverse (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ), which does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nTherefore, the form of argument presented is not logically valid because it incorrectly assumes that the inverse of a conditional statement logically follows from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
