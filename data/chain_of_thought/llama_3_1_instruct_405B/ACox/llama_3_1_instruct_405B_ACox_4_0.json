We are given a fact: 'The fribble crinked'.\n2. We are also given a conditional statement: 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked'. This statement is of the form 'If A, then B', where A is 'the fribble was snurgled' and B is 'the fribble crinked'.\n\nFrom the conditional statement, we know that if A (the fribble was snurgled) is true, then B (the fribble crinked) must also be true. However, we are not given that A is true; we are only given that B is true.\n\nThe logical fallacy of affirming the consequent would occur if we concluded that because B is true (the fribble crinked), A must also be true (the fribble was snurgled). This conclusion is not logically justified because there could be other reasons why the fribble crinked that do not involve it being snurgled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically infer that 'The fribble was snurgled'.\n\nAnswer: no",
