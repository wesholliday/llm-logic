The second statement is 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat was quanked'. This second statement sets up a condition where being morphed leads to being quanked, but it does not state that being quanked means the splat was morphed. There could be other reasons why the splat was quanked that do not involve it being morphed. Therefore, from the information given, we cannot logically infer that 'The splat was morphed' simply because it was quanked.\n\nAnswer: no",
