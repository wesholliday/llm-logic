            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements and apply logical reasoning. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as \"A \u2192 B,\" where A is \"the book was written by James\" and B is \"the book is a mystery novel.\" The second statement is \"The book was not written by James,\" which can be represented as \"\u00acA\" (not A).\n\nFrom the conditional statement, we can only infer that if A is true, then B must be true. However, if A is false (the book was not written by James), we cannot make any direct conclusion about B (whether the book is a mystery novel or not) based solely on the given conditional statement. This is because the conditional statement only guarantees B if A is true, but it does not provide information about B if A is false.\n\nTherefore, from \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" and \"The book was not written by James,\" we cannot logically infer \"The book is not a mystery novel.\" The book could still be a mystery novel written by someone else.\n\nAnswer: no",
