            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt' from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'. This means if the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the consequence (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true. However, it does not provide information about what happens if the condition is false.\n\n2. The second statement is 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt'. This directly negates the condition of the first statement, meaning the conditional statement does not apply in this scenario because its condition is not met.\n\n3. Since the condition for the first statement is not met, we cannot directly infer anything about Mark buying the blue shirt based on the given conditional statement. The conditional statement only provides information about what would happen if Lisa bought the red shirt, not what would happen if she did not.\n\n4. Therefore, we cannot logically infer 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt' from the given statements because the negation of the condition in the first statement does not necessarily negate the consequence. Mark could still have bought the blue shirt for reasons not covered by the conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
