            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements and apply basic principles of logic.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This can be represented as \"Tom watched football \u2192 Jen watched basketball.\" In logic, this kind of statement does not assert that either condition actually happened; it only establishes a relationship between the two conditions.\n\n2. The second statement is a negation: \"Tom did not watch football.\" This directly tells us that the condition for the first statement (Tom watching football) was not met.\n\n3. The question asks if we can infer \"Jen did not watch basketball\" from these statements. \n\nGiven the conditional nature of the first statement, if Tom had watched football, we could infer that Jen watched basketball. However, since Tom did not watch football, the condition that would allow us to make a conclusion about Jen's actions is not met. The statements do not provide a direct link from Tom not watching football to Jen's actions. In logic, the negation of the antecedent (Tom not watching football) does not necessarily imply the negation of the consequent (Jen not watching basketball). There is no information provided about what Jen does if Tom does not watch football.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that Jen did not watch basketball based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
