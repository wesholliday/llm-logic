            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into logical expressions. Let V represent \"the vampire was awake\" and M represent \"the mummy was awake.\" The first statement, \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake,\" can be represented as V \u2192 M. The second statement, \"The vampire was not awake,\" is represented as \u00acV.\n\nFrom the first statement, V \u2192 M, we can infer that if the vampire was awake, the mummy must also have been awake. However, it does not explicitly state that if the vampire was not awake, the mummy was not awake. It only guarantees the mummy's wakefulness if the vampire is awake.\n\nThe second statement, \u00acV, tells us the vampire was not awake. Since V \u2192 M only guarantees M if V is true, and we know V is not true, we cannot directly infer the state of the mummy's wakefulness from these statements alone. The mummy could be awake or not awake regardless of the vampire's state, as the first statement only provides a condition for the mummy's wakefulness if the vampire is awake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer \"The mummy was not awake\" from the given statements because the condition that would necessitate the mummy's wakefulness (the vampire being awake) is not met, leaving the mummy's state undetermined by these statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
