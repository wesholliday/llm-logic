            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements and apply basic principles of logic.\n\n1. The first statement is \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the car was red\" and B is \"the truck was blue.\" This statement only guarantees that if A is true, B must also be true. However, it does not provide information about the color of the truck if the car is not red.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The car was not red.\" This directly negates the condition (A) of the first statement. Since the condition for the truck being blue (the car being red) is not met, we cannot infer the color of the truck from the first statement.\n\n3. The question asks if we can infer \"The truck was not blue\" from these statements. Given that the first statement only specifies what would happen if the car was red and does not address the scenario where the car is not red, we cannot make any direct inference about the truck's color when the car is not red.\n\n4. In logic, the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Just because the condition for the truck to be blue (the car being red) is not met, it does not automatically mean the truck was not blue. The truck's color remains unspecified in the scenario where the car is not red.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer \"The truck was not blue\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
