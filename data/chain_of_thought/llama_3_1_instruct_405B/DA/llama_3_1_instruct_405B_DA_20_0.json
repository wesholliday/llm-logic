            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements and apply basic principles of logic.\n\n1. The first statement is \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana was yellow.\" This statement does not assert that the apple was red or that the banana was yellow; it only establishes a relationship between the two conditions.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The apple was not red.\" This directly negates the condition A from the first statement.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot infer that \"The banana was not yellow.\" The reason is that the first statement only provides information about the banana's color if the apple is red. It does not provide any information about the banana's color if the apple is not red. The banana could still be yellow, or it could be any other color; we simply do not have enough information to determine this based on the given statements.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer the banana's color from the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
