            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements and analyze them logically.\n\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This statement implies a conditional relationship where Mary's presence at the wedding guarantees Sue's presence. However, it does not guarantee that Sue's presence is dependent only on Mary's presence. Sue could be at the wedding for reasons unrelated to Mary.\n\n2. \"Mary was not at the wedding.\" This statement provides a fact that we can use in conjunction with the first statement.\n\nFrom the first statement, we cannot infer that Sue's presence at the wedding is solely dependent on Mary's presence. There could be other reasons for Sue to be at the wedding, even if Mary is not. The first statement only guarantees that if Mary is there, Sue will be there, but it does not guarantee that if Mary is not there, Sue will not be there.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer \"Sue was not at the wedding\" from the given statements because Sue's presence is not necessarily dependent on Mary's presence.\n\nAnswer: no",
