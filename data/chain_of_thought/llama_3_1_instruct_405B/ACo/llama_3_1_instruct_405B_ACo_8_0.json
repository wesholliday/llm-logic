The second statement is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake,\" which is a conditional statement. It implies that the wakefulness of the vampire is a sufficient condition for the wakefulness of the mummy, but it does not necessarily mean that the vampire being awake is the only condition under which the mummy can be awake. There could be other reasons why the mummy is awake. Therefore, knowing that the mummy is awake does not necessarily allow us to infer that the vampire is awake, as there might be other causes for the mummy's wakefulness.\n\nAnswer: no",
