The second statement, \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry,\" is a conditional statement that connects the type of cake to the type of muffins. However, this statement only guarantees that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would be blueberry, but it does not rule out the possibility of the muffins being blueberry under other conditions (e.g., the cake being vanilla or any other flavor). Therefore, knowing that the muffins were indeed blueberry does not necessarily imply that the cake was chocolate, as there could be other reasons why the muffins were blueberry.\n\nAnswer: no",
