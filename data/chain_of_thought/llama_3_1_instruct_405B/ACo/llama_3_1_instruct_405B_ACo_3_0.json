The first statement tells us that 'The book is a mystery novel'. This gives us information about the genre of the book but does not provide any information about the author.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel'. This statement tells us that if James is the author, then the book must be a mystery novel. However, it does not tell us that if the book is a mystery novel, then James must be the author. There could be other authors who write mystery novels.\n\n3. From these statements, we cannot conclude that 'The book was written by James' simply because the book is a mystery novel. The second statement does not exclude the possibility of other authors writing mystery novels.\n\n4. Therefore, the information given does not logically lead to the conclusion that James is the author of the book.\n\nAnswer: no",
