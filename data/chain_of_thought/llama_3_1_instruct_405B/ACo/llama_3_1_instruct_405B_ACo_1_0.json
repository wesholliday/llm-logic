            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Mary was at the wedding' from the given statements, let's analyze the information step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is 'Sue was at the wedding'. This statement gives us a fact about Sue's presence but does not provide any direct information about Mary.\n\n2. The second statement is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding'. This is a conditional statement that tells us if Mary was present, then Sue must have been present as well. However, it does not guarantee that if Sue was present, Mary must have been there too.\n\nGiven these statements, we can see that the presence of Sue is a necessary condition for Mary's presence (according to the conditional statement), but it is not a sufficient condition to conclude that Mary was at the wedding. In other words, just because Sue was at the wedding (which is the fact given in the first statement), it does not necessarily mean that Mary was also there. The conditional statement only guarantees that if Mary was there, Sue would be there, but it does not work the other way around.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Mary was at the wedding' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
