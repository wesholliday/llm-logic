This statement means that if A is true, then B must also be true. However, it does not imply that if B is true, then A must also be true. In other words, just because Chris finished the race, it does not necessarily mean that Alex finished the race. There could be other reasons why Chris finished the race that are unrelated to Alex's performance. The statement only guarantees that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race, but it does not provide any information about the converse.\n\nAnswer: no",
