            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement, often represented in logic as \"If P, then Q\" or \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding\". This type of statement only guarantees that if the condition (P) is true, then the consequence (Q) is also true. It does not guarantee the reverse: that if the consequence (Q) is true, then the condition (P) must be true. The truth of the consequence (Q) does not necessarily imply the truth of the condition (P). Given that \"Sue was at the wedding\" (Q) is true, we cannot logically conclude that \"Mary was at the wedding\" (P) must be true based solely on the conditional statement and the truth of its consequence.\n\nAnswer: no",
