The conditional statement only guarantees that if Alex finished, then Chris finished; it does not guarantee the converse\u2014that if Chris finished, then Alex finished. Therefore, knowing that Chris finished does not allow us to deduce that Alex finished, as there is no information provided that would necessitate Alex finishing the race in order for Chris to finish.\n\nAnswer: no",
