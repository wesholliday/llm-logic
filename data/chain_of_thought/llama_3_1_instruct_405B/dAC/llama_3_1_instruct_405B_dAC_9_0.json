            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into a logical form. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as \"A \u2192 B,\" where A is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and B is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" The second statement is simply \"Mark bought the blue shirt,\" which is B.\n\nFrom the conditional statement \"A \u2192 B,\" we can infer that if B is true, it does not necessarily mean A is true. The statement only guarantees that if A is true, then B must be true. It does not guarantee the reverse. Therefore, knowing that Mark bought the blue shirt (B is true) does not allow us to deduce that Lisa bought the red shirt (A is true) because there could be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt that do not involve Lisa buying the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
