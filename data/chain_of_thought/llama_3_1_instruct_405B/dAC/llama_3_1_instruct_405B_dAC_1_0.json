            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into logical expressions. Let M represent \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S represent \"Sue was at the wedding\". The first statement, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" can be represented as M \u2192 S. The second statement, \"Sue was at the wedding,\" is simply S.\n\nGiven these, we're trying to deduce M (Mary was at the wedding).\n\nThe logical expression we have is M \u2192 S, and we know S is true. However, knowing S is true does not necessarily mean M is true because the conditional statement M \u2192 S only guarantees that if M is true, then S must be true. It does not guarantee the reverse: that if S is true, M must be true. There could be other reasons S is true that have nothing to do with M.\n\nFor example, consider the statement \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" If we know the ground is wet, we cannot conclude it is raining because there are other reasons the ground could be wet (e.g., a burst pipe, a flood, etc.).\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot logically deduce that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
