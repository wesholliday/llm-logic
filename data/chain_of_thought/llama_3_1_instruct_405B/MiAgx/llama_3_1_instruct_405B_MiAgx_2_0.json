            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is \"The frazzle might be on the zump and the gribble might wozzle a frazzle grooble.\" This sentence is using the word \"might\" to express possibility for two separate events: the frazzle being on the zump and the gribble wozzling a frazzle grooble. When we rephrase it to \"It might be that the frazzle is on the zump and the gribble wozzles a frazzle grooble,\" we are essentially combining the two possibilities into a single possibility without changing the meaning of the original statement. The rephrased sentence still expresses that both events could happen, maintaining the same level of uncertainty as the original. The change is more about sentence structure and less about altering the meaning or the conditions described.\n\nAnswer: yes",
