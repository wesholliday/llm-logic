            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is composed of two parts connected by 'and': 'The flimble might be at wozzle wozzle' and 'the gribble might be in the snork wozzle'. Each part expresses a possibility regarding the location of a different object (the flimble and the gribble). When we connect these possibilities with 'and', we are essentially saying that both possibilities could coexist. \n\nInferring 'It might be that the flimble is at wozzle wozzle and the gribble is in the snork wozzle' from the original statement is essentially rephrasing it to explicitly state that there is a possibility that both conditions are true at the same time. This rephrased statement does not alter the meaning of the original statement but rather clarifies that the conjunction of these two possibilities is itself a possibility.\n\nTherefore, the inference is logically sound because it does not introduce any new information that contradicts the original statement, but rather makes explicit the combined possibility that was implicit in the conjunction of the two individual possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes",
