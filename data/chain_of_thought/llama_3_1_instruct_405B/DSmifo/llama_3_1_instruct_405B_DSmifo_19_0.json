The first statement, \"The watch might not be on his wrist,\" indicates uncertainty about the watch's location but suggests it's possible it's not on his wrist. The second statement, \"Either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser,\" provides two specific locations for the watch: on his wrist or charging on the dresser. This statement implies that these are the only two possibilities for the watch's location at the moment. \n\nGiven that the watch might not be on his wrist (from the first statement), and considering the second statement which says the watch is either on his wrist or charging on the dresser, we can infer that if the watch is not on his wrist, then it must be charging on the dresser, as these are presented as the only two options.\n\nAnswer: yes",
