            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the information given. The first statement, \"The book might not be resting on the table,\" indicates uncertainty about the book's location but suggests it's possible the book is not on the table. The second statement, \"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf,\" presents two possible locations for the book: on the table or on the shelf. This statement implies that these are the only two possibilities for the book's location.\n\nGiven that the book might not be on the table (from the first statement), and considering the second statement which says the book is either on the table or on the shelf, we can infer that if the book is not on the table, then it must be on the shelf. This is because the second statement presents these two options as the only possibilities.\n\nTherefore, combining the uncertainty from the first statement with the binary choice from the second statement, we can logically conclude that if there's a possibility the book is not on the table, and the only other option is that it's on the shelf, then yes, we can infer the book is on the shelf if it's not on the table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
