            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the information given. The first statement is \"Sue was not at the wedding.\" This is a straightforward statement about Sue's absence. The second statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This means that Mary's presence at the wedding implies Sue's presence. Given that we know Sue was not at the wedding, we can use this information to infer something about Mary's presence. If Mary's presence necessarily means Sue's presence (as per the conditional statement), and we know Sue was not present, then it must be the case that Mary was not present. This is because if Mary were present, Sue would have to be present as well (according to the conditional statement), which contradicts the information that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
