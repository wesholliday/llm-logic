The second statement is \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This is a conditional statement that connects the type of cake to the type of muffins. \n\nTo infer something about the cake, we need to use the information about the muffins in conjunction with the conditional statement. Since we know the muffins were not blueberry, and the conditional statement tells us that if the cake was chocolate, the muffins would be blueberry, we can deduce that the condition (the cake being chocolate) must not have been met. This is because if the condition had been met (cake being chocolate), the consequence (muffins being blueberry) would have occurred, which contradicts the first statement that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nTherefore, since the condition that would lead to blueberry muffins (the cake being chocolate) did not occur (because we know the muffins were not blueberry), we can infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
