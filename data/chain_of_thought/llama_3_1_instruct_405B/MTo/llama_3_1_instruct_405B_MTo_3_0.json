            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the information given. The first statement is \"The book is not a mystery novel.\" This is a direct statement about the genre of the book. The second statement is \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This is a conditional statement that connects the authorship of the book to its genre. \n\nTo infer whether \"The book was not written by James,\" we need to consider the implications of these statements together. If the book being written by James means it must be a mystery novel, but we know it's not a mystery novel, then logically, James cannot be the author. This is because if James were the author, the book would have to be a mystery novel, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nThis type of reasoning is an example of modus tollens, a rule of logic that states if we have \"If A, then B\" and \"not B,\" we can conclude \"not A.\" Here, \"A\" is \"the book was written by James,\" and \"B\" is \"the book is a mystery novel.\" Given \"not B\" (the book is not a mystery novel), we can conclude \"not A\" (the book was not written by James).\n\nAnswer: yes",
