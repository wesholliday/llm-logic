            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the information given. We know that Bob did not choose pasta. We also know that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. This sets up a conditional relationship where Sue choosing pizza would necessitate Bob choosing pasta. However, since we are told that Bob did not choose pasta, this means the condition that would have been met if Sue chose pizza is not met. Therefore, given that Bob did not choose pasta, it must be the case that Sue did not choose pizza because if she had, Bob would have chosen pasta, which contradicts the information given.\n\nAnswer: yes",
