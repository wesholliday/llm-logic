            "content": "Explanation: Let's analyze the given statements step by step. The first statement is \"Jen did not watch basketball.\" This is a straightforward statement about Jen's actions. The second statement is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement that connects Tom's action (watching football) to Jen's action (watching basketball). It implies that if Tom watched football, then it must be the case that Jen watched basketball.\n\nGiven that we know Jen did not watch basketball from the first statement, we can use this information to infer something about Tom's actions based on the conditional statement. If Jen did not watch basketball, and the conditional statement says that Jen watching basketball is a necessary outcome of Tom watching football, then it must be the case that Tom did not watch football. This is because if Tom had watched football, according to the conditional statement, Jen would have watched basketball, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nTherefore, by combining the information from both statements, we can logically infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
