            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the information given. We have two statements: \"The pants were not denim\" and \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" The second statement is a conditional statement that connects the material of the shirt with the material of the pants. It implies that if the shirt is made of cotton, then the pants must be made of denim. However, we are told that the pants were not denim, which directly contradicts the outcome of the conditional statement if the shirt were cotton. Therefore, since the condition that the pants were denim is not met (because we know the pants were not denim), we can infer that the initial condition of the shirt being cotton must not be true. This is because in a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" if B is not true, then A cannot be true if the conditional statement is to hold. Thus, we can logically conclude that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
