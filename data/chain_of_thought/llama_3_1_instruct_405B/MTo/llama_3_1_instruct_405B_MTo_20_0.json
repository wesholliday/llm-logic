            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the information given. The first statement is \"The banana was not yellow.\" This is a direct statement about the color of the banana. The second statement is \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This is a conditional statement that connects the color of the apple to the color of the banana. To infer something about the color of the apple from these statements, we need to see how they logically connect.\n\nThe conditional statement sets up a relationship where if the condition (the apple was red) is true, then the consequence (the banana was yellow) must also be true. However, we are told that the banana was not yellow, which directly contradicts the consequence of the conditional statement. Therefore, since the consequence (the banana was yellow) is false, the condition (the apple was red) must also be false because a true condition cannot lead to a false consequence in a valid conditional statement.\n\nThis type of reasoning is based on the principle of modus tollens, which states that if we have \"If A, then B\" and we know \"not B,\" we can conclude \"not A.\" Applying this principle here, we conclude that the apple was not red because we have the conditional \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" and we know \"the banana was not yellow.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
