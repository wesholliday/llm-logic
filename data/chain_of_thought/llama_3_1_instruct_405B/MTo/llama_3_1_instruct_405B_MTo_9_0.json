            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the information given. We have two statements: \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" and \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" The second statement is a conditional statement that connects Lisa's purchase of the red shirt to Mark's purchase of the blue shirt. If we know that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then the condition for Lisa buying the red shirt (as linked to Mark's purchase) cannot be fulfilled because the outcome (Mark buying the blue shirt) did not occur. Therefore, based on the given conditional statement, if Mark did not buy the blue shirt, it implies that Lisa could not have bought the red shirt because if she had, Mark would have bought the blue shirt, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
