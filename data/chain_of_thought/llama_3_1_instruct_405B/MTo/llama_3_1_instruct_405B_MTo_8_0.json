            "content": "Explanation: Let's analyze the given statements step by step. The first statement is \"The mummy was not awake.\" This is a direct assertion about the state of the mummy. The second statement is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This is a conditional statement that connects the state of the vampire to the state of the mummy. It implies that the mummy being awake is a necessary condition for the vampire to be awake. Given that we know the mummy was not awake from the first statement, we can infer that the condition for the vampire to be awake (the mummy being awake) was not met. Therefore, based on the information provided and the logical connection between the two statements, we can deduce the state of the vampire.\n\nAnswer: yes",
