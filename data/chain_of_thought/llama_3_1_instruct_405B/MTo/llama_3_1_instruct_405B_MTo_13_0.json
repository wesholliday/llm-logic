            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the information given. We have two statements: \"The truck was not blue\" and \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" The first statement gives us a direct fact about the color of the truck. The second statement gives us a conditional relationship between the color of the car and the color of the truck.\n\nFrom the second statement, \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue,\" we can infer that if the condition (the car being red) leads to a conclusion (the truck being blue), but we know from the first statement that the conclusion (the truck being blue) is false, then the condition (the car being red) must also be false. This is based on the principle of modus tollens in logic, which states that if we have \"If A, then B\" and we know \"not B,\" then we can conclude \"not A.\"\n\nTherefore, since we know the truck was not blue, and the statement that \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" implies that the truck being blue is a consequence of the car being red, we can conclude that the car was not red because the consequence (truck being blue) did not occur.\n\nAnswer: yes",
