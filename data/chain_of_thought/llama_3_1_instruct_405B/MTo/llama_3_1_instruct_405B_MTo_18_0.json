            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step. The first statement is \"The truck was not metal.\" This gives us a direct piece of information about the material of the truck. The second statement is \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This is a conditional statement that connects the material of the doll to the material of the truck. \n\nTo infer whether \"The doll was not plastic,\" we need to see if the given statements logically lead to this conclusion. The second statement implies that if the doll was indeed plastic, then the truck would have to be metal. However, we know from the first statement that the truck was not metal. \n\nGiven this contradiction, if we assume the doll was plastic, it would lead to a false conclusion about the truck being metal, which contradicts the given fact. Therefore, to maintain logical consistency, we must conclude that the assumption about the doll being plastic cannot be true because it leads to a contradiction with known facts.\n\nAnswer: yes",
