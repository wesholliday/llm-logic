            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Mark bought the blue shirt' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements. The first statement, 'Lisa bought the red shirt', is a simple assertion. The second statement, 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt', is a conditional statement that connects the action of Lisa buying the red shirt to Mark buying the blue shirt. In logic, when we have a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B' and we know that A is true, we can conclude that B is true. This is known as modus ponens, a fundamental rule of inference in logic. Given that we know Lisa bought the red shirt (A is true), and we have the conditional statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' (If A, then B), we can logically infer that Mark bought the blue shirt (B is true).\n\nAnswer: yes",
