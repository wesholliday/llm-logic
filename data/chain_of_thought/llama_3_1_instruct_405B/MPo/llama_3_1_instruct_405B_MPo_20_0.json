            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The banana was yellow' from the given statements, we need to examine the logical structure of the statements. The first statement, 'The apple was red', is a simple assertion. The second statement, 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow', is a conditional statement that connects the color of the apple with the color of the banana. In logic, the form of this argument is known as modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus ponens has the form: 'P', 'If P then Q', therefore 'Q'. Here, 'P' is 'The apple was red', and 'Q' is 'The banana was yellow'. Given that the premises match this form, we can logically infer the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
