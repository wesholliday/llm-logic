            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a modus ponens argument in logic. Modus ponens is a rule of inference that states if we have \"If P, then Q\" and we also have P, we can infer Q. In this case, \"P\" is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \"Q\" is \"Sue was at the wedding\". Given that we have both the premise that Mary was at the wedding and the conditional statement that if Mary was at the wedding then Sue was at the wedding, we can logically conclude that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
