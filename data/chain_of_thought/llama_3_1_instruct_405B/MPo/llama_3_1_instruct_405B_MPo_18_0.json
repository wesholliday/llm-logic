            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The truck was metal' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements. The first statement, 'The doll was plastic', is a simple assertion. The second statement, 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal', is a conditional statement that connects the material of the doll to the material of the truck. In logic, the form of this argument is known as modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus ponens has the form: 'P', 'If P then Q', therefore 'Q'. Here, 'P' is 'The doll was plastic', and 'Q' is 'The truck was metal'. Given that we have 'P' (The doll was plastic) and 'If P then Q' (If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal), we can logically conclude 'Q' (The truck was metal).\n\nAnswer: yes",
