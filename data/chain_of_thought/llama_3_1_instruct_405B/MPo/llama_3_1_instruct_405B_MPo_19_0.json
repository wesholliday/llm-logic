            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Jen watched basketball' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements. The first statement is a simple assertion: 'Tom watched football'. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball'. This conditional statement follows a basic form of logic known as modus ponens, which states that if we have 'If A, then B' and we know A is true, we can conclude B is true. Here, 'A' is 'Tom watched football', and 'B' is 'Jen watched basketball'. Since we are given that Tom watched football (A is true), we can use the conditional statement to infer that Jen watched basketball (B is true).\n\nAnswer: yes",
