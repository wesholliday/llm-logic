            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The book is a mystery novel' from the given statements, let's analyze the information step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is 'The book was written by James'. This statement provides direct information about the author of the book.\n\n2. The second statement is 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel'. This is a conditional statement that connects the authorship of the book to its genre. It implies that if James is the author, then the book must be a mystery novel.\n\n3. Combining these two statements, we have both the condition (the book was written by James) and the consequence of that condition (then the book is a mystery novel). Since the condition is met (the book was indeed written by James), we can logically conclude that the consequence must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the rules of logical inference, specifically modus ponens (which states that if we have 'If P then Q' and 'P', we can conclude 'Q'), we can infer 'The book is a mystery novel' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
