            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The mummy was awake' from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step. The first statement is 'The vampire was awake', which is a straightforward assertion. The second statement is 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake', which is a conditional statement that connects the state of the vampire to the state of the mummy. \n\nIn logical terms, the first statement is a premise (P), and the second statement is a conditional statement (if P, then Q). When we have a conditional statement and the premise of that statement is asserted as true, we can logically conclude the consequence (Q) of the conditional statement is also true. \n\nTherefore, since we know the vampire was awake (P), and we are told if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (if P, then Q), we can logically infer that the mummy was awake (Q).\n\nAnswer: yes",
