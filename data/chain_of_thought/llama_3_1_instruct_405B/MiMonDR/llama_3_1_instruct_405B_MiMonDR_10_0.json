            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The computer might be working or broken' from 'The computer might be broken', let's break down the meaning of both statements. 'The computer might be broken' implies that there is a possibility that the computer is not functioning properly, but it does not rule out the possibility that it might still be working. 'The computer might be working or broken' explicitly states both possibilities - that the computer could either be functioning or not functioning.\n\nGiven that 'The computer might be broken' acknowledges a possibility without excluding the other, it inherently implies that the computer could also be working. This is because saying something \"might\" be the case typically acknowledges uncertainty, which leaves room for the opposite scenario to also be possible.\n\nTherefore, the statement 'The computer might be working or broken' is essentially a more explicit version of the implications already present in 'The computer might be broken'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
