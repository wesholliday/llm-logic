            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The document must have been signed or notarized' implies that there are two possible conditions for the document to be valid: either it was signed, or it was notarized. The use of 'or' indicates that these conditions are alternatives, and only one of them needs to be met for the statement to be true. Therefore, we cannot infer that the document must have been notarized, as signing it would also satisfy the condition.\n\nAnswer: no",
