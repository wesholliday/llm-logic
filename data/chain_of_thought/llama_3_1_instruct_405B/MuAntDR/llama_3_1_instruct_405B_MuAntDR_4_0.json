            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The meeting must have been at 2 PM or cancelled' implies that there are two possible scenarios for the meeting: it either took place at 2 PM or it was cancelled. The use of 'or' indicates that both options are considered possible outcomes. Inferring 'The meeting must have been cancelled' from the original statement would mean eliminating the possibility of the meeting having taken place at 2 PM without any additional information to support this conclusion. Since the original statement presents both options as viable, we cannot logically infer that the meeting must have been cancelled without further evidence.\n\nAnswer: no",
