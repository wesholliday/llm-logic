The use of 'or' indicates that these outcomes are alternatives, and the statement does not provide any information that would allow us to conclude that one outcome is more likely than the other. Therefore, we cannot infer that the project must have been extended, as it is also possible that it was completed by Friday.\n\nAnswer: no",
