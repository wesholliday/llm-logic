The original statement is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\" This can be represented in a conditional form as \"If A, then not B,\" where A is \"Joe went to the park\" and B is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" \n\nThe statement we are trying to infer is \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park,\" which can be represented as \"If B, then not A.\" \n\nIn logic, the original statement \"If A, then not B\" is equivalent to saying \"If B, then not A\" through the principle of contrapositive inference. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo,\" we can logically infer \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\" because the latter is the contrapositive of the former.\n\nAnswer: yes",
