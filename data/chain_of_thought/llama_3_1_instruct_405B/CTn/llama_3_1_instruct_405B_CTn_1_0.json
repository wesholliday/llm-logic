            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, let's analyze the given statement logically. The original statement is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\" This can be represented in a conditional form as \"If M, then not S\" where M represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe statement we are trying to infer is \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding,\" which can be represented as \"If S, then not M.\"\n\nIn logic, the original statement implies that the presence of Mary (M) is sufficient to conclude the absence of Sue (not S). However, it does not directly state what we can conclude from the presence of Sue (S). The inference we are examining essentially reverses the roles of M and S and also negates them, which is a form of contrapositive reasoning.\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A,\" and it is logically equivalent to the original statement. Applying this to our original statement, \"If M, then not S\" implies its contrapositive, which is \"If S, then not M.\" This matches the statement we are trying to infer.\n\nTherefore, through contrapositive reasoning, we can logically infer \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
