            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, let's analyze the given statement logically. The original statement is \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was not metal.\" This can be represented in a conditional form as \"If P, then not M,\" where P stands for \"the doll was plastic\" and M stands for \"the truck was metal.\" \n\nIn logical terms, this statement only guarantees that if the doll is indeed plastic, the truck cannot be metal. However, it does not directly address the scenario where the truck is metal; it only implies what must be the case if the doll is plastic.\n\nThe statement we are asked to infer is \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic.\" This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then not M\" is \"If M, then not P,\" which directly matches the statement we are asked to infer.\n\nTherefore, through the principle of contrapositive inference in logic, we can indeed infer \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic\" from the original statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was not metal.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
