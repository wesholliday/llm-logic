            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, let's analyze the given statement logically. The original statement is \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\" This can be represented in a conditional form as \"If P, then not Q,\" where P represents \"Sam took a plane\" and Q represents \"Erin took a train.\"\n\nThe statement we are trying to infer is \"If Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane,\" which can be represented as \"If Q, then not P.\" This is the contrapositive form of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" However, the form we are examining is \"If Q, then not P,\" which is actually the inverse of the original statement, not the contrapositive.\n\nDespite the confusion in the explanation regarding contrapositive and inverse, the correct relationship to examine here is that the original statement and the one we are trying to infer are logically equivalent through contraposition when considering the original statement as \"If P, then not Q.\" The correct contrapositive would indeed be \"If Q, then not P,\" which matches the form of the statement we are trying to infer.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer \"If Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane\" from \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin did not take a train\" because they are logically equivalent statements when considering the correct application of contrapositive reasoning.\n\nAnswer: yes",
