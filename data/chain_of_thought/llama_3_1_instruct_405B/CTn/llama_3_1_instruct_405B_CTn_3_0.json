            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statement and the statement we're trying to infer into logical notation. The original statement is \"If the book was written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\" We can represent this as \"J \u2192 \u00acM\", where J stands for \"the book was written by James\" and M stands for \"the book is a mystery novel\". The statement we're trying to infer is \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James,\" which can be represented as \"M \u2192 \u00acJ\".\n\nIn logic, the original statement \"J \u2192 \u00acM\" is equivalent to \"\u00ac\u00acJ \u2192 \u00acM\" by double negation, and then further equivalent to \"M \u2192 \u00acJ\" by contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning they have the same truth value in all possible worlds.\n\nTherefore, from \"If the book was written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel,\" we can logically infer \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
