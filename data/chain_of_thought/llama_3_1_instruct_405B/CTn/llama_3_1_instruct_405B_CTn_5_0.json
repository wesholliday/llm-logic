            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, let's analyze the logical structure of both statements. The first statement is of the form \"If A, then not B\" (If Jeff played basketball, then Amy did not play tennis). This implies that the occurrence of A (Jeff playing basketball) negates the occurrence of B (Amy playing tennis). \n\nThe second statement is of the form \"If B, then not A\" (If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball). This statement essentially reverses the conditions of the first statement but maintains the same logical relationship between the actions of Jeff and Amy. \n\nIn formal logic, the rule of contrapositive states that from \"If A, then B,\" we can infer \"If not B, then not A.\" Applying this rule to the original statement, we can infer \"If Amy played tennis (not B), then Jeff did not play basketball (not A).\" \n\nTherefore, the second statement is logically equivalent to the first statement by the principle of contrapositive inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
