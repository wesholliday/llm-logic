            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, let's analyze the given statement logically. The original statement is \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.\" This can be represented in a conditional form as \"Bear in cave \u2192 Wolf not in den.\" \n\nIn logic, the form of the given statement is \"If P, then Q\" or \"P \u2192 Q,\" where P is \"the bear was in the cave\" and Q is \"the wolf was not in the den.\" The statement we are asked to infer is \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave,\" which can be logically represented as \"Wolf in den \u2192 Bear not in cave.\"\n\nThis second statement is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"P \u2192 Q\" is \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP,\" where \u00ac means \"not.\" The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave\" from \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
