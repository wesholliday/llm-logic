            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, let's analyze the logical structure of the statements. The first statement is of the form \"If A, then not B\" (If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow). The second statement is of the form \"If B, then not A\" (If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red). In logical terms, the first statement can be represented as A \u2192 \u00acB, where \"\u00ac\" denotes negation. The second statement can be represented as B \u2192 \u00acA. \n\nThe process of inferring the second statement from the first is equivalent to checking if the contrapositive of the first statement is logically equivalent to the second statement. The contrapositive of a statement A \u2192 B is \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA. Therefore, the contrapositive of A \u2192 \u00acB is \u00ac(\u00acB) \u2192 \u00acA, which simplifies to B \u2192 \u00acA. This matches the form of the second statement. \n\nSince the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red\" from \"If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
