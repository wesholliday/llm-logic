            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, let's analyze the given statement logically. The original statement is \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\" This can be represented in a conditional form as \"Sue chose pizza \u2192 Bob did not choose pasta.\" \n\nIn logic, the form of the original statement is \"p \u2192 \u00acq\" (if p, then not q), where p is \"Sue chose pizza\" and q is \"Bob chose pasta.\" The statement we are trying to infer is \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza,\" which can be logically represented as \"q \u2192 \u00acp\" (if q, then not p).\n\nThe process of inferring \"q \u2192 \u00acp\" from \"p \u2192 \u00acq\" is logically valid because it is essentially the contrapositive form of the original statement. The contrapositive of a statement \"p \u2192 q\" is \"\u00acq \u2192 \u00acp,\" and it is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, given \"p \u2192 \u00acq,\" we can logically infer \"q \u2192 \u00acp\" because if the presence of p implies the absence of q, then the presence of q must imply the absence of p.\n\nAnswer: yes",
