            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, let's analyze the given statement logically. The original statement is \"If the car was red, then the truck was not blue.\" This can be represented in a conditional form as \"If A, then not B,\" where A represents \"the car was red\" and B represents \"the truck was blue.\" \n\nIn logical terms, \"If A, then not B\" is equivalent to saying \"If B, then not A.\" This is because both statements convey that A and B cannot be true at the same time, establishing a relationship of mutual exclusivity between the conditions of the car being red and the truck being blue.\n\nTherefore, given the original statement, it logically follows that if the truck was indeed blue (B is true), then the car could not have been red (A is not true), because the truth of one condition necessitates the falsity of the other according to the given conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
