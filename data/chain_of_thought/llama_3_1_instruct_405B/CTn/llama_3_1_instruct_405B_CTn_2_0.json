            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statement into a logical form. The original statement is \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\" This can be represented as \"G \u2192 \u00acU\", where G represents \"the griffin was in the forest\" and U represents \"the unicorn was in the forest\". The statement we are trying to infer is \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest,\" which can be represented as \"U \u2192 \u00acG\".\n\nIn classical logic, the original statement \"G \u2192 \u00acU\" is logically equivalent to \"\u00ac\u00acG \u2192 \u00acU\" (double negation law), which simplifies to \"G \u2192 \u00acU\". However, the statement we are trying to infer, \"U \u2192 \u00acG\", is the contrapositive of \"G \u2192 \u00acU\". The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"G \u2192 \u00acU\" is indeed \"\u00ac\u00acU \u2192 \u00acG\", which simplifies to \"U \u2192 \u00acG\".\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
