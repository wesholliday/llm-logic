            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, let's analyze the logical structure of the statements. The first statement is of the form \"If A, then not B,\" which can be symbolically represented as A \u2192 \u00acB. The second statement is of the form \"If B, then not A,\" which can be symbolically represented as B \u2192 \u00acA. In classical logic, the statement A \u2192 \u00acB is logically equivalent to B \u2192 \u00acA. This equivalence is known as the contrapositive form. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning they have the same truth conditions. Therefore, if the first statement is true, the second statement must also be true because they are contrapositives of each other.\n\nAnswer: yes",
