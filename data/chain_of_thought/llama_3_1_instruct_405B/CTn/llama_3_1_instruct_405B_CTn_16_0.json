            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, let's analyze the given statement logically. The original statement is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim.\" This can be represented in a conditional form as \"If A, then not B,\" where A represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and B represents \"the pants were denim.\"\n\nIn logical terms, \"If A, then not B\" is equivalent to saying \"If B, then not A.\" This is because both statements convey that A and B cannot be true at the same time. The first statement implies that the presence of A (cotton shirt) means the absence of B (denim pants), and the logically equivalent statement implies that the presence of B (denim pants) means the absence of A (cotton shirt).\n\nTherefore, from \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim,\" we can logically infer \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton,\" as both statements are logically equivalent and convey the mutual exclusivity of A and B under the given condition.\n\nAnswer: yes",
