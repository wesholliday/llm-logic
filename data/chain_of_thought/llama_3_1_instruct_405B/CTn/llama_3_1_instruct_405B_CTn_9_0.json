            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements. The first statement is of the form \"If A, then not B\" (If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt). The second statement is of the form \"If B, then not A\" (If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt). In logic, the statement \"If A, then not B\" is equivalent to \"If B, then not A\" through the principle of contrapositive inference. This principle states that if A implies not B, then B implies not A. Therefore, we can logically infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
