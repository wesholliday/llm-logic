            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, let's analyze the given statement logically. The original statement is \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\" This can be represented in a conditional form as \"If A, then not B,\" where A represents \"the cake was chocolate\" and B represents \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nThe statement we are trying to infer is \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate,\" which can be represented as \"If B, then not A.\"\n\nIn logic, the original statement \"If A, then not B\" is equivalent to saying \"If B, then not A\" through a process called contrapositive inference. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, from \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry,\" we can logically infer \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\" because the latter is the contrapositive of the former.\n\nAnswer: yes",
