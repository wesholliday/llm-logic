            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, let's analyze the given statement logically. The original statement is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was not awake.\" This can be represented in a conditional form as \"V \u2192 \u00acM\" where V represents \"the vampire was awake\" and M represents \"the mummy was awake.\" The statement we are trying to infer is \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake,\" which can be represented as \"M \u2192 \u00acV.\"\n\nIn classical logic, the original statement does not directly imply the second statement because the original statement only specifies what happens when the vampire is awake (it tells us the mummy is not awake in that case). It does not provide information about the state of the vampire when the mummy is awake. However, in many contexts, especially in everyday reasoning, people might intuitively accept the contrapositive inference (\"If A then B\" implies \"If not B then not A\"), which is logically valid.\n\nThe contrapositive of \"V \u2192 \u00acM\" is indeed \"M \u2192 \u00acV,\" because if the presence of V implies the absence of M, logically, the presence of M would imply the absence of V. This is based on the principle of contrapositive inference in logic, which states that a conditional statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive.\n\nTherefore, logically, we can infer \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake\" from the given statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was not awake.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
