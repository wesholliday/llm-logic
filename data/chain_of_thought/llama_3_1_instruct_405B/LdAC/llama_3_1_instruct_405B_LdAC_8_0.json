            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a conditional statement (\"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\") and a categorical statement (\"The mummy was awake\"). The conditional statement only guarantees that if the vampire is awake, the mummy will be awake, but it does not guarantee the reverse: that if the mummy is awake, the vampire must be awake. There could be other reasons the mummy is awake that do not involve the vampire being awake. Therefore, from these statements alone, we cannot logically deduce that the vampire was awake simply because the mummy was awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
