            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into logical expressions. Let M represent \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S represent \"Sue was at the wedding\". The first statement, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" can be represented as M \u2192 S. The second statement, \"Sue was at the wedding,\" is simply S.\n\nGiven these, we're trying to deduce M (Mary was at the wedding).\n\nThe logical rule given by M \u2192 S means that if M is true, then S must be true. However, it does not imply that if S is true, M must be true. There could be many reasons S is true (Sue was at the wedding) that do not involve M (Mary being at the wedding).\n\nFor example, Sue could have been at the wedding because she was invited independently of Mary, or for any number of reasons not related to Mary's presence.\n\nTherefore, knowing S (Sue was at the wedding) does not allow us to deduce M (Mary was at the wedding) logically from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
