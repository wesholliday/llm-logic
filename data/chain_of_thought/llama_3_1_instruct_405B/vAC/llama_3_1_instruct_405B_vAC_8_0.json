            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument's form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Q\n3. Therefore, P\n\nWhere P represents \"the vampire was awake\" and Q represents \"the mummy was awake\". \n\nThis form of argument is known as affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy. Just because the mummy was awake (Q is true), it doesn't necessarily mean that the vampire was awake (P is true). There could be other reasons why the mummy was awake that have nothing to do with the vampire's state. The first premise only guarantees that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would be awake, but it does not guarantee the reverse: that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire must have been awake.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises, making the argument invalid.\n\nAnswer: no",
