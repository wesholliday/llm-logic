The argument's form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Q\n3. Therefore, P\n\nWhere P represents \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q represents \"the muffins were blueberry\". \n\nThis form of argument is known as affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy. Just because the muffins were blueberry (Q is true), it doesn't necessarily mean that the cake was chocolate (P is true). There could be other reasons why the muffins were blueberry that have nothing to do with the cake being chocolate. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
