The argument's form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Q\n3. Therefore, P\n\nWhere P represents \"the apple was red\" and Q represents \"the banana was yellow\". \n\nThis form of argument is known as affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy. Just because Q (the banana was yellow) is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that P (the apple was red) is true. There could be other reasons why the banana was yellow that have nothing to do with the color of the apple. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
