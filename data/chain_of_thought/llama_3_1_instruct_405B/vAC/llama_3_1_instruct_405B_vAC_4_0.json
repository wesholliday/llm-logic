The argument's form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If A, then B\n2. B\n3. Therefore, A\n\nWhere A is \"the alien visited Mars\" and B is \"the robot visited Jupiter\". \n\nThis form of argument is known as affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy. Just because B is true, it doesn't necessarily mean A is true. There could be other reasons why B is true that have nothing to do with A. In this case, the robot visiting Jupiter does not necessarily mean the alien visited Mars, as there is no direct causal link or logical necessity connecting the two events in such a way that would make the conclusion follow necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
