The argument's form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Q\n3. Therefore, P\n\nWhere P represents \"the griffin was in the forest\" and Q represents \"the unicorn was in the forest\".\n\nThis form of argument is known as affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy. Just because Q is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that P is true. There could be other reasons why Q is true that have nothing to do with P. In this case, the presence of the unicorn in the forest does not necessarily imply the presence of the griffin.\n\nAnswer: no",
