The argument's form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Q\n3. Therefore, P\n\nWhere P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel\".\n\nThis form of argument is known as affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy. Just because Q is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that P is the only condition that leads to Q, or that P is true at all. There could be other reasons why the book is a mystery novel (Q) that have nothing to do with it being written by James (P).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises, making the argument invalid.\n\nAnswer: no",
