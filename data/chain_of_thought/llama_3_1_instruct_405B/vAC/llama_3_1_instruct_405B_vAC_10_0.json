The argument's form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Q\n3. Therefore, P\n\nWhere P represents \"the dog was inside\" and Q represents \"the cat was outside\".\n\nIn logic, this form of argument is known as affirming the consequent, which is a fallacy. Just because Q is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that P is true. There could be other reasons why Q is true that have nothing to do with P. For example, the cat could have been outside for reasons unrelated to the dog's location.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises, making the argument invalid.\n\nAnswer: no",
