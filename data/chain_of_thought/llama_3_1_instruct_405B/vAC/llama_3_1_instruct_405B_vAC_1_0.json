            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument's form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Q\n3. Therefore, P\n\nWhere P represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q represents \"Sue was at the wedding\".\n\nIn this form, the argument is attempting to conclude P (Mary was at the wedding) based on the premises that if P then Q (if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding) and Q (Sue was at the wedding). However, the presence of Sue at the wedding (Q) does not necessarily imply that Mary was at the wedding (P) because the first premise only guarantees Sue's presence if Mary is there, not the other way around. Sue could be at the wedding for reasons unrelated to Mary's presence.\n\nThis type of argument is known as affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy. It incorrectly assumes that because the consequent (Q) is true, the antecedent (P) must also be true, which does not logically follow from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
