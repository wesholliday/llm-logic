            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The contract must have been approved by the legal team or the CEO\" implies that there are two possible entities that can approve the contract: the legal team or the CEO. It does not explicitly state that these are mutually exclusive options, but in the context of logical disjunction (\"or\"), we can infer that at least one of these conditions must be met for the contract to be considered approved.\n\nBreaking down the original statement into its components, we have two conditions: \n1. The contract must have been approved by the legal team.\n2. The contract must have been approved by the CEO.\n\nThe \"or\" in the original statement indicates that if either of these conditions is true, then the contract is considered approved. Therefore, it logically follows that \"The contract must have been approved by the legal team or it must have been approved by the CEO\" is an equivalent way of expressing the original statement, emphasizing that at least one of the approval conditions must be met.\n\nAnswer: yes",
