            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The software must have been installed on the computer or accessed through the cloud\" implies that there are two possible scenarios for the software's usage: it was either installed on the computer or accessed through the cloud. The use of \"or\" suggests an inclusive disjunction, meaning that at least one of the conditions must be true. However, the original statement does not explicitly rule out the possibility that both conditions could be true simultaneously (e.g., the software was installed but also has cloud-accessible features).\n\nWhen we rephrase it to \"The software must have been installed on the computer or it must have been accessed through the cloud,\" the addition of \"it must have been\" before the second option could be interpreted as emphasizing that each option is a distinct requirement, potentially leading to an exclusive interpretation where only one can be true. However, this rephrased statement still fundamentally conveys the same inclusive disjunction as the original statement, given that \"or\" typically allows for the possibility of both conditions being true unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n\nTherefore, the inference from the original statement to the rephrased statement is generally valid in terms of logical meaning, though the rephrased statement might slightly alter the emphasis or interpretation of exclusivity.\n\nAnswer: yes",
