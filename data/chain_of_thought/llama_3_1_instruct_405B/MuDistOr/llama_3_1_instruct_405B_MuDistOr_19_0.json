            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The candidate must have had a degree or relevant work experience\" implies that there are two alternatives for the candidate to meet the requirement: either having a degree or having relevant work experience. This is an inclusive disjunction, where at least one of the conditions needs to be met. The rephrased statement \"The candidate must have had a degree or they must have had relevant work experience\" explicitly separates the two alternatives with the same implication, meaning that the candidate needs to fulfill at least one of these conditions. Therefore, the rephrased statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
