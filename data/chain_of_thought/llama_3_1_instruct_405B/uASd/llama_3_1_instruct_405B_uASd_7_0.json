            "content": "Explanation: To answer this question, we need to examine the given statement and its conditions. The original statement is \"If the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm.\" This statement establishes a direct relationship between the oven being on and the kitchen's warmth. The presence or absence of the pilot light is not mentioned as a condition affecting the kitchen's temperature in this context. Therefore, the condition of the pilot light (whether it is on or out) does not directly impact the original statement's logic about the oven's effect on the kitchen's warmth. Since the primary condition (the oven being on) for the kitchen to be warm is met, the additional information about the pilot light being out does not negate the original statement's conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
