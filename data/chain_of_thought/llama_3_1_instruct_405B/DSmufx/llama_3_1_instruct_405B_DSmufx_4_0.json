The first statement is \"Either the fribble must be crinked or it is snurgled.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true. It can be represented logically as: (Fribble must be crinked) OR (Fribble is snurgled).\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked.\" This statement negates the necessity of the fribble being crinked. It can be represented logically as: NOT (Fribble must be crinked).\n\n3. Combining these two statements, we can infer that since it's not necessary for the fribble to be crinked, and one of the two conditions must be true, then the fribble being snurgled becomes the condition that must be true for the initial disjunction to hold.\n\nTherefore, logically, if it's not the case that the fribble must be crinked, and one of the conditions must be true, we can conclude that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
