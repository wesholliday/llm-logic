            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into logical expressions. Let's denote \"the splat must be quanked\" as Q and \"the splat is morphed\" as M. The first statement, \"Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed,\" can be represented as Q \u2228 M (where \u2228 denotes \"or\"). The second statement, \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked,\" can be represented as \u00acQ (where \u00ac denotes \"not\").\n\nGiven these representations, we can apply basic rules of logic to infer the conclusion. The first statement gives us two possibilities: the splat must be quanked or it is morphed. The second statement eliminates the first possibility, stating that it's not the case that the splat must be quanked.\n\nTherefore, if we have Q \u2228 M and we know \u00acQ, we can conclude M by the rule of disjunctive syllogism, which states that if one of the disjuncts (options) in an \"or\" statement is false, the other disjunct must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
