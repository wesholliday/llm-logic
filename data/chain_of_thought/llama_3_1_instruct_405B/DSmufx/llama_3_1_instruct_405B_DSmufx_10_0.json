The first statement is \"Either the wug must be garpled or it is sproinged.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two options must be true. It can be represented logically as: (Wug must be garpled) \u2228 (Wug is sproinged).\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the wug must be garpled.\" This is the negation of the first option in the disjunction. It can be represented logically as: \u00ac(Wug must be garpled).\n\n3. When we have a disjunction and one of the options is negated, we can infer that the other option must be true if the disjunction itself is true. This is because for the disjunction to hold, at least one of the options must be true. If one option is negated, the other must be the case for the disjunction to remain true.\n\n4. Therefore, given that it's not the case that the wug must be garpled, we can infer from the initial disjunction that the wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
