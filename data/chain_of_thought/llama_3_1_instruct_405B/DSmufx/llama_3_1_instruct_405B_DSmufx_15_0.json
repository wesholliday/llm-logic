            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into logical expressions. Let's denote \"the dreb must be spened\" as S and \"the dreb is vroombed\" as V. The first statement is \"Either the dreb must be spened or it is vroombed,\" which can be expressed as S \u2228 V (S or V). The second statement is \"It's not the case that the dreb must be spened,\" which can be expressed as \u00acS (not S).\n\nGiven these expressions, we can apply basic rules of logic to infer the conclusion. The rule that applies here is disjunctive syllogism, which states that if we have S \u2228 V and \u00acS, we can conclude V.\n\nStarting with S \u2228 V (Either the dreb must be spened or it is vroombed) and given \u00acS (It's not the case that the dreb must be spened), by applying disjunctive syllogism, we can conclude V (The dreb is vroombed).\n\nAnswer: yes",
