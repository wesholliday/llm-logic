The first statement is \"Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two options must be true. It can be represented logically as: Z \u2228 B, where Z represents \"the flugel must be zargled\" and B represents \"the flugel is blimmed.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled.\" This is a negation of the first option in the disjunction, which can be represented logically as: \u00acZ.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can apply the rule of disjunctive syllogism, which states that if we have a disjunction (Z \u2228 B) and the negation of one of the disjuncts (\u00acZ), we can infer the other disjunct (B).\n\nTherefore, by applying this rule, we can infer from the given statements that \"The flugel is blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
