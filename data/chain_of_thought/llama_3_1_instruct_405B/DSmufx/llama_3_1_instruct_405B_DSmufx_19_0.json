The first statement is \"Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two options must be true. It can be represented logically as: P \u2228 V, where P stands for \"the smonk must be plagged\" and V stands for \"the smonk is vreebled.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged.\" This is the negation of the first option in the disjunction, which can be represented logically as: \u00acP.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can apply the rule of disjunctive syllogism, which states that if we have P \u2228 Q and \u00acP, we can infer Q.\n\nApplying this rule to our statements:\n\n- We have P \u2228 V (Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled)\n- And we have \u00acP (It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged)\n\nTherefore, we can infer V, which means \"The smonk is vreebled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
