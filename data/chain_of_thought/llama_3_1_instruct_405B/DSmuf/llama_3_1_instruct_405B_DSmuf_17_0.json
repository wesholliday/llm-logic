            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into logical expressions. Let's denote \"the scarf must be draped on the coat rack\" as P and \"the scarf is stuffed in my backpack\" as Q. The first statement is \"Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack,\" which can be expressed as P \u2228 Q (P or Q). The second statement is \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack,\" which can be expressed as \u00acP (not P).\n\nGiven these expressions, we can apply basic rules of logic to infer the conclusion. The rule that applies here is disjunctive syllogism, which states that if we have P \u2228 Q and \u00acP, we can conclude Q.\n\nApplying this rule:\n\n1. We have P \u2228 Q (Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack).\n2. We also have \u00acP (It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack).\n\nUsing disjunctive syllogism, we can conclude Q, which means \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
