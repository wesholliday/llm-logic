            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The snork might be in the wibble or on the quank' implies that there are two possible locations for the snork: in the wibble or on the quank. The use of 'or' suggests that these are alternatives. When we rephrase this as 'The snork might be in the wibble or it might be on the quank', we are essentially making explicit the possibility that was already implied in the original statement. The addition of 'it might be' after the 'or' does not change the meaning but rather clarifies that each option is a separate possibility. Therefore, the rephrased statement is a logical inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
