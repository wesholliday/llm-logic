            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The wibble might be on the zizz or in the snizzle\" implies that there are two possible locations for the wibble: on the zizz or in the snizzle. The use of \"or\" suggests that these are alternative possibilities. When we rephrase this statement as \"The wibble might be on the zizz or it might be in the snizzle\", we are essentially making the alternatives explicit by repeating the modal verb \"might\" for each option. This rephrased statement does not change the meaning of the original statement; it merely clarifies the alternatives by making them more explicit. Therefore, the rephrased statement is a logical inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
