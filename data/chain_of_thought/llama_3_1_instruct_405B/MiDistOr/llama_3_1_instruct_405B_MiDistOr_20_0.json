            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The event might be formal or semi-formal' uses 'or' to present two possibilities for the nature of the event. This construction implies that there are two distinct options being considered: the event being formal and the event being semi-formal. The use of 'or' in this context is inclusive, meaning it is presenting a range of possibilities without excluding either one. Therefore, it logically follows that if the event might be formal or semi-formal, it indeed might be formal or it might be semi-formal, as these are the two options explicitly presented.\n\nAnswer: yes",
