            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The flight might be delayed or on time' uses 'or' to present two possibilities regarding the status of the flight. When we say 'The flight might be delayed or on time', the 'might' applies to both possibilities because of the way 'or' functions in English, distributing the possibility to both options. \n\nTherefore, when we rephrase it as 'The flight might be delayed or it might be on time', we are explicitly stating the 'might' for each option, which is logically equivalent to the original statement. This rephrased statement simply clarifies that 'might' applies to both being delayed and being on time, which is the intended meaning of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
