            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The document might be signed or notarized\" can be interpreted in two ways: either as offering alternatives where 'or' is exclusive (meaning it could be one or the other but not both), or as inclusive (meaning it could be one, the other, or both). However, the structure of the sentence leans more towards an inclusive interpretation because in legal or formal contexts, documents can indeed be both signed and notarized. The inferred statement \"The document might be signed or it might be notarized\" explicitly presents these as separate possibilities, which aligns with the inclusive interpretation of the original statement. Therefore, the inference seems logically sound.\n\nAnswer: yes",
