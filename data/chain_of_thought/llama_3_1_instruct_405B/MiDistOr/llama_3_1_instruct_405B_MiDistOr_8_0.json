            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The restaurant might be closed on Mondays or open for limited hours' implies two possibilities about the restaurant's status on Mondays: it could either be closed or have limited hours. The use of 'or' in this context presents these as alternative scenarios that might occur. When rephrasing this statement to 'The restaurant might be closed on Mondays or it might be open for limited hours', we are essentially maintaining the same meaning and presenting the same two possibilities. The addition of 'it might be' after 'or' does not change the underlying implication of uncertainty regarding the restaurant's hours on Mondays; it merely makes each possibility more explicit by repeating the modal verb 'might' for each scenario. Therefore, the rephrased statement is a logical inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
