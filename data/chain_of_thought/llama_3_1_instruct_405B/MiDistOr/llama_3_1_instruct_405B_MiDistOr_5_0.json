            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The package might be delivered today or tomorrow' implies that there are two possible days for the delivery of the package: today and tomorrow. The use of 'or' in this context suggests an inclusive disjunction, where the possibility of delivery is open for both days mentioned. \n\nWhen we break it down to 'The package might be delivered today or it might be delivered tomorrow', we are essentially making explicit the possibility that exists for each day separately. This rephrased statement maintains the same meaning as the original statement, emphasizing that there is a possibility of delivery on either of the two days. \n\nThe rephrased statement does not introduce any new information nor does it alter the meaning of the original statement; it merely elaborates on the existing possibilities. Therefore, the inference from the original statement to the rephrased statement is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
