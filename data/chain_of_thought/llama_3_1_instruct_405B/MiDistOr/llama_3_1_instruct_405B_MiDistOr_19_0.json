            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The application might be completed online or in person\" uses the word \"or\" to present two alternatives for completing the application. This construction implies that there are two separate possibilities: one where the application is completed online and another where it is completed in person. The use of \"or\" suggests a choice between these two options, which is equivalent to saying \"The application might be completed online or it might be completed in person.\" This rephrased statement explicitly separates the two possibilities into distinct clauses, but the meaning remains the same as the original statement. The rephrased statement is essentially an expansion of the original, making the alternatives clearer without changing the underlying message.\n\nAnswer: yes",
