Considering Premise 2, in a disjunction (Q \u2228 M), if one disjunct (Q in this case) is false, the truth of the entire disjunction depends on the truth of the other disjunct (M). Since we are given that Q is false, for the disjunction Q \u2228 M to be true, M must be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can logically infer that \"The splat is morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
