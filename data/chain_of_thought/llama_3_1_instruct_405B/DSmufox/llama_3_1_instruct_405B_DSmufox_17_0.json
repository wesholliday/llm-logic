The first statement is \"It's not the case that the flob must be movated.\" This can be translated into a logical statement as \u00ac(the flob must be movated), where \u00ac denotes negation. This means that there is no necessity for the flob to be movated.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled.\" This can be translated into a logical statement as (the flob must be movated) \u2228 (the flob is skizzled), where \u2228 denotes disjunction (or).\n\nGiven these two statements, we can apply logical rules to see if we can infer \"The flob is skizzled.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that it's not necessary for the flob to be movated. When we combine this with the second statement, which gives us two possibilities (the flob must be movated or it is skizzled), the negation of the necessity for the flob to be movated leads us to consider the alternative provided by the disjunction.\n\nIn classical logic, from \u00acA and A \u2228 B, we can infer B through the process of disjunctive syllogism. Here, A is \"the flob must be movated,\" and B is \"the flob is skizzled.\" Since we have \u00acA (it's not the case that the flob must be movated) and A \u2228 B (either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled), we can infer B (the flob is skizzled).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and applying the rules of classical logic, we can infer that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
