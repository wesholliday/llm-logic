When we look at the second statement, which is a disjunction, for the whole statement to be true, at least one of the disjuncts must be true. Since we know from the first statement that \"the dreb must be spened\" is false, the only way for the disjunction to be true is if \"the dreb is vroombed\" is true.\n\nTherefore, logically, from the given statements, we can infer that \"The dreb is vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
