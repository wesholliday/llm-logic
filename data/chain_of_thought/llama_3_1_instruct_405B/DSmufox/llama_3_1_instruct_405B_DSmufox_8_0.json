            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements into logical components to analyze the inference.\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled\" can be translated into a logical statement as \u00ac(the sprocket must be daggled), where \"\u00ac\" denotes negation.\n\n2. \"Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked\" translates to (the sprocket must be daggled) \u2228 (the sprocket is cranked), where \"\u2228\" denotes disjunction (or).\n\nGiven these, we want to see if we can infer \"The sprocket is cranked.\"\n\nIn logical terms, we have:\n1. \u00ac(the sprocket must be daggled)\n2. (the sprocket must be daggled) \u2228 (the sprocket is cranked)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that \"the sprocket must be daggled\" is false. When we apply this to the disjunction in statement 2, since one of the disjuncts is false, for the entire disjunction to be true, the other disjunct must be true. Therefore, \"the sprocket is cranked\" must be true for the disjunction to hold true given the negation of the first disjunct.\n\nThis is a classic application of the disjunctive syllogism, which states that if one of the disjuncts in a disjunction is negated, the other disjunct must be true for the disjunction to be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
