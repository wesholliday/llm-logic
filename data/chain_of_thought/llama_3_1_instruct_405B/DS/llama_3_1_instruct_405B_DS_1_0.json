            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the information given into logical statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is \"Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden.\" This can be represented logically as \"Fido is inside OR Fido is in the garden,\" which is a classic example of an inclusive disjunction. In logic, for an inclusive disjunction to be true, at least one of the disjuncts must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Fido is not in the garden.\" This directly negates one of the disjuncts from the first statement.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can apply a logical rule known as disjunctive syllogism. Disjunctive syllogism states that if we have \"P or Q\" and \"not P,\" we can logically conclude \"Q.\" In this case, \"P\" would represent \"Fido is in the garden,\" and \"Q\" would represent \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nApplying disjunctive syllogism:\n- We have \"Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden\" (P or Q).\n- We also have \"Fido is not in the garden\" (not P).\n\nTherefore, we can logically conclude \"Fido is inside\" (Q).\n\nAnswer: yes",
