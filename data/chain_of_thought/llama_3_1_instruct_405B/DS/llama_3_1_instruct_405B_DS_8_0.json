            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the information given into logical statements and analyze the conclusion we can draw from them.\n\n1. The first statement is \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch.\" This can be represented logically as A or B, where A is \"the remote control is on the coffee table\" and B is \"it is hiding under the couch.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"The remote control isn't hiding under the couch,\" which directly negates B, leaving us with not B.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can apply a logical rule known as the disjunctive syllogism. The disjunctive syllogism states that if we have A or B, and we know that not B is true, we can conclude A. This is because in an \"or\" statement, only one of the conditions needs to be true for the whole statement to be true. If we eliminate one of the conditions (in this case, B), the remaining condition (A) must be true for the original statement to hold.\n\nTherefore, by applying the disjunctive syllogism to our statements, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table because we have eliminated the alternative (it hiding under the couch).\n\nAnswer: yes",
