            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the information given into logical statements. The first statement is \"Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table.\" This can be represented as A or B, where A is \"the book is on the shelf\" and B is \"it is resting on the table.\" The second statement is \"The book isn't resting on the table,\" which can be represented as not B. \n\nIn logic, when we have a statement that says A or B, and we find out that B is not true, we can conclude that A must be true because one of the options has to be true in an \"or\" scenario. Therefore, if we know the book isn't resting on the table (not B), we can infer from the first statement that the book is on the shelf (A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
