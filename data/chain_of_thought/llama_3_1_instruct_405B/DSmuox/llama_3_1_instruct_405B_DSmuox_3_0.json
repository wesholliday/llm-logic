If we let Q represent \"the splat must be quanked\", then this statement is simply \u00acQ.\n\n2. \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked\" can be represented as (the splat is morphed) \u2228 (the splat must be quanked), where \"\u2228\" denotes disjunction (or). If we let M represent \"the splat is morphed\", then this statement is M \u2228 Q.\n\nGiven these representations, we can examine the inference:\n\nFrom \u00acQ and M \u2228 Q, we want to determine if we can infer M (the splat is morphed).\n\nIn classical logic, the disjunctive syllogism rule states that from \u00acA and A \u2228 B, we can infer B. Applying this rule to our case:\n\n- We have \u00acQ (It's not the case that the splat must be quanked).\n- We have M \u2228 Q (Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked).\n\nBy disjunctive syllogism, since Q is negated, we can infer M (the splat is morphed).\n\nAnswer: yes",
