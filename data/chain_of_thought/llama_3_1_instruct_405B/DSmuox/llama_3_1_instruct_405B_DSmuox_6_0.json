This directly contradicts the second part of the disjunction in the second statement. \n\nIn the second statement, since it's a disjunction, if one part of the disjunction is false, and we know it is because of the first statement, then for the whole disjunction to be true, the other part must be true. \n\nTherefore, if \"the grommet must be plopped\" is false, then for the disjunction to hold true, \"the grommet is sploffed\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
