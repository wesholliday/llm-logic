If we let S represent \"the zinger must be smoogled,\" then this statement is \u00acS.\n\n2. \"Either the zinger is fraggled or it must be smoogled\" can be translated into (the zinger is fraggled) \u2228 (the zinger must be smoogled), where \u2228 denotes disjunction (or). If we let F represent \"the zinger is fraggled,\" then this statement is F \u2228 S.\n\nGiven these translations, we can examine the argument:\n\nPremise 1: \u00acS\nPremise 2: F \u2228 S\n\nFrom Premise 1, we know that S is false (it's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled). Looking at Premise 2, for the disjunction F \u2228 S to be true, at least one of the disjuncts must be true. Since S is false (from Premise 1), F must be true for the disjunction to hold.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can logically infer that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
