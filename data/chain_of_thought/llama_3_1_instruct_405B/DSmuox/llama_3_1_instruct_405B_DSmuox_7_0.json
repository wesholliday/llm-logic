When we look at the second statement, given that one of the disjuncts (\"the whiffle must be tinked\") is false, for the entire disjunction to be true, the other disjunct (\"the whiffle is shanked\") must be true. This is because in a logical disjunction, at least one of the disjuncts must be true for the whole statement to be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can logically infer that \"The whiffle is shanked\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
