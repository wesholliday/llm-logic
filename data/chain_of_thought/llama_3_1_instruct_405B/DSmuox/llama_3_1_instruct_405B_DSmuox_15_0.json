            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements into logical expressions to analyze the inference.\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the dreb must be spened\" can be translated into \u00ac(the dreb must be spened), where \"\u00ac\" denotes negation. If we let \"S\" represent \"the dreb must be spened,\" then this statement is \u00acS.\n\n2. \"Either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened\" can be translated into (the dreb is vroombed) \u2228 (the dreb must be spened), where \"\u2228\" denotes disjunction (or). If we let \"V\" represent \"the dreb is vroombed,\" then this statement is V \u2228 S.\n\nGiven these translations, we have two premises:\n- \u00acS (It's not the case that the dreb must be spened)\n- V \u2228 S (Either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened)\n\nTo infer \"The dreb is vroombed\" (V) from these premises, we can use the rule of disjunctive syllogism, which states that from \u00acA and A \u2228 B, we can infer B.\n\nApplying this rule to our premises:\n- We have \u00acS (negating one of the disjuncts in the second premise)\n- And we have V \u2228 S (the disjunction itself)\n\nTherefore, by disjunctive syllogism, we can infer V (The dreb is vroombed).\n\nAnswer: yes",
