This directly contradicts the second part of the disjunction in the second statement. \n\nIn classical logic, from a disjunction (A \u2228 B) and the negation of one of its disjuncts (\u00acA), we can infer the other disjunct (B). This is known as disjunctive syllogism.\n\nApplying this rule to our case:\n- We have the disjunction \"(the flob is skizzled) \u2228 (the flob must be movated)\".\n- And we have \"\u00ac(the flob must be movated)\" from the first statement.\n\nTherefore, by disjunctive syllogism, we can infer \"The flob is skizzled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
