            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step. The first statement, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding,\" establishes a conditional relationship where Mary's presence at the wedding necessitates Sue's presence. The second statement, \"Sue might not have been at the wedding,\" introduces uncertainty about Sue's attendance, implying that it's possible Sue was not there.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary could not have been there, because Mary's presence requires Sue's presence. However, the second statement does not definitively say Sue was not at the wedding; it only suggests the possibility that Sue might not have been there.\n\nGiven this, we cannot conclusively infer that Mary was not at the wedding based solely on the possibility that Sue might not have been there. The logic does not allow us to make a definitive conclusion about Mary's attendance without more information about Sue's actual attendance.\n\nAnswer: no",
