            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step. The first statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement that connects Lisa's action (buying the red shirt) directly to Mark's action (buying the blue shirt). It implies that if one condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the other condition (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement is \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\" This introduces uncertainty about Mark's action, suggesting that it's possible Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nCombining these two statements, if Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, and if Lisa buying the red shirt necessitates Mark buying the blue shirt, then we can infer that Lisa might not have bought the red shirt. This is because if Lisa had bought the red shirt, according to the first statement, Mark must have bought the blue shirt, which contradicts the uncertainty introduced by the second statement.\n\nHowever, the question asks if we can infer \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt,\" which is a definitive statement. The information given provides a basis for concluding that Lisa might not have bought the red shirt, but it does not conclusively prove that she did not buy it. The logic here hinges on the difference between \"might not have\" and \"did not,\" where \"might not have\" suggests a possibility, and \"did not\" is a definitive statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot definitively infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. We can only say that there's a possibility she did not buy it, given the uncertainty about Mark's purchase.\n\nAnswer: no",
