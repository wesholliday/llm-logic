The statement \"Either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door\" presents two possibilities as mutually exclusive events - one or the other must be true, but not both at the same time. The second statement, \"it's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door,\" eliminates the option that the shoes must be lined up by the door. Given that one of the two options must be true and the option of the shoes being lined up by the door is eliminated, we are left with the only possibility that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
