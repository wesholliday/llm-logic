We have two statements: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" and \"it's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\" The first statement presents two possibilities for the location of the sunglasses: either in her bag or perched on her head. The second statement negates the necessity of the sunglasses being perched on her head, which means we cannot conclude that they are definitely on her head. However, the structure of the first statement is such that if one option is not a must, the other option becomes the only possibility by the process of elimination. Therefore, if it's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head, the logical conclusion based on the given alternatives is that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
