The statement \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor\" presents two possibilities for the location of the missing puzzle piece: it is either in the box or blending in on the floor. The second statement, \"it's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor,\" eliminates the necessity of the puzzle piece being on the floor. Since the first statement gives us only two options and the second statement negates one of those options, logically, we are left with the remaining option as the only possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
