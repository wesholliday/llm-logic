The first statement is a disjunction: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\" This means that at least one of these conditions is true. The second statement negates one of the options: \"it's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\" This means that the option of the milk chilling in the fridge is not a necessity, or it is not true. Given that one of the options must be true (from the first statement) and knowing that the milk being in the fridge is not a necessity (from the second statement), we can infer that the milk being on the counter is the true condition, as it's the only remaining possibility from the original disjunction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
