We have two statements: \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist\" and \"it's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\" The first statement presents two possibilities for the watch's location, and the second statement eliminates one of those possibilities by stating that the watch does not have to be on his wrist. \n\nGiven the structure of the first statement as an \"either/or\" scenario, if one option is negated, we are left with the other option as the only possibility. The second statement negates the necessity of the watch being on his wrist, which leaves us with the watch charging on the dresser as the remaining possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
