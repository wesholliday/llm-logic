The first statement is \"Either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen.\" This can be represented as \"A or B,\" where A is \"the phone is in the living room\" and B is \"it must be ringing in the kitchen.\" The second statement is \"it's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen,\" which directly negates B. In logic, when you have \"A or B\" and then you negate B, you are left with A as the only possibility because the \"or\" condition no longer has B as a viable option.\n\nAnswer: yes",
