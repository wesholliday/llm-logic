The original statement is \"The zibber might be zazzle zizz zibber or blurble.\" This statement presents two possibilities for what the zibber might be: it could be \"zazzle zizz zibber\" or it could be \"blurble.\" The use of \"or\" indicates that these are alternatives. Therefore, if we isolate one of these alternatives, we can still logically say that it is a possibility mentioned in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
