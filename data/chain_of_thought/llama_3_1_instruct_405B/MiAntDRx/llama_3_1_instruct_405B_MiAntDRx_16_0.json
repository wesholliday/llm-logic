The original statement is \"The wibble might be wumble shimble or blurble wobble.\" This statement presents two possibilities for what the wibble might be: wumble shimble or blurble wobble. The use of \"or\" indicates that both options are potential candidates for what the wibble might be.\n\nGiven this information, we can examine the conclusion \"The wibble might be blurble wobble.\" This conclusion directly corresponds to one of the options presented in the original statement. Since the original statement explicitly mentions \"blurble wobble\" as a possibility, it logically follows that we can infer this conclusion from the given statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the original statement, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
