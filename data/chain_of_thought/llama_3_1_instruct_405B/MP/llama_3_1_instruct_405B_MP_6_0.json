The first statement, \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta,\" can be represented as \"Sue chose pizza \u2192 Bob chose pasta.\" The second statement is simply \"Sue chose pizza.\" \n\nIn logic, when we have a statement of the form \"If A, then B\" (A \u2192 B) and we also know that A is true, we can conclude that B is true. This is a basic rule of inference known as modus ponens.\n\nGiven that we have \"Sue chose pizza \u2192 Bob chose pasta\" and we know \"Sue chose pizza\" is true, we can apply modus ponens to conclude that \"Bob chose pasta\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
