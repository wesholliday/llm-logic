            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument using modus ponens, a valid form of argument in logic. The first statement, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" is a conditional statement that sets up a relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence at the wedding. It implies that if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true. The second statement, \"Mary was at the wedding,\" affirms the condition of the first statement, thereby triggering the consequence. Therefore, according to the rules of modus ponens, if we have \"If A, then B\" and we also have \"A,\" we can logically infer \"B.\" In this case, A is \"Mary was at the wedding,\" and B is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
