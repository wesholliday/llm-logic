            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument using modus ponens, a valid form of argument in logic. The first statement, \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow,\" is a conditional statement that sets up a relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana. It says that if the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the consequence (the banana being yellow) must also be true. The second statement, \"The apple was red,\" affirms the condition of the first statement. According to the rules of modus ponens, if we have a conditional statement (if A then B) and we know that the condition (A) is true, we can logically conclude that the consequence (B) is also true. Therefore, from the given statements, we can infer that the banana was yellow.\n\nAnswer: yes",
