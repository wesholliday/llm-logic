            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument using modus ponens, a valid form of argument in logic. The first statement, \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest,\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\" The second statement, \"The griffin was in the forest,\" asserts that the condition (A) is true. According to the rules of modus ponens, if we have \"If A, then B\" and we know A is true, we can conclude that B is true. Therefore, from the given statements, we can logically infer that \"The unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
