            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements and apply basic logical rules. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This can be represented as \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\" The second statement asserts that \"The car was red,\" which directly corresponds to the condition P in our conditional statement. \n\nIn logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, we can infer Q through a process called modus ponens. Modus ponens is a rule of inference that states if we have \"If P, then Q\" and P, we can conclude Q.\n\nGiven that we have \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" (our \"If P, then Q\") and we know \"The car was red\" (our P), we can use modus ponens to infer \"The truck was blue\" (our Q).\n\nAnswer: yes",
