            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a modus ponens argument in logic. The first statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is a conditional statement, often represented as \"If P, then Q\" or \"P \u2192 Q\". The second statement \"The shirt was cotton\" affirms the antecedent (P) of the conditional statement. According to the rule of modus ponens, if we have \"P \u2192 Q\" and \"P\", we can logically conclude \"Q\". Therefore, if we have \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" and \"The shirt was cotton\", we can infer \"The pants were denim\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
