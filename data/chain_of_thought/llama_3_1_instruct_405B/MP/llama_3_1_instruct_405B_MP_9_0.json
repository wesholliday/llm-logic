The first statement is a conditional statement: 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'. This means if the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the consequence (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is a factual statement: 'Lisa bought the red shirt'. This confirms that the condition in the first statement is indeed true.\n\n3. Since the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is confirmed to be true, according to the conditional statement, the consequence (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can logically infer that 'Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
