            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a conditional statement and its application. The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is a conditional statement where the condition is \"Tom watched football\" and the consequence is \"Jen watched basketball\". When we are given that \"Tom watched football\", we are essentially being told that the condition of the conditional statement is true. According to the rules of logic, if the condition of a conditional statement is true, then we can infer that the consequence is also true. Therefore, from the given statements, we can logically infer that \"Jen watched basketball\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
