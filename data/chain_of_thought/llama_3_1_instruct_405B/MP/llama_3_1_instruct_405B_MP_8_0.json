            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into a logical form. The first statement, \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake,\" can be represented as \"V \u2192 M,\" where V stands for \"the vampire was awake\" and M stands for \"the mummy was awake.\" The second statement, \"The vampire was awake,\" can be represented simply as \"V.\"\n\nGiven these representations, we can apply basic logical rules to infer the conclusion. The statement \"V \u2192 M\" is a conditional statement that indicates if the condition (V) is true, then the consequence (M) must also be true. When we are also given that \"V\" is true, we can directly conclude that \"M\" must be true according to the rule of modus ponens, which states that from \"P \u2192 Q\" and \"P,\" we can infer \"Q.\"\n\nTherefore, from \"V \u2192 M\" and \"V,\" we can logically infer \"M,\" which means \"The mummy was awake.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
