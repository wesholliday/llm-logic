            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into a logical form. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This can be represented as \"P \u2192 M\", where P stands for \"the doll was plastic\" and M stands for \"the truck was metal\". The second statement is a simple affirmation: \"The doll was plastic,\" which can be represented as \"P\".\n\nIn logic, when we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 M) and the antecedent (P) is affirmed, we can conclude the consequent (M). This is known as modus ponens, a basic rule of inference in logic. The form of modus ponens is:\n\n1. P \u2192 M\n2. P\n\u2234 M\n\nGiven that we have both the conditional statement and the affirmation of the antecedent, we can logically infer the consequent.\n\nAnswer: yes",
