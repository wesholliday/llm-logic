            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a syllogism in deductive reasoning. We have two premises: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" and \"The book was written by James\". The first premise sets up a conditional relationship between the authorship of the book and its genre. The second premise asserts that the condition (the book being written by James) is indeed true. According to the rules of deductive reasoning, if the condition of a conditional statement is true, then the conclusion of the conditional statement must also be true. Therefore, we can logically infer that \"The book is a mystery novel\" based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
