            "content": "Explanation: To assess the logical validity of the argument, we need to understand the modal terms involved, specifically \"must\" and \"might.\" In modal logic, \"must\" is associated with necessity, and \"might\" is associated with possibility. The premise states, \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding,\" which can be translated into modal logic as \u00ac\u25a1(Mary was at the wedding), where \u00ac represents negation and \u25a1 represents necessity. The conclusion states, \"Mary might not have been at the wedding,\" which can be translated as \u25c7\u00ac(Mary was at the wedding), where \u25c7 represents possibility.\n\nThe key to understanding the relationship between these two statements lies in the duality of the modal operators: \u00ac\u25a1p \u2261 \u25c7\u00acp. This duality means that saying \"it's not necessary that p\" is equivalent to saying \"it's possible that not p.\" Therefore, the premise directly implies the conclusion through this modal duality.\n\nGiven this understanding, the argument form is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise through the rules of modal logic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
