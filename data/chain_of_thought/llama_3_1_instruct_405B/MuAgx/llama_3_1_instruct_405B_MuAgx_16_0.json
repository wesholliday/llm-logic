It explicitly states that both conditions must be met. \n\nThe statement we are trying to infer combines these two conditions into a single statement using \"and\", which in logical terms means both conditions must be true. \n\nSince the original statement explicitly requires both conditions to be true, and the inferred statement also requires both conditions to be true, we can logically infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
