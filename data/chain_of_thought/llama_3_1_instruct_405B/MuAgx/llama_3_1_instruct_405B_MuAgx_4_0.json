            "content": "Explanation: To answer this question, we need to examine the original statement and the inferred statement. The original statement is 'The quorple must be at snork gribble and it must be in the wibble plonk'. This statement contains two separate clauses connected by 'and', each specifying a condition or requirement for the quorple: it must be at snork gribble, and it must be in the wibble plonk. \n\nThe inferred statement is 'The quorple must be at snork gribble and in the wibble plonk'. This statement combines the two conditions into a single clause, connected by 'and', but removes the repetition of 'it must be'. \n\nThe key to determining if the inference is valid lies in understanding the logical connection between the two clauses in the original statement. Since the original statement requires both conditions to be true (being at snork gribble and being in the wibble plonk), combining them into a single statement with 'and' does not alter the logical requirement for both conditions to be met.\n\nTherefore, the inferred statement logically follows from the original statement, as it maintains the necessity for both conditions (being at snork gribble and in the wibble plonk) without altering their logical relationship.\n\nAnswer: yes",
