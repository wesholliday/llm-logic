            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the statements logically. The original statement is \"It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter.\" This can be translated into a logical statement as \u00ac(the milk must be on the counter), where \u00ac denotes negation. The statement we are trying to infer is \"The milk might not be on the counter.\"\n\nIn modal logic, \"must\" is associated with necessity, and \"might\" is associated with possibility. The original statement negates the necessity of the milk being on the counter, which implies that there are scenarios where the milk is not on the counter. This directly aligns with the concept of possibility, as saying something is not necessary means it is possible for it not to be the case.\n\nTherefore, if it's not necessary for the milk to be on the counter, it implies that there are situations where the milk might not be on the counter, which directly supports the inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
