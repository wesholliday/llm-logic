            "content": "Explanation: To tackle this question, let's break down the statements into their logical components. The original statement is \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\" This can be translated into a logical statement as \u00ac(Mary must have been at the wedding), where \"\u00ac\" denotes negation. The statement we are trying to infer is \"Mary might not have been at the wedding.\"\n\nIn modal logic, \"must\" is associated with necessity, and \"might\" is associated with possibility. The original statement negates the necessity of Mary being at the wedding, which can be understood as saying it's not necessary that Mary was at the wedding. This implies there are scenarios where Mary was not at the wedding, which directly relates to the concept of possibility.\n\nNegating necessity implies possibility of the negated statement. Thus, if it's not necessary (must) for Mary to have been at the wedding, then it's possible (might) she was not there. This aligns with the principle that \u00ac(necessarily p) implies possibly \u00acp.\n\nTherefore, from \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding,\" we can logically infer \"Mary might not have been at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
