            "content": "Explanation: To tackle this question, let's break down the statements involved. The original statement is \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\" This statement negates the necessity of Lisa buying the red shirt. In modal logic, \"must\" is associated with necessity, and negating necessity implies possibility of the negation. Therefore, if it's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt, it implies there's a possibility she did not buy it. The statement we're asked to infer is \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt,\" which directly aligns with the implication that there's a possibility she did not buy the red shirt. \"Might not\" directly expresses the possibility of the negation, which is exactly what we derive from negating the necessity in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
