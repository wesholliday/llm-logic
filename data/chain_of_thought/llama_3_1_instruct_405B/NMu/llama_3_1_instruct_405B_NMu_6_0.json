            "content": "Explanation: To approach this question, let's break down the statements involved. The original statement is \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\" This statement negates the necessity of Sue choosing pizza, implying that there are scenarios where Sue did not choose pizza. The statement we are trying to infer is \"Sue might not have chosen pizza,\" which suggests the possibility of Sue not choosing pizza.\n\nThe original statement essentially says that it is not a requirement or a necessity for Sue to have chosen pizza, which naturally leads to the understanding that there is a possibility or scenarios where Sue did not choose pizza. This aligns with the concept of modal logic, where negating a necessity leads to the possibility of the negation. In simpler terms, if it's not the case that something must happen, then it's possible that it might not happen.\n\nTherefore, from \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza,\" we can logically infer \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" because the negation of necessity implies possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
