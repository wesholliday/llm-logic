(This can be represented as: F \u2192 S, where F stands for \"the zinger was fraggled\" and S stands for \"the zinger was smoogled\".)\n2. The zinger was not smoogled. (This can be represented as: \u00acS, where \u00ac denotes \"not\".)\n\nWe are asked to infer whether \"The zinger was not fraggled\" (\u00acF) from these statements.\n\nUsing the rules of logical deduction, specifically modus tollens, which states that if we have (P \u2192 Q) and \u00acQ, we can infer \u00acP, we can apply this rule to our given statements.\n\nGiven F \u2192 S and \u00acS, by modus tollens, we can infer \u00acF.\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\" and \"The zinger was not smoogled\", we can logically infer \"The zinger was not fraggled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
