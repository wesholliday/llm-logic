            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into a logical form. The first statement, \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged,\" can be represented as \"V \u2192 P,\" where V stands for \"the smonk was vreebled\" and P stands for \"the smonk plagged.\" The second statement, \"The smonk did not plagged,\" can be represented as \"\u00acP,\" where \u00ac denotes negation.\n\nGiven these representations, we can apply a basic rule of logic known as modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if we have \"A \u2192 B\" and \"\u00acB,\" we can infer \"\u00acA.\" Applying this rule to our statements, we have \"V \u2192 P\" and \"\u00acP,\" which allows us to infer \"\u00acV,\" meaning \"The smonk was not vreebled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
