            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into a logical form. The first statement, \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened,\" can be represented as \"V \u2192 S\" where V stands for \"the dreb was vroombed\" and S stands for \"the dreb was spened.\" The second statement, \"The dreb was not spened,\" can be represented as \"\u00acS\" (not S).\n\nGiven these, we want to find out if we can infer \"The dreb was not vroombed,\" which would be \"\u00acV\" (not V).\n\nUsing the rules of logical inference, specifically modus tollens, which states that if we have \"P \u2192 Q\" and \"\u00acQ,\" we can infer \"\u00acP,\" we can apply this rule directly to our problem.\n\nGiven \"V \u2192 S\" and \"\u00acS,\" applying modus tollens allows us to infer \"\u00acV,\" which means \"The dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
