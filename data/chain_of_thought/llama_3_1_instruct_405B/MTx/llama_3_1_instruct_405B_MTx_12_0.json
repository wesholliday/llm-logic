            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into a logical form. The first statement is \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint.\" This can be represented as \"A \u2192 B,\" where A is \"the smip was shripped\" and B is \"the smip lupped the zoint.\" The second statement is \"The smip did not lup the zoint,\" which can be represented as \"\u00acB\" (not B).\n\nGiven A \u2192 B and \u00acB, we want to determine if we can infer \u00acA (the smip was not shripped).\n\nIn logic, the rule of contrapositive states that if A \u2192 B, then \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA. This means if we have \"If A then B\" and we know B is false (\u00acB), we can infer that A is false (\u00acA).\n\nTherefore, applying the contrapositive rule to our statements, since we know the smip did not lup the zoint (\u00acB), we can infer that the smip was not shripped (\u00acA).\n\nAnswer: yes",
