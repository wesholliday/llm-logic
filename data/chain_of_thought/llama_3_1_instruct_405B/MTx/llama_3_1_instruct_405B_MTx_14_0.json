            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into a logical form. The first statement, \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged,\" can be represented as \"F \u2192 S,\" where F stands for \"the clug was fleeked\" and S stands for \"the clug snugged.\" The second statement, \"The clug did not snugged,\" can be represented as \"\u00acS,\" where \u00ac denotes negation.\n\nGiven these representations, we can apply a basic rule of logic known as modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if we have \"P \u2192 Q\" (if P then Q) and \"\u00acQ\" (not Q), we can infer \"\u00acP\" (not P). Applying this rule to our statements, we have \"F \u2192 S\" and \"\u00acS,\" which allows us to infer \"\u00acF,\" meaning \"the clug was not fleeked.\"\n\nTherefore, logically, from the statements \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\" and \"The clug did not snugged,\" we can indeed infer \"The clug was not fleeked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
