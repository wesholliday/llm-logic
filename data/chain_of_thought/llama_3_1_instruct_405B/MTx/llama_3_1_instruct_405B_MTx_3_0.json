            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into a logical form. The first statement, \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked,\" can be represented as \"M \u2192 Q,\" where M stands for \"the splat was morphed\" and Q stands for \"the splat quanked.\" The second statement, \"The splat did not quank,\" can be represented as \"\u00acQ,\" where \u00ac denotes negation.\n\nGiven these representations, we can apply basic rules of propositional logic. The rule that applies here is modus tollens, which states that if we have \"P \u2192 Q\" and \"\u00acQ,\" we can infer \"\u00acP.\"\n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements, we have:\n1. M \u2192 Q (If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked)\n2. \u00acQ (The splat did not quank)\n\nFrom these, we can infer \u00acM (The splat was not morphed).\n\nAnswer: yes",
