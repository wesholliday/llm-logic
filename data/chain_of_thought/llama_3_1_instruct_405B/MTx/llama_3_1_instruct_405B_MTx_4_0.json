            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into a logical form. The first statement, \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked,\" can be represented as \"A \u2192 B,\" where A is \"the fribble was snurgled\" and B is \"the fribble crinked.\" The second statement, \"The fribble did not crink,\" is the negation of B, represented as \"\u00acB.\"\n\nGiven A \u2192 B and \u00acB, we want to determine if we can infer \u00acA (the fribble was not snurgled).\n\nIn logic, the rule of contrapositive states that if A \u2192 B, then \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA. This means if we start with \"If A then B\" and we find out B is not true, we can infer A is not true.\n\nTherefore, applying the contrapositive rule to our statements, since we have \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\" and we know \"the fribble did not crink,\" we can logically infer \"the fribble was not snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
