            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into a logical form. The first statement is \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\" This can be represented as \"A \u2192 B,\" where A is \"the grommet was sploffed\" and B is \"the grommet plopped the frink.\" The second statement is \"The grommet did not plop the frink,\" which can be represented as \"\u00acB\" (not B).\n\nIn logic, when we have \"A \u2192 B\" and \"\u00acB,\" we can infer \"\u00acA\" through a process called modus tollens. Modus tollens is a rule of logic that states if we have \"If A, then B\" and \"not B,\" we can conclude \"not A.\"\n\nApplying this to our statements, since we have \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" (A \u2192 B) and \"The grommet did not plop the frink\" (\u00acB), we can infer \"The grommet was not sploffed\" (\u00acA).\n\nAnswer: yes",
