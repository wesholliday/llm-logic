(This can be represented as \"C \u2192 D\", where C stands for \"the sprocket was cranked\" and D stands for \"the sprocket was daggled\".)\n2. The sprocket was not daggled. (This can be represented as \"\u00acD\", where \u00ac denotes negation.)\n\nWe are asked to infer whether \"The sprocket was not cranked\" (which can be represented as \"\u00acC\").\n\nUsing the rules of propositional logic, specifically modus tollens, which states that from \"P \u2192 Q\" and \"\u00acQ\", we can infer \"\u00acP\", we can apply this rule directly to our problem.\n\nGiven \"C \u2192 D\" and \"\u00acD\", by modus tollens, we can infer \"\u00acC\".\n\nTherefore, from the statements given, we can logically infer that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
