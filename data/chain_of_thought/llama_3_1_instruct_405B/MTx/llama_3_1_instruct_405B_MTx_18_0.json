            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into logical terms. Let P represent \"the shank was plooked\" and N represent \"the shank was nugged\". The first statement is \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\", which can be represented as P \u2192 N. The second statement is \"The shank was not nugged\", which can be represented as \u00acN (where \u00ac denotes \"not\").\n\nGiven P \u2192 N and \u00acN, we want to determine if we can infer \u00acP (\"The shank was not plooked\").\n\nIn logic, the rule of contrapositive states that if P \u2192 N, then \u00acN \u2192 \u00acP. This means if we have \"If P then N\" and we know \"not N\", we can conclude \"not P\".\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can indeed infer \"The shank was not plooked\" because the logical structure of our statements allows us to conclude \u00acP from P \u2192 N and \u00acN.\n\nAnswer: yes",
