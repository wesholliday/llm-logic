            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into a logical form. The first statement is \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\" This can be represented as \"A \u2192 B,\" where A is \"the sneg was crampled\" and B is \"the sneg sproted the frink.\" The second statement is \"The sneg did not sproted the frink,\" which can be represented as \"\u00acB\" (not B).\n\nIn logic, when we have \"A \u2192 B\" and \"\u00acB,\" we can infer \"\u00acA\" through a process called modus tollens. Modus tollens is a rule of logic that states if we have \"If A, then B\" and \"not B,\" we can conclude \"not A.\"\n\nTherefore, given \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\" (A \u2192 B) and \"The sneg did not sproted the frink\" (\u00acB), we can logically infer \"The sneg was not crampled\" (\u00acA).\n\nAnswer: yes",
