            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into a logical form. The first statement, \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished,\" can be represented as \"P \u2192 V,\" where P stands for \"the twonk was plinked\" and V stands for \"the twonk was varnished.\" The second statement, \"The twonk was not varnished,\" can be represented as \"\u00acV\" (not V).\n\nGiven these, we want to determine if we can infer \"The twonk was not plinked,\" which would be \"\u00acP\" (not P).\n\nUsing the rules of propositional logic, specifically the rule of contrapositive inference, we know that from \"P \u2192 V\" we can infer \"\u00acV \u2192 \u00acP.\" Given \"\u00acV\" (the twonk was not varnished), we can indeed infer \"\u00acP\" (the twonk was not plinked) through modus ponens (since we have both \"\u00acV \u2192 \u00acP\" and \"\u00acV\").\n\nTherefore, logically, from the given statements, we can infer that the twonk was not plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
