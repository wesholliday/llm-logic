            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into a logical argument form.\n\n1. If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled. (This can be represented as: S \u2192 G, where S = the wug was sproinged, and G = the wug was garpled.)\n2. The wug was not garpled. (This can be represented as: \u00acG, where \u00ac denotes \"not\".)\n\nWe are asked to infer whether \"The wug was not sproinged\" (\u00acS) from these statements.\n\nUsing the rules of logical inference, specifically modus tollens, which states that if we have (P \u2192 Q) and \u00acQ, we can infer \u00acP, we can apply this rule to our given statements.\n\nGiven S \u2192 G and \u00acG, by modus tollens, we can infer \u00acS.\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" and \"The wug was not garpled\", we can logically infer \"The wug was not sproinged\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
