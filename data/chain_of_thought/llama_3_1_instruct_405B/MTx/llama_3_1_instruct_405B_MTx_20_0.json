            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into a logical form. The first statement, \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned,\" can be represented as \"A \u2192 B,\" where A is \"the fleeg was bluttered\" and B is \"it surned.\" The second statement, \"The fleeg did not surn,\" can be represented as \"\u00acB,\" where \u00ac denotes negation.\n\nGiven A \u2192 B and \u00acB, we want to determine if we can infer \u00acA (\"The fleeg was not bluttered\").\n\nIn logic, the rule of contrapositive states that from A \u2192 B, we can infer \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA. Given \u00acB, we can then infer \u00acA.\n\nSo, applying the contrapositive rule to our statements, from \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" and \"The fleeg did not surn,\" we can logically infer \"The fleeg was not bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
