            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into a logical form. The first statement, \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated,\" can be represented as \"A \u2192 B,\" where A is \"the flob was skizzled\" and B is \"the flob movated.\" The second statement, \"The flob did not movated,\" is the negation of B, represented as \"\u00acB.\"\n\nGiven A \u2192 B and \u00acB, we want to determine if we can infer \u00acA (the flob was not skizzled).\n\nIn logic, the rule of contrapositive states that if A \u2192 B, then \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA. This means if we have \"If A then B\" and we find out B is not true, we can infer A is not true.\n\nTherefore, applying the contrapositive rule to our statements, since we have \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated\" and we know \"the flob did not movated,\" we can logically infer \"the flob was not skizzled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
