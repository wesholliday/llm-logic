            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into logical form. The first statement, \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked,\" can be represented as \"S \u2192 T,\" where S stands for \"the whiffle was shanked\" and T stands for \"the whiffle tinked.\" The second statement, \"The whiffle did not tink,\" can be represented as \"\u00acT,\" where \u00ac denotes negation.\n\nGiven these representations, we can apply basic rules of propositional logic. The rule that applies here is modus tollens, which states that if we have \"P \u2192 Q\" and \"\u00acQ,\" we can infer \"\u00acP.\"\n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements, we have:\n1. S \u2192 T (If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked)\n2. \u00acT (The whiffle did not tink)\n\nFrom these, we can infer \u00acS (The whiffle was not shanked), following the modus tollens rule.\n\nAnswer: yes",
