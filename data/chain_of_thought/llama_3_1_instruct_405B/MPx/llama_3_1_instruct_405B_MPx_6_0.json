            "content": "Explanation: This question involves a basic form of logical reasoning known as modus ponens. Modus ponens is a rule of inference that states if we have \"If A, then B\" and we also have A, we can conclude B. In this scenario, \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" is our \"If A, then B\" statement, where A is \"the grommet was sploffed\" and B is \"the grommet plopped the frink\". We are also given \"The grommet was sploffed\", which is our A. Following the rule of modus ponens, since we have both \"If A, then B\" and A, we can logically conclude B, which is \"The grommet plopped the frink\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
