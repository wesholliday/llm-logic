            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The sprocket was daggled' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements. The first statement is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B', where A is 'the sprocket was cranked' and B is 'the sprocket was daggled'. The second statement asserts that A is true, i.e., 'The sprocket was cranked'. According to the rules of deductive reasoning, specifically modus ponens, if we have 'If A, then B' and we know A is true, we can conclude that B is true. Therefore, from 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled' and 'The sprocket was cranked', we can logically infer 'The sprocket was daggled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
