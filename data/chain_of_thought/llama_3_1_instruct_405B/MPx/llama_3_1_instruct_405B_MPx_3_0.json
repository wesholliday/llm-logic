            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into a logical form. The first statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" can be represented as \"M \u2192 Q\" where M stands for \"the splat was morphed\" and Q stands for \"the splat quanked\". The second statement \"The splat was morphed\" can be represented simply as \"M\".\n\nGiven these representations, we can apply basic rules of propositional logic. The statement \"M \u2192 Q\" means that if M is true, then Q must also be true. Since we are also given that \"M\" is true (the splat was morphed), we can logically conclude that \"Q\" (the splat quanked) must also be true.\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus ponens, a fundamental rule of inference in logic, which states that if we have \"P \u2192 Q\" and \"P\", we can infer \"Q\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
