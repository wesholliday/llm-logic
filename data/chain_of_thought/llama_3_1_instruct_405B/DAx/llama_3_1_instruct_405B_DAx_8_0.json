The first statement is 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled'. This is a conditional statement that only tells us something about the state of the sprocket being daggled if it was cranked. It does not provide information about the state of the sprocket being daggled if it was not cranked.\n\n2. The second statement is 'The sprocket was not cranked'. This statement directly negates the condition (the sprocket being cranked) that would lead to the conclusion that the sprocket was daggled, according to the first statement.\n\nHowever, the absence of the condition (cranking) does not necessarily imply the absence of the consequence (daggling). The sprocket could still be daggled due to reasons not covered by the conditional statement. The conditional statement only guarantees daggling if cranking occurs, but it does not rule out daggling happening for other reasons.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer 'The sprocket was not daggled' from the given statements because the information provided does not cover all possible reasons for the sprocket to be daggled.\n\nAnswer: no",
