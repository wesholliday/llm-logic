            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into logical form. The first statement, \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked,\" can be represented as \"M \u2192 Q,\" where M stands for \"the splat was morphed\" and Q stands for \"the splat quanked.\" The second statement, \"The splat was not morphed,\" can be represented as \"\u00acM,\" where \u00ac denotes negation.\n\nFrom the first statement, we have a conditional statement that only tells us something about the splat quanking if it was morphed. It does not provide information about what happens if the splat was not morphed. The second statement tells us the splat was not morphed, which means we cannot apply the conditional statement to conclude anything about whether the splat quanked or not.\n\nIn logic, from \"M \u2192 Q\" and \"\u00acM,\" we cannot infer \"\u00acQ\" (the splat did not quank) because the conditional \"M \u2192 Q\" only guarantees Q if M is true. If M is false (as given by \"\u00acM\"), we have no information about Q. This is a classic example of a logical fallacy known as \"denying the antecedent.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
