            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The concert must have started at 8 PM' from 'The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statement. The original statement is a conjunction of two conditions: the concert being sold out and the concert starting at 8 PM. The use of 'and' indicates that both conditions are being asserted as true. Therefore, if the original statement is true, it logically follows that each of the individual conditions is also true. This means we can indeed infer that 'The concert must have started at 8 PM' because it is one of the conditions asserted in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
