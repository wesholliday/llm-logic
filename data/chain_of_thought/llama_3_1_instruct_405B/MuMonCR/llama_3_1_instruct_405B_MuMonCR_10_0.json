            "content": "Explanation: To answer this question, we need to analyze the given statement and determine if the inference is logically valid. The original statement is \"The document must have been signed and notarized.\" This statement requires two conditions to be met: the document must be signed, and it must be notarized. The inferred statement is \"The document must have been notarized.\" This statement only mentions one of the conditions from the original statement.\n\nSince the original statement requires the document to be both signed and notarized, we can logically conclude that if the document must meet both conditions, then it must meet each condition individually. Therefore, if the document must be signed and notarized, it inherently means that it must be notarized.\n\nAnswer: yes",
