            "content": "Explanation: To answer this question, we need to analyze the given statement and determine if the inference is logically valid. The original statement is \"The application must have been completed online and included references.\" This statement contains two conditions: (1) the application must have been completed online, and (2) it must have included references. The question asks if we can infer that \"The application must have included references\" from the original statement.\n\nSince the original statement explicitly mentions that the application must have included references as one of its conditions, it is logically valid to infer this condition on its own. The fact that the application must have been completed online is an additional condition, but it does not affect the necessity of including references.\n\nTherefore, the inference is valid because including references is a stated requirement that is not dependent on the method of application completion for its necessity.\n\nAnswer: yes",
