            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The package must have been signed for' from 'The package must have been delivered today and signed for', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statement. The original statement is a conjunction of two conditions: the package being delivered today and the package being signed for. Both conditions are presented as necessary for the statement to be true. If we remove the condition of the package being delivered today, we are left with the condition of the package being signed for, which is still asserted as a necessity by the word 'must'. Therefore, the statement implies that for the original condition to be true, the package indeed must have been signed for, regardless of the specific day of delivery being today.\n\nAnswer: yes",
