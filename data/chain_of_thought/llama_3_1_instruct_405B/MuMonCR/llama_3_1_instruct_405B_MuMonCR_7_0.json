            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The exam must have covered all chapters' from 'The exam must have been difficult and covered all chapters', we need to analyze the logical structure of the original statement. The original statement is a conjunction, meaning it contains two clauses ('The exam must have been difficult' and 'covered all chapters') joined by 'and'. In a conjunction, both clauses must be true for the entire statement to be true. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then it logically follows that 'The exam must have covered all chapters' is also true, as it is one of the clauses in the conjunction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
