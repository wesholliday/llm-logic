The original statement specifies two conditions: the movie being in English and having subtitles. Since 'having subtitles' is explicitly mentioned as one of the conditions, it is directly stated and not an inference that needs to be drawn from other information. Therefore, we can indeed infer that 'The movie must have had subtitles' because it is a part of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
