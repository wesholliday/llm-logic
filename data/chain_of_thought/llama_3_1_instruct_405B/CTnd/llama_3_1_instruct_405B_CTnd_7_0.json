            "content": "Explanation: To analyze this, let's break down the given statement into its components using propositional logic. Let's denote \"the customer was served\" as S and \"the customer was served promptly\" as P.\n\nThe original statement is: If the customer was served, then he was not served promptly. This can be written as S \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nWe are asked to infer: If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served. This can be written as P \u2192 \u00acS.\n\nTo determine if the inference is valid, we can examine the truth table or use logical equivalences. However, a straightforward approach is to recognize the relationship between these statements as a form of contrapositive inference.\n\nThe contrapositive of S \u2192 \u00acP is \u00ac(\u00acP) \u2192 \u00acS, which simplifies to P \u2192 \u00acS. This matches the statement we were asked to infer.\n\nTherefore, the inference from 'If the customer was served, then he was not served promptly' to 'If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served' is logically valid because the second statement is the contrapositive of the first, and in classical logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: yes",
