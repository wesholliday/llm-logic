The statement A \u2192 \u00acE tells us that if A is true, then E must be false. However, it does not directly tell us what happens if E is true; it only tells us that E cannot be true if A is true.\n\nIn classical logic, from A \u2192 \u00acE, we cannot directly infer E \u2192 \u00acA. The original statement only guarantees that if the issue was addressed, it wasn't addressed effectively. It doesn't provide information about the scenario where the issue was addressed effectively; specifically, it doesn't assert that the issue wasn't addressed at all in such a case.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer \"If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed\" from \"If the issue was addressed, then it was not addressed effectively.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
