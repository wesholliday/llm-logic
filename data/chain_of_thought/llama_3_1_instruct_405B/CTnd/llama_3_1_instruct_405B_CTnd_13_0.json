            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statement and the statement we're trying to infer into logical notation. Let's denote \"Alex exercised\" as E and \"Alex exercised much\" as M.\n\nThe given statement is \"If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much,\" which can be written as E \u2192 \u00acM.\n\nThe statement we're trying to infer is \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise,\" which can be written as M \u2192 \u00acE.\n\nTo see if we can infer the second statement from the first, let's examine their truth tables or logical equivalences. The first statement implies that if E is true, then M must be false. However, it does not directly address what happens if M is true; it only deals with the scenario where E is true.\n\nThe second statement, M \u2192 \u00acE, suggests that if M is true, then E must be false. This seems to be a different assertion than the first statement, as the first statement does not provide information about the truth value of E when M is true; it only tells us about the truth value of M when E is true.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, we can see a connection through contrapositive reasoning. The contrapositive of E \u2192 \u00acM is M \u2192 \u00acE. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning they have the same truth values under all conditions.\n\nTherefore, from \"If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much,\" we can indeed infer \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise\" because the latter is the contrapositive of the former.\n\nAnswer: yes",
