            "content": "Explanation: To analyze this, let's break down the given statement into its components using propositional logic. Let's denote \"the job was completed\" as \\(C\\) and \"the job was completed well\" as \\(W\\). The original statement is \"If the job was completed, then it was not completed well,\" which translates to \\(C \\rightarrow \\neg W\\).\n\nWe are asked to infer \"If the job was completed well, then it was not completed,\" which translates to \\(W \\rightarrow \\neg C\\).\n\nIn propositional logic, the original statement implies that if \\(C\\) is true, then \\(W\\) must be false. However, it does not directly address what happens if \\(W\\) is true; it only establishes that \\(W\\) cannot be true if \\(C\\) is true.\n\nTo infer \\(W \\rightarrow \\neg C\\), we need to understand that this statement is the contrapositive of \\(C \\rightarrow \\neg W\\). The contrapositive of a statement \\(P \\rightarrow Q\\) is \\(\\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P\\), and it is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, \\(C \\rightarrow \\neg W\\) is logically equivalent to \\(\\neg \\neg W \\rightarrow \\neg C\\), which simplifies to \\(W \\rightarrow \\neg C\\).\n\nGiven this logical equivalence, we can indeed infer \"If the job was completed well, then it was not completed\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
