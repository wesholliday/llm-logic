            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statement into its components using propositional logic. Let \"A\" represent \"Ann exercised\" and \"S\" represent \"Ann exercised strenuously\".\n\nThe original statement is: If Ann exercised, then she did not exercise strenuously. This can be represented as A \u2192 \u00acS.\n\nWe are asked to infer: If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise. This can be represented as S \u2192 \u00acA.\n\nTo determine if the inference is valid, we can examine the truth table for both statements or analyze them logically. However, a quicker method is to recognize the relationship between the original statement and the inferred statement. The inferred statement is essentially the contrapositive of the original statement, but with the positions of \"exercised\" and \"exercised strenuously\" swapped.\n\nThe original statement implies that exercising (A) negates the possibility of exercising strenuously (S), which suggests a relationship where A and S cannot coexist. The inferred statement suggests that exercising strenuously (S) negates the possibility of exercising (A), which seems to imply the same mutual exclusivity.\n\nHowever, the logical structure of the original statement (A \u2192 \u00acS) does indeed support the inference that if Ann exercised strenuously (S), then she did not just exercise (\u00acA), because the original statement establishes that exercising (A) would mean she did not exercise strenuously (\u00acS), implying that strenuous exercise (S) is not considered within the bounds of simply exercising (A) in this context.\n\nTherefore, the inference is logically sound because it respects the mutual exclusivity implied by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
