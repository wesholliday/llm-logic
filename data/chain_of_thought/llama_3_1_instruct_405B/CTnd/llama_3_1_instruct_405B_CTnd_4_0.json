            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statement into its components using propositional logic. Let \"Ben studied\" be represented as S and \"Ben studied diligently\" be represented as D.\n\nThe original statement is: If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently. This can be represented as S \u2192 \u00acD.\n\nWe are asked to infer: If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study. This can be represented as D \u2192 \u00acS.\n\nTo determine if the inference is valid, we can examine the relationship between these two statements. The original statement implies that studying (S) leads to not studying diligently (\u00acD), which suggests a relationship where diligent studying (D) is excluded when Ben studies (S).\n\nHowever, the inference we are asked to make reverses the conditions and outcomes. It suggests that if Ben studied diligently (D), then he did not study (\u00acS). This is essentially asking if the original statement's converse is logically equivalent or can be inferred from the original statement.\n\nIn classical logic, the original statement S \u2192 \u00acD does not logically imply its converse, D \u2192 \u00acS, without additional assumptions or premises. The original statement only guarantees that if Ben studied, then it was not diligent; it does not directly address the scenario where Ben studied diligently as the starting condition.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement alone, we cannot logically infer the conclusion \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
