            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statement into a logical form. The original statement is \"If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly.\" We can represent this as \"If A, then not B,\" where A is \"the room was cleaned\" and B is \"the room was cleaned thoroughly.\"\n\nTo infer the second statement, \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned,\" we need to examine if it logically follows from the first statement. The second statement can be represented as \"If B, then not A.\"\n\nThe original statement implies that cleaning the room (A) results in it not being cleaned thoroughly (not B), but it does not directly address the outcome of thorough cleaning (B) in relation to the room not being cleaned (not A). The first statement suggests a specific outcome (not B) from a specific action (A), but it does not logically imply that if the room was cleaned thoroughly (B), it was not cleaned (not A), because the original premise does not cover the scenario of thorough cleaning as the starting condition.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned\" from the given statement \"If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
