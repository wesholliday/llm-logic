            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statement into its components using propositional logic. Let's denote \"the issue was discussed\" as D and \"the issue was discussed in depth\" as I.\n\nThe original statement is: If D, then not I. This can be written as D \u2192 \u00acI.\n\nWe are asked to infer: If I, then not D. This can be written as I \u2192 \u00acD.\n\nIn propositional logic, the original statement D \u2192 \u00acI is logically equivalent to \u00acI \u2228 \u00acD by the material implication rule. However, this does not directly give us I \u2192 \u00acD.\n\nTo see if we can infer I \u2192 \u00acD from D \u2192 \u00acI, we can look at the contrapositive of D \u2192 \u00acI, which is \u00ac(\u00acI) \u2192 \u00acD, simplifying to I \u2192 \u00acD. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, from \"If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth,\" we can indeed infer \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
