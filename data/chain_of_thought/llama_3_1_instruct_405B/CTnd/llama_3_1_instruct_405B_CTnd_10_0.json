However, it does not logically follow that if helpful advice was offered (H), then no advice was offered at all (not A). The original statement speaks to the quality of the advice given (not helpful), not to the occurrence of advice-giving itself being negated by the helpfulness of the advice.\n\nIn essence, the original statement does not logically lead to the inferred statement because the premise of the original statement (advice being offered) is about the condition under which advice is not helpful, not about the absence of advice-giving when helpful advice is offered.\n\nAnswer: no",
