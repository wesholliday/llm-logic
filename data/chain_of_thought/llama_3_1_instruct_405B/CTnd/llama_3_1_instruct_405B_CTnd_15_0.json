            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statement into its components. The original statement is \"If the room was tidied, then it was not tidied thoroughly.\" This can be represented as \"T \u2192 \u00acTT\", where \"T\" stands for \"the room was tidied\" and \"TT\" stands for \"the room was tidied thoroughly\".\n\nTo infer \"If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied\" from the original statement, we need to examine the logical relationship between these statements. The inferred statement can be represented as \"TT \u2192 \u00acT\".\n\nHowever, the original statement does not logically imply the inferred statement. The original statement suggests that any tidying done was not thorough, but it does not provide a basis to conclude that thorough tidying implies no tidying at all. In fact, \"thorough tidying\" is a subset of \"tidying\", so if a room was tidied thoroughly, it was indeed tidied.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer \"If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
