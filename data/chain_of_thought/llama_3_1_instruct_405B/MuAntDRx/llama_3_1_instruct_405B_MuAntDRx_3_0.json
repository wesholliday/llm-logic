The use of 'or' indicates that these are alternatives, and it does not guarantee that the floob is in one specific location. It only guarantees that it is in at least one of the two mentioned locations. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that 'The floob must be on the quibble' because it could also be in the bimboozle.\n\nAnswer: no",
