            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The wozzle must be flibbit floob or flibbit blimple' presents two possibilities for what the wozzle must be: either flibbit floob or flibbit blimple. The use of 'or' indicates that both options are viable, but it does not guarantee that both are true simultaneously. It only guarantees that at least one of them is true. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that 'The wozzle must be flibbit blimple' because the wozzle could also be flibbit floob.\n\nAnswer: no",
