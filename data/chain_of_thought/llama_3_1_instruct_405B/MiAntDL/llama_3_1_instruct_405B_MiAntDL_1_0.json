The given statement is \"The envelope might be under a bed or upstairs.\" This is a disjunctive statement, meaning it presents two possibilities connected by \"or.\" In logic, when we have a statement of the form \"A or B,\" we can infer \"A\" might be true and we can also infer \"B\" might be true, because at least one of the disjuncts must be true for the whole statement to be true.\n\nGiven this, if we look at the statement \"The envelope might be under a bed or upstairs,\" we can infer \"The envelope might be under a bed\" because it is one of the disjuncts presented as a possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
