            "content": "Explanation: To answer this question, we need to analyze the original statement and the inferred statement. The original statement is 'The package might be delivered today or tomorrow', which indicates that there are two possible days for the delivery: today and tomorrow. The word 'or' is a disjunction operator that connects the two possibilities. \n\nWhen we infer 'The package might be delivered today' from the original statement, we are essentially extracting one of the possibilities mentioned. Since the original statement explicitly mentions 'today' as one of the possible delivery days, it logically follows that 'The package might be delivered today' is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
