The original statement presents two possibilities: the flight being delayed or the flight being on time. The use of 'or' indicates that at least one of these options is a possibility. Since 'The flight might be delayed' is explicitly mentioned as one of the possibilities in the original statement, it logically follows that we can indeed infer this statement from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
