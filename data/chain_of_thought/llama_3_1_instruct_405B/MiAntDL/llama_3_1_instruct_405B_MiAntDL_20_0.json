The original statement is \"The event might be formal or semi-formal.\" This statement indicates that there are two possibilities for the nature of the event: it could be either formal or semi-formal. \n\nWhen we look at the inferred statement, \"The event might be formal,\" we see that it captures one of the possibilities mentioned in the original statement. Since the original statement presents \"formal\" as one of the options, it logically follows that we can indeed infer \"The event might be formal\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
