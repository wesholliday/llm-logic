            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements and apply basic logical reasoning. The first statement is \"Either the splat is morphed or it is quanked.\" This is a classic example of an \"or\" statement in logic, meaning at least one of the conditions must be true. The second statement is \"The splat is not quanked,\" which directly negates one of the options presented in the first statement.\n\nGiven that the second statement eliminates the possibility of the splat being quanked, we are left with the only other option from the first statement, which is that the splat is morphed. This is because in an \"or\" condition, if one option is proven false, and it is given that at least one of the options must be true, then the remaining option must be true.\n\nTherefore, logically, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
