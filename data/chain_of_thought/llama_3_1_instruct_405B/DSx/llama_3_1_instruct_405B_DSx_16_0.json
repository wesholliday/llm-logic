            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the information given into logical steps. The first statement is a disjunction (an \"or\" statement) that presents two possibilities about the state of the sneg: it is either crampled or sproted. The second statement is a negation of one of those possibilities, stating that the sneg is not sproted. \n\nIn logic, when you have a disjunction and one of the disjuncts is negated, you can infer that the other disjunct is true. This is based on the principle of disjunctive syllogism, which states that if we know that either A or B is true, and we also know that A is not true, then we can conclude that B must be true.\n\nApplying this principle to the given statements, since we know the sneg is either crampled or sproted, and we also know it is not sproted, we can logically conclude that the sneg is crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
