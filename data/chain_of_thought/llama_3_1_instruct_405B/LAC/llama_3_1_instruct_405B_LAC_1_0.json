            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can logically infer 'Mary was at the wedding' from the given statements, let's analyze the information step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This means that the presence of Mary at the wedding guarantees the presence of Sue, but it does not necessarily work the other way around. Sue could be at the wedding without Mary being there.\n\n2. The second statement is a factual statement: \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This confirms that Sue was indeed at the wedding, but it does not provide direct information about Mary's presence.\n\n3. From these two statements, we cannot logically infer that Mary was at the wedding. The presence of Sue is guaranteed by the first statement if Mary is there, but the second statement only confirms Sue's presence, not Mary's. There is no logical basis to conclude that Mary must have been at the wedding simply because Sue was there.\n\nAnswer: no",
