            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into a logical form. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be represented as \"A \u2192 B\" where A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana was yellow.\" The second statement is simply \"The banana was yellow,\" which we can represent as \"B.\"\n\nThe question is asking if we can logically infer \"The apple was red\" (A) from these two statements.\n\nIn logic, the form of argument we're dealing with here is called \"affirming the consequent,\" which looks like this:\n\n1. A \u2192 B\n2. B\n\u2234 A\n\nThis form of argument is considered invalid because the truth of the consequent (B) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (A). There could be other reasons why the banana was yellow that have nothing to do with the color of the apple.\n\nFor example, consider this analogous argument:\n\n1. If it is raining, then the streets are wet.\n2. The streets are wet.\n\u2234 It is raining.\n\nThis conclusion is not logically justified because the streets could be wet for reasons other than rain (e.g., a burst pipe, a flooded river, etc.).\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer \"The apple was red\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
