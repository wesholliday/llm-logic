            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can conclude 'Mary was at the wedding' from the given statements, let's analyze the logical structure of the statements. The first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B\" where A is 'Mary was at the wedding' and B is 'Sue was at the wedding'. The second statement simply asserts B, 'Sue was at the wedding'. \n\nIn logical terms, from \"If A, then B\" and B, we cannot necessarily conclude A. The reason is that the conditional \"If A, then B\" only guarantees that if A is true, then B must be true, but it does not guarantee that if B is true, then A must be true. B could be true for reasons unrelated to A. \n\nFor example, consider \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\" and \"The ground is wet\". We cannot conclude from these statements that it is raining because the ground could be wet for other reasons (e.g., a burst pipe, a flood, etc.). \n\nTherefore, from 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' and 'Sue was at the wedding', we cannot logically conclude 'Mary was at the wedding'.\n\nAnswer: no",
