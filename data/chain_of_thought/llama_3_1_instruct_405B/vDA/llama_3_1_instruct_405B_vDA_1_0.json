            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument's form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Not P\n3. Therefore, Not Q\n\nWhere P represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q represents \"Sue was at the wedding\".\n\nThe first premise sets up a conditional relationship between P and Q, stating that if P is true, then Q must also be true. However, it does not assert that Q can only be true if P is true; there might be other conditions under which Q can be true.\n\nThe second premise states that P is not true. From this, we cannot conclude that Q is not true because the first premise only guarantees Q's truth if P is true, not that Q is false if P is false. Q's truth value is independent of P's when P is false.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that Sue was not at the wedding does not logically follow from the premises. The argument is attempting to make an invalid logical inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
