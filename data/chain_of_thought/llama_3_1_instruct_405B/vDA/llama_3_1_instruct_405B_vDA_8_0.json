            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument's form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q (If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake)\n2. Not P (The vampire was not awake)\n3. Therefore, Not Q (The mummy was not awake)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"denying the antecedent,\" where the first premise sets up a conditional relationship between two statements (P and Q), the second premise denies the antecedent (P), and the conclusion denies the consequent (Q). However, just because the antecedent is false, it does not necessarily mean the consequent is false. The mummy could still be awake even if the vampire is not, as there is no direct logical connection made between the vampire being asleep and the mummy's state based on the given premises.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid because it assumes a relationship between the negation of the antecedent and the negation of the consequent that is not necessarily true based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
