            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument's form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q (If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel)\n2. Not P (The book was not written by James)\n3. Therefore, Not Q (The book is not a mystery novel)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"denying the antecedent,\" where the first premise sets up a conditional relationship between P and Q, the second premise denies P (the antecedent), and the conclusion denies Q. However, denying the antecedent does not logically lead to the denial of the consequent (Q). The book could still be a mystery novel even if it was not written by James, as there are other possible authors of mystery novels.\n\nThe error in this argument form is assuming that because one condition (being written by James) that would make the book a mystery novel is not met, the book cannot be a mystery novel under any other condition, which is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: no",
