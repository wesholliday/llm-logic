            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument's form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Not P\n3. Therefore, Not Q\n\nWhere P represents \"Tom watched football\" and Q represents \"Jen watched basketball\".\n\nIn logic, this form of argument is known as \"denying the antecedent,\" which is a fallacy. The first premise only guarantees that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. It does not provide any information about what happens if Tom did not watch football. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that Jen did not watch basketball based on the information given.\n\nThe conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises because there is no logical connection established between Tom not watching football and Jen not watching basketball. Jen could have watched basketball regardless of Tom's actions, as the first premise only sets a condition for one specific scenario (Tom watching football) and does not cover all possible scenarios.\n\nAnswer: no",
