            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument's form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Not P\n3. Therefore, Not Q\n\nWhere P represents \"the car was red\" and Q represents \"the truck was blue\".\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"denying the antecedent,\" which is a logical fallacy. The first premise only guarantees that if the car was red, the truck was blue, but it does not provide any information about the color of the truck if the car was not red. The second premise tells us the car was not red, but from this, we cannot conclude anything about the color of the truck based on the given premises. The conclusion that the truck was not blue does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
