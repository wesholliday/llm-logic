            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument's form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Not P\n3. Therefore, Not Q\n\nWhere P represents \"the apple was red\" and Q represents \"the banana was yellow\".\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"denying the antecedent,\" which is a logical fallacy. The first premise only guarantees that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. It does not provide any information about the color of the banana if the apple was not red. The second premise tells us the apple was not red, but from this, we cannot conclude anything about the color of the banana based on the given premises. The banana could still be yellow, or it could be any other color. The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
