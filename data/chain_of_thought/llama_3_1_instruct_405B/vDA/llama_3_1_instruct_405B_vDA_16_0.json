            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument's form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Not P\n3. Therefore, Not Q\n\nWhere P represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q represents \"the pants were denim\".\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"denying the antecedent,\" which is a logical fallacy. The first premise only guarantees that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim, but it does not provide any information about the material of the pants if the shirt was not cotton. The second premise tells us the shirt was not cotton, which does not necessarily mean the pants were not denim. There is no logical connection that allows us to conclude the pants were not denim based on the shirt not being cotton.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises, making this form of argument logically invalid.\n\nAnswer: no",
