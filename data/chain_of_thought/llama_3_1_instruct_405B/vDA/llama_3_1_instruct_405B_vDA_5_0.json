            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument's form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Not P\n3. Therefore, Not Q\n\nWhere P represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q represents \"Amy played tennis\".\n\nIn logic, this form is known as \"denying the antecedent,\" which is a fallacy. The first premise only guarantees that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. It does not provide any information about what happens if Jeff did not play basketball. Amy could still have played tennis even if Jeff did not play basketball. The conclusion that Amy did not play tennis does not logically follow from the premises given.\n\nAnswer: no",
