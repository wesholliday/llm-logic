            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank' from 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked', we need to examine the logical structure of the statements. The original statement is in the form of 'If A, then B', which implies that A is a sufficient condition for B, but it does not necessarily mean that A is a necessary condition for B. In other words, just because the splat being morphed leads to it quanking, it doesn't mean that there are no other conditions under which the splat could quank.\n\nThe inference we are asked to evaluate is essentially the contrapositive of the converse of the original statement. The converse would be 'If the splat quanked, then it was morphed', and its contrapositive is 'If the splat was not morphed, then it did not quank'. However, the converse of a statement does not logically follow from the original statement unless the original statement is also the converse, making it an 'if and only if' relationship.\n\nGiven the information provided, we cannot logically infer 'If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank' because the original statement does not preclude the possibility of the splat quanking under different conditions.\n\nAnswer: no",
