            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into logical premises and analyze the conclusion we're asked to draw.\n\n1. \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" can be represented as \"Doll is plastic \u2192 Truck is metal.\"\n2. We are also given that \"The truck was metal\" is true.\n\nWe're asked to determine if it logically follows that \"The doll was plastic\" is true based on these premises.\n\nThe first statement sets up a conditional relationship where if the antecedent (the doll being plastic) is true, then the consequent (the truck being metal) must also be true. However, it does not state that the truck being metal is dependent solely on the doll being plastic. There could be other reasons why the truck is metal.\n\nThe second statement simply confirms that the truck is indeed metal, which aligns with the consequent of the first statement. However, confirming the consequent of a conditional statement does not logically necessitate that the antecedent is true. In logic, this is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically conclude that the doll was plastic simply because the truck was metal. There is not enough information to determine the material of the doll based on the material of the truck.\n\nAnswer: no",
