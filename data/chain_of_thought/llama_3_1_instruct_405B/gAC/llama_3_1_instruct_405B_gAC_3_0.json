            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into logical premises and analyze the conclusion we're asked to draw.\n\n1. \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as \"A \u2192 B,\" where A is \"the book was written by James\" and B is \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\n2. We are also given that \"The book is a mystery novel\" is true, which directly tells us that B is true.\n\nThe question asks if it logically follows that \"The book was written by James\" (A) is true, given these premises.\n\nIn logic, the structure of the argument is as follows:\n\n- Premise: A \u2192 B\n- Premise: B\n- Conclusion: A\n\nThis structure is an example of affirming the consequent, a logical fallacy. Just because B is true, it doesn't necessarily mean A is true. There could be other reasons why B is true that have nothing to do with A. For example, the book could be a mystery novel written by another author.\n\nTherefore, it does not logically follow that \"The book was written by James\" is true based solely on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
