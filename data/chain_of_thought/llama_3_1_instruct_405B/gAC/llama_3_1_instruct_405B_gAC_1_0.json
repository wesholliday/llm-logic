It does not guarantee Mary's presence if Sue is present. The statement \"Sue was at the wedding\" being true does not necessarily imply that Mary was at the wedding because Sue could have been at the wedding without Mary. The conditional statement only provides information about the implication in one direction (from Mary's presence to Sue's presence), not the reverse.\n\nAnswer: no",
