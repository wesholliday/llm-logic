            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The package must have been delivered today' from 'The package must have been delivered today and signed for', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statement. The original statement is a conjunction, meaning it contains two clauses ('The package must have been delivered today' and 'signed for') joined by 'and'. For a conjunction to be true, both clauses must be true. Therefore, if the package must have been delivered today and signed for, it logically follows that the package must have been delivered today, as this is one of the required conditions.\n\nAnswer: yes",
