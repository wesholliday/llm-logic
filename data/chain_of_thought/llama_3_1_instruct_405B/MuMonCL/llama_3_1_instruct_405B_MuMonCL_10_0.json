The original statement is \"The document must have been signed and notarized.\" This statement requires two conditions to be met: the document must be signed, and it must be notarized. The inferred statement is \"The document must have been signed.\" Since the original statement explicitly includes the condition that the document must be signed as one of its requirements, we can logically infer that if the document must have been signed and notarized, then it must have been signed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
