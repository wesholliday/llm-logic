            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The concert must have been sold out' from the given statement 'The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statement. The statement is a conjunction, meaning it is composed of two clauses ('The concert must have been sold out' and 'started at 8 PM') joined by 'and'. In a conjunction, both clauses must be true for the entire statement to be true. Therefore, if the entire statement is true, it logically follows that each individual clause is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
