            "content": "Explanation: To answer this question, we need to analyze the given statement and the statement we are trying to infer. The original statement is 'The room must have been cleaned daily and had fresh towels'. This is a compound statement connected by 'and', which means both conditions must be true for the entire statement to be true. The statement we are trying to infer is 'The room must have been cleaned daily'. This statement is one part of the original compound statement.\n\nSince the original statement requires both conditions to be true (the room being cleaned daily and having fresh towels), we can logically infer that if the entire statement is true, then each part of it must also be true. Therefore, if 'The room must have been cleaned daily and had fresh towels' is true, it logically follows that 'The room must have been cleaned daily' is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
