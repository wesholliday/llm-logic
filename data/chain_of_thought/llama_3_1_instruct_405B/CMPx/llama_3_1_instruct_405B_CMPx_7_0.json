    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crastin, a nivet, and a jomial are the top bispets this breeding season. Breeders expect the crastin likely will birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, with the jomial birthing many fewer. These lead in birthing, so if the nivet doesn\u2019t birth the most offspring, then if the crastin doesn\u2019t, the jomial will. Moreover, the crastin likely will lead births and hence the nivet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the crastin doesn\u2019t lead births, the jomial will?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the information given. We have three statements: \n1. The crastin is expected to birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, and then the jomial.\n2. If the nivet doesn't birth the most offspring, then if the crastin doesn't, the jomial will.\n3. The crastin likely will lead births, so the nivet likely won't.\n\nFrom statement 1, we understand the expected order of birthing. Statement 2 provides a conditional scenario that if the nivet and crastin don't lead, the jomial will. Statement 3 reinforces the likelihood of the crastin leading and thus the nivet not leading.\n\nThe question asks if it follows that it's likely that, if the crastin doesn\u2019t lead births, the jomial will. Given the conditional scenario in statement 2, if the crastin doesn't lead, the condition for the jomial to lead is that the nivet also doesn't lead. However, statement 3 suggests the crastin is likely to lead, which doesn't directly address the scenario where the crastin doesn't lead but implies a specific outcome (crastin leading) is likely, thus not necessarily making the jomial leading likely if the crastin doesn't.\n\nHowever, the logic puzzle here hinges on understanding that if the crastin doesn't lead (which is less likely but considered), and given the nivet is less likely to lead than the crastin, the condition for the jomial to lead (both crastin and nivet not leading) could indeed make it likely for the jomial to lead in the scenario where the crastin doesn't, because the premise sets up a specific order and expectation that if the first two don't meet the expectation, the third is the next in line.\n\nAnswer: yes",
