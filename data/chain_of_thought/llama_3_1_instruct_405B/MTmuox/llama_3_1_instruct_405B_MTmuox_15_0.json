            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is \"It's not the case that the dreb must have been spened.\" This can be translated into a logical statement as \u00ac(dreb must have been spened), where \u00ac denotes negation. This means that it is not necessary or it is not the case that the dreb was spened.\n\n2. The second statement is \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened.\" This can be translated into a logical statement as (dreb was vroombed) \u2192 (dreb must have been spened), where \u2192 denotes implication. This means that if the dreb was indeed vroombed, then it necessarily follows that the dreb was spened.\n\n3. To infer \"The dreb was not vroombed,\" we need to see if the given statements logically lead to this conclusion. \n\nGiven the first statement that it's not the case that the dreb must have been spened and the second statement that if the dreb was vroombed then it must have been spened, we can infer that since it's not the case that the dreb must have been spened, the condition for the dreb being vroombed (which necessitates spening) is not met. Therefore, logically, we can conclude that the dreb was not vroombed because if it were, it would contradict the given information that it's not the case that the dreb must have been spened.\n\nAnswer: yes",
