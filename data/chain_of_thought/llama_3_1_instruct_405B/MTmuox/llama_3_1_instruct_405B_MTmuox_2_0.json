The second statement sets up a condition where if the wug was flooped, then it must have bimmed the zoint. \n\nGiven that we know the wug did not necessarily bim the zoint, if being flooped necessitates bimming the zoint, then the wug could not have been flooped because that would contradict the first statement. This is a classic application of modus tollens, a rule of inference in logic. Modus tollens states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"not Q\", we can infer \"not P\".\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can logically infer that the wug was not flooped because if it were, it must have bimmed the zoint, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
