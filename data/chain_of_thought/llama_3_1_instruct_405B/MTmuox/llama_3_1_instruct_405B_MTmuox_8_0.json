            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled\" can be translated into a logical statement as \u00ac(the sprocket must have been daggled), where \"\u00ac\" denotes negation. This implies that there is no necessity for the sprocket to have been daggled; it doesn't have to be true that the sprocket was daggled.\n\n2. \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled\" can be translated into a logical statement as (the sprocket was cranked) \u2192 (the sprocket must have been daggled), where \"\u2192\" denotes implication. This statement establishes a condition where if the sprocket was cranked, then it necessarily follows that the sprocket must have been daggled.\n\nNow, combining these two statements, we can infer the following:\n\n- If being cranked implies that the sprocket must have been daggled (as per the second statement),\n- And it's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled (as per the first statement),\n- Then, logically, the condition that leads to the necessity of the sprocket being daggled (i.e., being cranked) cannot have occurred.\n\nThis is because if the sprocket was indeed cranked, it would contradict the first statement by necessitating that the sprocket must have been daggled, which is stated not to be the case. Therefore, to maintain logical consistency, we must conclude that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
