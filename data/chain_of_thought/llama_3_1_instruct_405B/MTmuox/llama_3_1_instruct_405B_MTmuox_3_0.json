            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the splat must have quanked\" can be translated into a more formal logical expression as \"\u00ac(The splat must have quanked)\", where \"\u00ac\" denotes negation. This statement implies that there is no necessity for the splat to have quanked; it doesn't have to have happened.\n\n2. \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked\" can be translated into a conditional statement as \"The splat was morphed \u2192 The splat must have quanked\". This statement establishes a relationship where if the first condition (the splat being morphed) is true, then the second condition (the splat must have quanked) must also be true.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can use a form of argument known as modus tollens, which states that if we have \"A \u2192 B\" and \"\u00acB\", we can infer \"\u00acA\".\n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements:\n- We have \"The splat was morphed \u2192 The splat must have quanked\" (A \u2192 B).\n- And we have \"\u00ac(The splat must have quanked)\" (\u00acB).\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"\u00ac(The splat was morphed)\", which translates to \"The splat was not morphed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
