            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into a logical form. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\" This can be represented as \"Bear in cave \u2192 Wolf in den.\" The second statement is a negation: \"The wolf was not in the den,\" which can be represented as \"Not (Wolf in den).\" \n\nWe are asked to infer whether \"The bear was not in the cave,\" which is \"Not (Bear in cave),\" follows logically from these two statements.\n\nUsing the rules of logical inference, specifically modus tollens, which states that from \"P \u2192 Q\" and \"Not Q,\" we can infer \"Not P,\" we can apply this rule directly to our problem.\n\nGiven \"Bear in cave \u2192 Wolf in den\" and \"Not (Wolf in den),\" applying modus tollens allows us to infer \"Not (Bear in cave),\" which translates to \"The bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nTherefore, the inference is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
