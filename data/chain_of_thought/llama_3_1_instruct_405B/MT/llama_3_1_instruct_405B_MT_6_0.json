            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements and apply logical reasoning. The first statement is \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This is a conditional statement where the choice of pizza by Sue is the condition (or antecedent) for Bob choosing pasta (the consequent). The second statement is \"Bob did not choose pasta,\" which directly negates the consequent of the first statement.\n\nGiven the structure of the conditional statement (If A, then B), if the consequent (B) is false, we can infer that the antecedent (A) must also be false for the conditional statement to hold true. This is because if A were true, B would have to be true according to the conditional statement, but we know B is false.\n\nTherefore, if Bob did not choose pasta (B is false), and the conditional statement is true, then Sue did not choose pizza (A must be false) because if she had, Bob would have chosen pasta according to the given conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
