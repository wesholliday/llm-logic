            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into logical expressions. Let V represent \"the vampire was awake\" and M represent \"the mummy was awake\". The first statement, \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake,\" can be represented as V \u2192 M. The second statement, \"The mummy was not awake,\" is represented as \u00acM (not M).\n\nGiven these, we want to determine if we can infer \"The vampire was not awake,\" which would be represented as \u00acV.\n\nUsing the first statement V \u2192 M and the second statement \u00acM, we can apply a logical rule known as modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if we have V \u2192 M and \u00acM, we can infer \u00acV.\n\nTherefore, applying modus tollens to our statements, we can infer that if the mummy was not awake (\u00acM), given that if the vampire was awake then the mummy was awake (V \u2192 M), it logically follows that the vampire was not awake (\u00acV).\n\nAnswer: yes",
