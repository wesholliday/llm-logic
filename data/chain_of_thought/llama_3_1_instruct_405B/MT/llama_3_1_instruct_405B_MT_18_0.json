            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into a logical form. The first statement is \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This can be represented as \"Doll is plastic \u2192 Truck is metal.\" The second statement is \"The truck was not metal.\" \n\nUsing the first statement, we are given a condition that leads to the truck being metal (the doll being plastic). However, we know from the second statement that the truck is not metal. This means the condition that leads to the truck being metal (the doll being plastic) cannot be true because it contradicts the fact that the truck is not metal.\n\nIn logical terms, if A \u2192 B and B is false, then A must be false for the statement to hold true without contradiction. Therefore, if \"Doll is plastic \u2192 Truck is metal\" and \"Truck is not metal,\" then \"Doll is not plastic\" must be true to avoid contradiction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
