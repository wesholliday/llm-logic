            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into a logical form. The first statement is \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This can be represented as \"Cake is chocolate \u2192 Muffins are blueberry.\" The second statement is \"The muffins were not blueberry,\" which directly negates the outcome of the first statement.\n\nIn logic, when we have a statement of the form \"If A, then B\" (A \u2192 B), and we find out that B is not true, we can infer that A is not true because the condition for B to be true (which is A) did not lead to a true outcome. This is based on the principle of modus tollens, which states that if we have A \u2192 B and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A is false.\n\nApplying this to our scenario, since we know the muffins were not blueberry (B is false), we can infer that the condition leading to the muffins being blueberry (the cake being chocolate) did not occur. Therefore, we can logically conclude that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
