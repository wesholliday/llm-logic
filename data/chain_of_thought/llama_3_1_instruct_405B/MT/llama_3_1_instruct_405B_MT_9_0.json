            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the information given into logical statements and analyze the conclusion that can be drawn from them.\n\n1. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as: If L, then M (where L = Lisa bought the red shirt, and M = Mark bought the blue shirt).\n2. \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as: Not M.\n\nFrom the first statement, we understand that the action of Lisa buying the red shirt (L) leads to Mark buying the blue shirt (M). However, from the second statement, we know that Mark did not buy the blue shirt (Not M).\n\nGiven that the outcome (M) did not occur, we can infer that the condition (L) that leads to this outcome also did not occur. This is because in a logical \"if-then\" statement, if the \"then\" part is false, we can conclude that the \"if\" part is also false, given that the statement is the only condition under which the \"then\" part would be true.\n\nTherefore, since Mark did not buy the blue shirt, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, because if she had, Mark would have bought the blue shirt according to the given condition.\n\nAnswer: yes",
