            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements and apply logical reasoning. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be represented as \"A \u2192 B,\" where A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana was yellow.\" The second statement is \"The banana was not yellow,\" which can be represented as \"\u00acB\" (not B).\n\nFrom the conditional statement, we know that if A is true, then B must be true. However, we are given that B is false (the banana was not yellow). This situation does not directly tell us the truth value of A (whether the apple was red or not), but it does tell us that the condition \"if A then B\" was not fulfilled in the way that would make B true.\n\nIn classical logic, from \"A \u2192 B\" and \"\u00acB,\" we can infer \"\u00acA\" through a process called modus tollens. Modus tollens is a rule of logic that states if we have \"A \u2192 B\" and \"\u00acB,\" we can conclude \"\u00acA.\" This is because if B is false, and A would make B true if A were true, then A must be false to avoid contradicting the known state of B.\n\nTherefore, applying modus tollens to our statements, from \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" and \"The banana was not yellow,\" we can logically infer \"The apple was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
