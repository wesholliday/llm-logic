            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into a logical form. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be represented as \"Joe went to the park \u2192 Lucy went to the zoo.\" The second statement is \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\" \n\nIn logical terms, if we have \"A \u2192 B\" and we know \"not B,\" we can infer \"not A\" through a process called modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument in logic. It states that if we have a conditional statement (\"if A then B\") and we know the consequent (B) is false, we can conclude the antecedent (A) is also false.\n\nApplying this to our scenario, since we know Lucy did not go to the zoo (not B), and we have the conditional statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" (A \u2192 B), we can infer that Joe did not go to the park (not A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
