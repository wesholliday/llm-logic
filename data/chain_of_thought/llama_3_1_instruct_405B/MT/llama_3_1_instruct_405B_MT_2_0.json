            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into logical expressions. Let G represent \"The griffin was in the forest\" and U represent \"The unicorn was in the forest\". The first statement, \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest,\" can be represented as G \u2192 U. The second statement, \"The unicorn was not in the forest,\" can be represented as \u00acU (not U).\n\nFrom the first statement, G \u2192 U, we can infer that if G is true, then U must also be true. However, we are given that U is false (\u00acU). Using the principle of modus tollens, which states that if we have G \u2192 U and \u00acU, we can conclude \u00acG, we can infer that G must be false because U is false.\n\nTherefore, if the unicorn was not in the forest, and the presence of the griffin in the forest necessitates the presence of the unicorn, then logically, the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
