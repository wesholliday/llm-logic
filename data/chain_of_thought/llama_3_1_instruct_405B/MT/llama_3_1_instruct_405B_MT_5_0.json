            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into logical premises and then apply basic rules of inference.\n\n1. The first statement is \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be represented as \"Jeff played basketball \u2192 Amy played tennis.\"\n2. The second statement is \"Amy did not play tennis.\"\n\nFrom these premises, we can use the rule of contrapositive inference, which states that if we have \"A \u2192 B\" and \"not B,\" we can infer \"not A.\"\n\nApplying this rule:\n- \"Jeff played basketball \u2192 Amy played tennis\" is our \"A \u2192 B.\"\n- \"Amy did not play tennis\" gives us \"not B.\"\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can infer \"not A,\" which in this context means \"Jeff did not play basketball.\"\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can logically infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
