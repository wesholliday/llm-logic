            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements and apply logical reasoning. The first statement is \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This is a conditional statement in the form of \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the car was red\" and B is \"the truck was blue.\" The second statement is \"The truck was not blue,\" which directly negates the consequence (B) of the first statement.\n\nGiven the structure of the conditional statement, if we know the consequence (B) is false, we can infer that the antecedent (A) must also be false because the conditional statement only guarantees the truth of B if A is true. If B is false, it implies A cannot be true because if A were true, B would have to be true according to the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, knowing the truck was not blue (B is false) allows us to infer that the car was not red (A is false) because if the car were red, the conditional statement would require the truck to be blue, which contradicts the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
