            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into logical expressions. Let A represent \"Alex finished the race\" and C represent \"Chris finished the race\". The first statement, \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race,\" can be represented as A \u2192 C. The second statement, \"Chris did not finish the race,\" is represented as \u00acC (not C).\n\nGiven A \u2192 C and \u00acC, we want to determine if we can infer \u00acA (Alex did not finish the race).\n\nIn logic, the rule of contrapositive states that from A \u2192 C, we can infer \u00acC \u2192 \u00acA. Given we have \u00acC, we can use this rule to infer \u00acA.\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" and \"Chris did not finish the race,\" we can logically infer \"Alex did not finish the race.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
