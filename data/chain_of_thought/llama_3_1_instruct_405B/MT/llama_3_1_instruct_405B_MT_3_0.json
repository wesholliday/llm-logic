            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step. The first statement is \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This is a conditional statement in the form of \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the book was written by James\" and B is \"the book is a mystery novel.\" The second statement is \"The book is not a mystery novel,\" which directly negates B.\n\nTo infer \"The book was not written by James\" from these statements, we need to apply the rule of contrapositive inference, which states that if we have \"If A, then B\" and we know \"not B,\" we can conclude \"not A.\" In this context, knowing the book is not a mystery novel (not B) allows us to infer that the book was not written by James (not A), given the conditional relationship between these statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
