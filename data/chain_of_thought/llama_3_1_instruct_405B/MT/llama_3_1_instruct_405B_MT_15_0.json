            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into a logical argument. The first statement is \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This can be represented as \"Sam took a plane \u2192 Erin took a train.\" The second statement is \"Erin did not take a train.\" \n\nFrom the first statement, we understand that Sam taking a plane is a condition that, if true, leads to Erin taking a train. However, from the second statement, we know that Erin did not take a train. This means the outcome that would validate the condition (Sam taking a plane leading to Erin taking a train) did not occur.\n\nGiven the structure of the conditional statement, if the consequent (Erin took a train) is false, and we are to maintain the truth of the conditional statement as a whole, the antecedent (Sam took a plane) must also be false. This is because a conditional statement is only false when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. Therefore, for the conditional to hold true, given Erin did not take a train, Sam must not have taken a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
