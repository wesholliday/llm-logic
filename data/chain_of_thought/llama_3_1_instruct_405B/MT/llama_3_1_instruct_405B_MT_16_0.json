            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into a logical form. The first statement is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This can be represented as \"Cotton shirt \u2192 Denim pants.\" The second statement is \"The pants were not denim,\" which directly negates the outcome of the first statement.\n\nIn logic, when we have a statement of the form \"If A, then B\" (A \u2192 B), and we find out that B is not true, we can infer that A cannot be true because if A were true, B would have to be true according to the initial statement. This is based on the principle of modus tollens, which states that if we have A \u2192 B and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A is false.\n\nApplying this to our scenario, since we know the pants were not denim (B is false), we can infer that the condition leading to this outcome (the shirt being cotton, A) must also be false, because if the shirt were cotton, the pants would have to be denim according to the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer that the shirt was not cotton based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
