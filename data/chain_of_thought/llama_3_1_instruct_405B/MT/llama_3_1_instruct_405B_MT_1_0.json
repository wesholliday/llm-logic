            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements and apply logical reasoning. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be represented as \"Mary \u2192 Sue.\" The second statement is \"Sue was not at the wedding,\" which we can represent as \"\u00acSue\" (not Sue). \n\nWe are trying to determine if we can infer \"Mary was not at the wedding\" (\u00acMary) from these statements.\n\nUsing the rules of logical inference, specifically modus tollens, which states that from \"P \u2192 Q\" and \"\u00acQ\" we can infer \"\u00acP,\" we can apply this rule directly to our problem. \n\nGiven \"Mary \u2192 Sue\" and \"\u00acSue,\" applying modus tollens allows us to infer \"\u00acMary\" (Mary was not at the wedding).\n\nAnswer: yes",
