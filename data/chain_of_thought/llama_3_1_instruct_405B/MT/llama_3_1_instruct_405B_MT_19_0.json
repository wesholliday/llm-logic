            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into a logical argument. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This can be represented as \"Tom watched football \u2192 Jen watched basketball.\" The second statement is \"Jen did not watch basketball.\" From these two statements, we are trying to infer whether \"Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nIn logical terms, if we have \"A \u2192 B\" and we know \"not B,\" we can infer \"not A\" through a process called modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument in logic. Here, \"A\" represents \"Tom watched football\" and \"B\" represents \"Jen watched basketball.\" Given that we know Jen did not watch basketball (not B), we can use modus tollens to conclude that Tom did not watch football (not A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
