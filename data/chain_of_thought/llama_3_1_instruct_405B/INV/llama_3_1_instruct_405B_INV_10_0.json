The inference we are considering is of the form \"If not A, then not B\" (If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside).\n\nIn logic, the original statement \"If A, then B\" does not necessarily imply \"If not A, then not B.\" The latter is a form of argument known as \"denying the antecedent,\" which is a logical fallacy. The correct logical inference from \"If A, then B\" would be \"If not B, then not A\" (a form of argument known as \"modus tollens\"), not \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside\" from \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
