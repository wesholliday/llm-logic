            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow' from 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow', we need to examine the logical structure of the statements. The original statement is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B', where A is 'the apple was red' and B is 'the banana was yellow'. The inference we are asked to consider is the contrapositive of the original statement, but in a negated form, essentially asking if the absence of A implies the absence of B.\n\nHowever, the original statement only guarantees that if A is true, then B is true. It does not provide information about the relationship between A and B when A is false. The contrapositive of the original statement would be 'If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red', which is logically equivalent to the original statement. But the statement we are asked to infer is the inverse of the original statement, not the contrapositive, and the inverse of a conditional statement does not logically follow from the statement itself without additional information.\n\nTherefore, without additional premises, we cannot logically infer 'If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow' from 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'.\n\nAnswer: no",
