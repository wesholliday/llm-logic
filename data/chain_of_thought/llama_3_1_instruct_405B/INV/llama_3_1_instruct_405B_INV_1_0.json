            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" implies a relationship where Mary's presence guarantees Sue's presence, but it does not necessarily imply that Sue's presence is dependent solely on Mary's presence. There could be other conditions under which Sue would be at the wedding even if Mary is not. The statement does not provide enough information to conclude that Sue's absence is guaranteed by Mary's absence. This is a classic case of attempting to infer the inverse from the original conditional statement, which is not logically valid without additional information.\n\nAnswer: no",
