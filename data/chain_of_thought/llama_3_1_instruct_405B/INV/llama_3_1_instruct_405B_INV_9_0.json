            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements. The first statement is of the form \"If A, then B\" (If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt). The second statement is of the form \"If not A, then not B\" (If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt). In logic, the second form is known as the contrapositive of the first form. However, the correct contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is actually \"If not B, then not A\", not \"If not A, then not B\". The statement \"If not A, then not B\" is logically distinct and cannot be inferred directly from \"If A, then B\" without additional information. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
