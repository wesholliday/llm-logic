The inference we're considering is of the form \"If not A, then not B\" (If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim). This is essentially asking whether the original statement's converse is logically equivalent or can be inferred from the original statement.\n\nIn classical logic, the original statement \"If A, then B\" does not logically imply its converse, \"If B, then A,\" nor does it imply \"If not A, then not B.\" The statement \"If A, then B\" only guarantees that if A is true, B must also be true. It does not provide information about the truth of B when A is false. Therefore, from \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim,\" we cannot logically infer \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim\" because the original statement does not provide any information about the material of the pants when the shirt is not cotton.\n\nAnswer: no",
