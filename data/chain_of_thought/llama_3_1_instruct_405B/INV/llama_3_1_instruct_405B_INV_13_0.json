            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue' from 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue', we need to examine the logical structure of the statements. The original statement is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B', where A is 'the car was red' and B is 'the truck was blue'. The statement we are trying to infer is the inverse of the original statement, which is of the form 'If not A, then not B'. However, the inverse of a conditional statement does not logically follow from the original statement. The original statement only tells us what happens if the car was red; it does not provide information about what happens if the car was not red. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the inverse statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
