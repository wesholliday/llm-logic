            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B\" where A is \"the splat was morphed\" and B is \"the splat must have quanked\". This statement implies that if A is true, then B must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement, \"It's not the case that the splat must have quanked\", directly negates the consequence (B) of the first statement. This means B is false.\n\n3. Since the first statement requires that if A is true, B must also be true, and we know B is false, we can infer that A must be false. This is because if A were true, B would have to be true as well, which contradicts the information given in the second statement.\n\nTherefore, if the splat being morphed necessitates it having quanked, and it's established that it didn't quank, logically, the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
