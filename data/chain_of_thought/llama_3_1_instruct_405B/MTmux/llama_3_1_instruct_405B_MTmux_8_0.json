            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements into logical form. The first statement, \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled,\" can be represented as \"C \u2192 D,\" where C stands for \"the sprocket was cranked\" and D stands for \"the sprocket must have been daggled.\" The second statement, \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled,\" can be represented as \"\u00acD,\" where \u00ac denotes negation.\n\nTo infer \"The sprocket was not cranked\" (\u00acC) from these statements, we can use the rule of contrapositive inference, which states that from \"A \u2192 B\" and \"\u00acB,\" we can infer \"\u00acA.\" Applying this rule to our statements, from \"C \u2192 D\" and \"\u00acD,\" we can infer \"\u00acC.\"\n\nTherefore, logically, if we have the statements \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled\" and \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled,\" we can indeed infer \"The sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
