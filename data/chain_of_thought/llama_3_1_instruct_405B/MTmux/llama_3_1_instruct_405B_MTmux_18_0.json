            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into logical terms. The first statement is \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged.\" This can be represented as \"P \u2192 N,\" where P stands for \"the shank was plooked\" and N stands for \"the shank must have been nugged.\" The second statement is \"It's not the case that the shank must have been nugged,\" which can be represented as \"\u00acN\" (not N).\n\nIn logic, the rule of contrapositive states that from \"P \u2192 Q\" we can infer \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP.\" Applying this rule to our first statement, we get \"\u00acN \u2192 \u00acP,\" meaning \"If it's not the case that the shank must have been nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\"\n\nGiven the second statement \"\u00acN\" (it's not the case that the shank must have been nugged), we can use the contrapositive we derived from the first statement to conclude \"\u00acP\" (the shank was not plooked).\n\nAnswer: yes",
