            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened.\" This is a conditional statement in the form of \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and B is \"the dreb must have been spened.\" This statement implies that if the condition of the dreb being vroombed is true, then it necessarily follows that the dreb must have been spened.\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the dreb must have been spened.\" This statement negates the conclusion of the first statement, saying that it is not necessary that the dreb must have been spened.\n\n3. To infer \"The dreb was not vroombed\" from these statements, we need to see if the negation of the conclusion of the first statement (it's not the case that the dreb must have been spened) logically leads to the negation of the condition (the dreb was not vroombed).\n\n4. The form of the argument we are examining is a type of argument known as modus tollens, which is logically valid. Modus tollens states that if we have \"If A, then B\" and \"not B,\" we can logically conclude \"not A.\"\n\n5. Applying modus tollens to our statements: We have \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened\" (If A, then B) and \"It's not the case that the dreb must have been spened\" (not B). Following the logic of modus tollens, we can conclude \"The dreb was not vroombed\" (not A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
