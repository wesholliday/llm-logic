            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements into logical form. The first statement \"If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled\" can be represented as \"S \u2192 G\", where S represents \"the wug was sproinged\" and G represents \"the wug must have been garpled\". The second statement \"It's not the case that the wug must have been garpled\" can be represented as \"\u00acG\", where \u00ac denotes negation.\n\nTo infer \"The wug was not sproinged\" (\u00acS) from these statements, we need to apply a logical rule. The appropriate rule here is Modus Tollens, which states that from \"A \u2192 B\" and \"\u00acB\", we can infer \"\u00acA\".\n\nApplying Modus Tollens to our statements, from \"S \u2192 G\" and \"\u00acG\", we can indeed infer \"\u00acS\", which means \"The wug was not sproinged\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
