            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into logical form. The first statement is \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink.\" This can be represented as \"A \u2192 B\" where A is \"the sneg was crampled\" and B is \"the sneg must have sproted the frink.\" The second statement is \"It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink,\" which can be represented as \"\u00acB\" (not B).\n\nGiven these, we are trying to infer \"The sneg was not crampled,\" which is \"\u00acA\" (not A).\n\nUsing the rules of logical inference, specifically modus tollens, which states that from \"A \u2192 B\" and \"\u00acB\" we can infer \"\u00acA\", we can apply this rule directly to our problem.\n\nGiven \"A \u2192 B\" (If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink) and \"\u00acB\" (It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink), we can infer \"\u00acA\" (The sneg was not crampled).\n\nAnswer: yes",
