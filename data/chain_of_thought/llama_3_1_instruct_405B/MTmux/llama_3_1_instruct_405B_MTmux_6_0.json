            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into logical terms. The first statement is \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink.\" This can be represented as \"A \u2192 B,\" where A is \"the grommet was sploffed\" and B is \"the grommet must have plopped the frink.\" The second statement is \"It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink,\" which can be represented as \"\u00acB\" (not B).\n\nIn logic, the rule of contrapositive states that if we have \"A \u2192 B,\" then we can infer \"\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA\" (if not B, then not A). Given that we have \"A \u2192 B\" and \"\u00acB,\" we can use the contrapositive rule to infer \"\u00acA\" (not A), which translates to \"The grommet was not sploffed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
