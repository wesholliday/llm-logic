Let's denote \"the whiffle was shanked\" as S, and \"the whiffle must have tinked\" as T.\n\n1. The first statement is \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked,\" which can be expressed as S \u2192 T (if S, then T).\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have tinked,\" which can be expressed as \u00acT (not T).\n\nWe are trying to infer \"The whiffle was not shanked,\" which is \u00acS (not S).\n\nUsing the rules of logical inference, specifically modus tollens, which states that from (P \u2192 Q) and \u00acQ, we can infer \u00acP, we can apply this rule to our statements:\n\n- We have S \u2192 T (if the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked) as our P \u2192 Q.\n- We have \u00acT (it's not the case that the whiffle must have tinked) as our \u00acQ.\n\nApplying modus tollens, we can infer \u00acS (the whiffle was not shanked).\n\nAnswer: yes",
