            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into logical form. The first statement is \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked.\" This can be represented as \"Snurgled \u2192 Crinked.\" The second statement is \"It's not the case that the fribble must have crinked,\" which can be represented as \"\u00acCrinked\" (not Crinked).\n\nUsing these representations, we can apply basic rules of logic to determine if we can infer \"The fribble was not snurgled\" (\u00acSnurgled) from the given statements.\n\nThe rule of logic that applies here is modus tollens, which states that if we have \"P \u2192 Q\" and \"\u00acQ,\" we can infer \"\u00acP.\" Applying this rule to our statements, we have \"Snurgled \u2192 Crinked\" and \"\u00acCrinked,\" so we can infer \"\u00acSnurgled\" (The fribble was not snurgled).\n\nAnswer: yes",
