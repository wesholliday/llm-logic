The original statement specifies an action or requirement for 'the wibble', which is to 'wibble fribble zizz'. The inferred statement adds a new action ('blimp zibble plimp') in addition to the original action ('wibble fribble zizz'). However, there is no logical connection or information provided in the original statement that necessitates or implies the additional action of 'blimp zibble plimp'. The original statement does not provide any basis for adding new actions or requirements beyond 'wibble fribble zizz'.\n\nAnswer: no",
