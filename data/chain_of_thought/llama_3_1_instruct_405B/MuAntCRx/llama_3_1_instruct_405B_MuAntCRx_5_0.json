The original statement only mentions the necessity of the plonk being 'shimble for', without providing any information about 'zibber for'. There is no logical or semantic connection provided between 'shimble for' and 'zibber for' that would allow us to infer the additional requirement of 'zibber for' based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
