            "content": "Explanation: To assess the logical validity of the argument, let's break down the premises and the conclusion. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This can be represented as \"M \u2192 S\" where M stands for \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S stands for \"Sue was at the wedding.\" The second premise is \"Sue might not have been at the wedding,\" which can be represented as \"\u00acS\" (not S) is possible. The conclusion is \"Mary was not at the wedding,\" which can be represented as \"\u00acM.\"\n\nThe argument form is:\n1. M \u2192 S\n2. Possibly \u00acS\nConclusion: \u00acM\n\nFor an argument to be logically valid, it must be impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false at the same time. However, the second premise only states a possibility and does not definitively assert that Sue was not at the wedding. It leaves open the possibility that Sue was at the wedding, which would not contradict the first premise if Mary was also at the wedding. Therefore, the premises do not necessarily lead to the conclusion that Mary was not at the wedding. The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises because the second premise does not provide a strong enough assertion to negate the conditional in the first premise completely.\n\nAnswer: no",
