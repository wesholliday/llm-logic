            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. The premise is \"If the job was completed, then it was not completed well,\" which can be symbolized as \"C \u2192 \u00acW\" (where C represents \"the job was completed\" and W represents \"the job was completed well\"). The conclusion is \"If the job was completed well, then it was not completed,\" which can be symbolized as \"W \u2192 \u00acC\".\n\nWe can use a truth table or logical rules to evaluate the validity of the argument. However, a quicker approach is to recognize the form of the argument as a contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"P \u2192 Q\" is \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\", and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nGiven the premise \"C \u2192 \u00acW\", its contrapositive would be \"W \u2192 \u00acC\", which is exactly the conclusion. Since the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and the contrapositive is a logically equivalent form, the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise, making the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
