            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. The premise is \"If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice,\" which can be symbolized as \"A \u2192 \u00acH\" (where A represents \"advice was offered\" and H represents \"helpful advice was offered\"). The conclusion is \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered,\" which can be symbolized as \"H \u2192 \u00acA.\"\n\nWe can analyze the argument by constructing a truth table or by applying logical rules. A key rule to apply here is the contrapositive, which states that \"A \u2192 B\" is logically equivalent to \"\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA.\" However, the argument in question seems to be attempting a different manipulation.\n\nThe premise A \u2192 \u00acH does logically imply its contrapositive, which would be \u00ac(\u00acH) \u2192 \u00acA, simplifying to H \u2192 \u00acA. This matches the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does logically follow from the premise, making the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
