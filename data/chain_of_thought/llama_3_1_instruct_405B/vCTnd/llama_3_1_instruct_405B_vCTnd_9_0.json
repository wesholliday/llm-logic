            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. The premise is given as \"If instructions were given, then they were not explained clearly,\" which can be symbolized as \"G \u2192 \u00acE\" (where G represents \"instructions were given\" and E represents \"instructions were explained clearly\"). The conclusion is \"If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given,\" which can be symbolized as \"E \u2192 \u00acG.\"\n\nWe can use a truth table or logical rules to assess the validity. However, a quicker approach is to recognize the form of the argument. The premise is of the form \"P \u2192 \u00acQ,\" and the conclusion is of the form \"Q \u2192 \u00acP.\" These forms are logically equivalent by the principle of contrapositive inference, which states that \"P \u2192 Q\" is logically equivalent to \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP.\" However, the direct application here requires recognizing that the given premise and conclusion are essentially contrapositives of each other but with the negations already included in the original statements.\n\nGiven this, the argument is essentially presenting two logically equivalent statements, one as the premise and the other as the conclusion. Since the conclusion logically follows from the premise by virtue of being its logical equivalent, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
