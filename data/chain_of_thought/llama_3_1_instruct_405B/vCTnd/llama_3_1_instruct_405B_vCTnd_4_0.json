            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. The premise is given as \"If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently,\" which can be symbolized as \"S \u2192 \u00acD\" (where S represents \"Ben studied\" and D represents \"Ben studied diligently\"). The conclusion is \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study,\" which can be symbolized as \"D \u2192 \u00acS\".\n\nWe can use a truth table to check the validity of the argument by examining all possible combinations of truth values for S and D and seeing if there's any situation where the premise is true but the conclusion is false.\n\nHowever, a quicker approach is to recognize the form of the argument. The premise is of the form \"If P, then not Q,\" and the conclusion is of the form \"If Q, then not P.\" This is a form of argument known as \"contrapositive,\" but slightly adjusted. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" Here, we have a variation that involves the negation of the original statements in a different arrangement.\n\nThe argument form is valid because if studying leads to not studying diligently, then it logically follows that studying diligently would mean not studying, as the premise sets up an opposition between studying and studying diligently. This opposition is preserved in the conclusion, making the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
