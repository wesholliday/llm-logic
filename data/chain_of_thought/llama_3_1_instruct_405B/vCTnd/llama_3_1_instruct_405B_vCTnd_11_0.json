            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. The premise is given as \"If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables,\" which can be symbolized as P \u2192 \u00acQ, where P represents \"I went to the store\" and Q represents \"I bought vegetables.\" The conclusion is \"If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store,\" which can be symbolized as Q \u2192 \u00acP. \n\nWe need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise, meaning we need to see if (P \u2192 \u00acQ) logically implies (Q \u2192 \u00acP). This is a matter of understanding the relationship between these two conditional statements.\n\nIn classical logic, the conditional statement P \u2192 Q is logically equivalent to its contrapositive, \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP. However, the relationship between P \u2192 \u00acQ and Q \u2192 \u00acP is one of being contrapositives of each other as well. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning they have the same truth conditions. Therefore, if P \u2192 \u00acQ is true, then its contrapositive, which is Q \u2192 \u00acP, must also be true.\n\nGiven this logical relationship, the conclusion \"If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store\" does logically follow from the premise \"If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
