            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. The premise is given as \"If I ate a meal, then I did not eat a large meal,\" which can be symbolized as \"M \u2192 \u00acL\" where M represents \"I ate a meal\" and L represents \"I ate a large meal.\" The conclusion is \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal,\" which can be symbolized as \"L \u2192 \u00acM.\"\n\nWe can analyze the logical validity of the argument by constructing a truth table for both the premise and the conclusion and checking if there is any situation where the premise is true but the conclusion is false. However, a quicker approach is to recognize the form of the argument and apply logical rules.\n\nThe argument form here resembles a contrapositive argument. The contrapositive of a statement \"A \u2192 B\" is \"\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA,\" and it is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, the argument in question is trying to conclude \"L \u2192 \u00acM\" from \"M \u2192 \u00acL,\" which looks like an attempt to assert the converse of the contrapositive, rather than the contrapositive itself.\n\nThe premise \"M \u2192 \u00acL\" does logically imply its contrapositive, which would be \"L \u2192 \u00acM\" (since the contrapositive of \"M \u2192 \u00acL\" is indeed \"L \u2192 \u00acM\"). This matches the conclusion. Therefore, the conclusion does logically follow from the premise, making the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
