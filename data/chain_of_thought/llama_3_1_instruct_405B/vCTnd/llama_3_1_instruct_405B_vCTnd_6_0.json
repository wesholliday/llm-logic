            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. The premise is \"If the clothes were washed, then they were not washed properly,\" which can be symbolized as \"W \u2192 \u00acP\" (where W represents \"the clothes were washed\" and P represents \"the clothes were washed properly\"). The conclusion is \"If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed,\" which can be symbolized as \"P \u2192 \u00acW\".\n\nWe can use a truth table or logical rules to evaluate the validity of the argument. However, a quicker approach is to recognize the form of the argument and apply the contrapositive rule. The contrapositive of \"W \u2192 \u00acP\" is \"P \u2192 \u00acW\", which matches the conclusion. Since the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
