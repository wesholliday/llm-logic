            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. The premise is \"If Jane studied, then she did not study long,\" which can be symbolized as \"S \u2192 \u00acL\" (where S represents \"Jane studied\" and L represents \"Jane studied long\"). The conclusion is \"If Jane studied long, then she did not study,\" which can be symbolized as \"L \u2192 \u00acS\".\n\nWe can use a truth table or logical rules to evaluate the argument's validity. However, a quicker approach is to recognize the form of the argument. The premise is in the form of a conditional statement, and the conclusion is the contrapositive of that statement. The contrapositive of \"S \u2192 \u00acL\" is indeed \"L \u2192 \u00acS\", which is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true, as they are logically equivalent statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
