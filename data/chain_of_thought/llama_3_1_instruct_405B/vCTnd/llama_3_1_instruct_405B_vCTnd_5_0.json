            "content": "Explanation: To determine the logical validity of the argument, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. The premise is \"If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly,\" which can be symbolized as \"C \u2192 \u00acT,\" where C represents \"the room was cleaned\" and T represents \"the room was cleaned thoroughly.\" The conclusion is \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned,\" which can be symbolized as \"T \u2192 \u00acC.\"\n\nWe can analyze the argument form by constructing a truth table or by applying logical rules. A logically valid argument is one where if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true. \n\nLooking at the premise C \u2192 \u00acT, we see it asserts that if C is true, then T must be false. The conclusion T \u2192 \u00acC asserts that if T is true, then C must be false. These two statements are logically equivalent because they both describe a situation where C and T cannot both be true at the same time. The premise effectively states that cleaning the room (C) and cleaning it thoroughly (T) are mutually exclusive events, which directly supports the conclusion that if the room was cleaned thoroughly (T), then it was not cleaned (C) in the sense implied by the premise.\n\nGiven this analysis, the argument form appears to be logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
