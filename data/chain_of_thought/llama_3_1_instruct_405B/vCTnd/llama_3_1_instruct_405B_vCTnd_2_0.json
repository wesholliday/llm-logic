            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. The premise is given as \"If Ann exercised, then she did not exercise strenuously,\" which can be symbolized as \"A \u2192 \u00acS\" where A represents \"Ann exercised\" and S represents \"she exercised strenuously.\" The conclusion is \"If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise,\" which can be symbolized as \"S \u2192 \u00acA.\"\n\nWe can use a truth table to check for validity, but first, let's analyze the structure. The argument form is essentially testing the relationship between the conditions of exercising and exercising strenuously and their negations. The premise suggests that exercising (A) implies not exercising strenuously (\u00acS), which inherently implies a relationship between A and S.\n\nHowever, the conclusion flips this relationship by stating that exercising strenuously (S) implies not exercising (\u00acA), which seems to logically follow because if exercising implies not doing it strenuously, then doing it strenuously should imply not exercising, given the initial condition sets up a mutual exclusion between exercising strenuously and exercising in the context of this argument.\n\nTo validate, we can check the truth table for both the premise and the conclusion or understand it through logical principles. The argument form seems to follow a pattern of modus tollens or a similar logical rule but applied in a conditional form that essentially states if A leads to not S, then S would logically lead to not A, assuming the conditions are set to be mutually exclusive in this context.\n\nGiven this analysis, the conclusion logically follows from the premise because it essentially states the contrapositive of the premise, which is a logically valid form of argument.\n\nAnswer: yes",
