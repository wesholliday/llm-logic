            "content": "Explanation: To determine the logical validity of the argument, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. The premise is \"If the issue was addressed, then it was not addressed effectively,\" which can be symbolized as \"A \u2192 \u00acE\" (where A stands for \"the issue was addressed\" and E stands for \"the issue was addressed effectively\"). The conclusion is \"If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed,\" which can be symbolized as \"E \u2192 \u00acA.\"\n\nWe can use a truth table or logical rules to assess the validity. However, a quicker approach is to recognize the form of the argument and apply logical principles. The premise asserts that if A, then not E. The conclusion asserts that if E, then not A. This is essentially a form of contrapositive reasoning, but we need to ensure that it logically follows.\n\nThe contrapositive of \"A \u2192 \u00acE\" is indeed \"E \u2192 \u00acA,\" because the contrapositive of a statement \"p \u2192 q\" is \"\u00acq \u2192 \u00acp.\" Since the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
