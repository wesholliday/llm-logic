            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. The premise is \"If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth,\" which can be symbolized as \"D \u2192 \u00acID\" (where D represents \"the issue was discussed\" and ID represents \"the issue was discussed in depth\"). The conclusion is \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed,\" which can be symbolized as \"ID \u2192 \u00acD\".\n\nWe can analyze the argument by constructing a truth table or by applying logical rules. A key rule here is the contrapositive, which states that a conditional statement \"P \u2192 Q\" is logically equivalent to \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\". Applying this rule to the premise, we get \"\u00ac\u00acID \u2192 \u00acD\", which simplifies to \"ID \u2192 \u00acD\". This matches the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premise, making the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
