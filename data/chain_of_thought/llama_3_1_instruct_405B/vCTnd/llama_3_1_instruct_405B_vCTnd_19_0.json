            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form. The premise is given as \"If directions were provided, then they were not explained clearly,\" which can be symbolized as P \u2192 \u00acE (where P represents \"directions were provided\" and E represents \"directions were explained clearly\"). The conclusion is \"If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided,\" which can be symbolized as E \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nThe argument form can thus be represented as:\nP \u2192 \u00acE\n\u2234 E \u2192 \u00acP\n\nThis form can be tested for validity by constructing a truth table or by applying logical rules. However, a quicker method is to recognize that this argument form resembles a known valid form, specifically the contrapositive form. The contrapositive of a conditional statement P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nGiven that the conclusion is essentially the contrapositive of the premise, and knowing that the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can conclude that the argument form is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
