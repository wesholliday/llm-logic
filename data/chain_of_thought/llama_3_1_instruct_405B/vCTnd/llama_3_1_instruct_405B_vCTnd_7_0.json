            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. The premise is given as \"If the customer was served, then he was not served promptly,\" which can be symbolized as \"S \u2192 \u00acP\" (where S stands for \"the customer was served\" and P stands for \"the customer was served promptly\"). The conclusion is \"If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served,\" which can be symbolized as \"P \u2192 \u00acS.\"\n\nWe can use a truth table to check the validity of the argument by examining all possible combinations of truth values for S and P and seeing if there's any situation where the premise is true but the conclusion is false.\n\nHowever, without needing to construct the truth table, we can recognize this as an example of the argument form known as \"modus tollens\" but applied in a slightly rearranged manner. The original modus tollens form is \"If P, then Q; not Q; therefore, not P.\" Here, our premise rearranges to fit a similar logical structure but deals with the negations and implications directly.\n\nGiven the premise S \u2192 \u00acP, we can logically infer its contrapositive, which is P \u2192 \u00acS. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning they have the same truth value in all possible worlds. Thus, if \"If the customer was served, then he was not served promptly\" is true, then \"If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served\" must also be true, as it is the contrapositive of the premise.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premise, making the argument form logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
