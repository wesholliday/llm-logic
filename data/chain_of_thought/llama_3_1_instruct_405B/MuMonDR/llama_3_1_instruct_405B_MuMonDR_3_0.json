            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The keys must be on the table or in the drawer' from 'The keys must be in the drawer', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements. The original statement 'The keys must be in the drawer' asserts a specific location for the keys, indicating they are definitely in the drawer. The inferred statement 'The keys must be on the table or in the drawer' offers two possible locations for the keys: on the table or in the drawer. Since the original statement confirms that the keys are indeed in the drawer, it logically supports one of the options presented in the inferred statement. Therefore, if the keys are in the drawer, it is true that they are either on the table or in the drawer, because being in the drawer satisfies the 'or' condition of the inferred statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
