            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The document must have been notarized or signed' from 'The document must have been signed', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements. The original statement 'The document must have been signed' asserts a necessity - the document's signing is a required condition. The inferred statement 'The document must have been notarized or signed' introduces an alternative condition (notarized) in addition to the original condition (signed) with the use of 'or'. \n\nIn classical logic, when we say 'A or B', it means at least one of the conditions (A or B) must be true for the whole statement to be true. Since 'The document must have been signed' is already asserting that the document being signed is a must, adding 'notarized' as an alternative with 'or' does not contradict the original statement but rather expands the possibilities while still including the original condition as a necessity.\n\nTherefore, if the document must have been signed, it logically follows that it must have been either notarized or signed because the condition of being signed is already a requirement, making the 'or' condition true by default due to the inclusion of 'signed'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
