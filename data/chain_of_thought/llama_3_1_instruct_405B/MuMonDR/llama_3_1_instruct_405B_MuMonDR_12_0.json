            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The project must have been extended or completed by Friday' from 'The project must have been completed by Friday', let's break down the meaning of both statements.\n\nThe original statement 'The project must have been completed by Friday' implies that the completion of the project by Friday was a necessity or a requirement. It does not provide any information about the possibility of the project being extended.\n\nThe inferred statement 'The project must have been extended or completed by Friday' introduces an additional possibility that the project could have been extended, which is not present in the original statement. However, the logic of inference is based on what necessarily follows from the given information. In this case, if the project must have been completed by Friday, then it is true that it must have either been extended (which would still result in its completion) or completed by Friday, as the original statement already necessitates its completion.\n\nTherefore, the inferred statement does logically follow from the original statement because the completion of the project by Friday includes the possibility that it could have been extended before being completed, even though the original statement does not explicitly mention extension.\n\nAnswer: yes",
