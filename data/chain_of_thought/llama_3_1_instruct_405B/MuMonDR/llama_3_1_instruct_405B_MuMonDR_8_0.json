            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The restaurant must have been open for limited hours or closed on Mondays' from 'The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. The original statement explicitly says the restaurant was closed on Mondays, which directly supports part of the inferred statement. The inferred statement adds an alternative possibility that the restaurant might have been open for limited hours on Mondays. Since being closed is a subset of the possibilities included in being either open for limited hours or closed, the original statement logically supports the inferred statement. The inferred statement is broader and includes the condition mentioned in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
