            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The meeting must have been cancelled or scheduled for 2 PM' from 'The meeting must have been scheduled for 2 PM', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements. The original statement asserts a necessity about the meeting's schedule, specifically that it must have been scheduled for 2 PM. The inferred statement introduces an additional possibility, that the meeting must have been cancelled, alongside the original assertion about the schedule.\n\nThe introduction of 'cancelled' as an alternative does not contradict the original statement but rather expands the set of possible outcomes. Since the original statement is about necessity regarding the schedule, adding another possibility (cancellation) does not negate the necessity of the schedule if the meeting wasn't cancelled. Essentially, if the meeting happened, it must have been at 2 PM according to the original statement. The inferred statement simply acknowledges that the meeting could also have been cancelled, which doesn't contradict the original assertion about the timing if the meeting did occur.\n\nTherefore, logically, we can infer 'The meeting must have been cancelled or scheduled for 2 PM' from 'The meeting must have been scheduled for 2 PM' because the addition of 'cancelled' as an option does not negate the necessity of the schedule if the meeting took place.\n\nAnswer: yes",
