            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The concert must have been postponed or sold out' from 'The concert must have been sold out', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. The original statement 'The concert must have been sold out' directly asserts that the concert was sold out, with no mention of postponement. The inferred statement 'The concert must have been postponed or sold out' introduces an additional possibility - that the concert was postponed. \n\nSince 'sold out' is a subset of the possibilities in 'postponed or sold out', we can logically infer the latter from the former because if something must have been sold out, then it fits within the broader condition of being either postponed or sold out. Essentially, if the concert must have been sold out, it satisfies one of the conditions in the 'or' statement, making the inference valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
