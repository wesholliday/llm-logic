            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The room must have been cleaned upon request or daily' from 'The room must have been cleaned daily', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. The original statement 'The room must have been cleaned daily' implies a strict schedule where the room is cleaned every day without exception. The inferred statement 'The room must have been cleaned upon request or daily' adds an alternative condition ('upon request') in addition to the daily cleaning schedule. Since the original statement guarantees daily cleaning regardless of any requests, it inherently fulfills the condition of being cleaned daily as mentioned in the inferred statement. However, the inferred statement introduces a flexibility ('upon request') not present in the original statement. Despite this, the logic of the original statement still holds true under the conditions of the inferred statement because if the room is cleaned daily, it meets the criteria of being cleaned either upon request (if there happened to be a request) or daily.\n\nAnswer: yes",
