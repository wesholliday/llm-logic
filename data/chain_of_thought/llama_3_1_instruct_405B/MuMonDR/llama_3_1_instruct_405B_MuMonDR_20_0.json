            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The event must have been semi-formal or formal' from 'The event must have been formal', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. The original statement specifies that the event 'must have been formal', which indicates a specific level of formality. The inferred statement, 'The event must have been semi-formal or formal', includes the original condition (formal) but also adds another option (semi-formal). Since 'formal' is a subset of 'semi-formal or formal', we can logically conclude that if an event must have been formal, it also fits the criteria of being semi-formal or formal.\n\nAnswer: yes",
