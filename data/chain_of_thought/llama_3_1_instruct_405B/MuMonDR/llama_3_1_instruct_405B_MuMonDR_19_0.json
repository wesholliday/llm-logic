            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The application must have been completed in person or online' from 'The application must have been completed online', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. The original statement specifies that the application must have been completed online, which is a specific requirement. The inferred statement adds an option ('in person') that was not present in the original statement. Since the original statement exclusively mentions 'online' as the method for completing the application, adding 'in person' as an alternative does not contradict the original requirement but rather expands the possibilities. However, the original statement's exclusivity ('must have been completed online') implies that no other method is acceptable. Therefore, we cannot accurately infer the second statement from the first because the first statement does not allow for the application to be completed in person.\n\nAnswer: no",
