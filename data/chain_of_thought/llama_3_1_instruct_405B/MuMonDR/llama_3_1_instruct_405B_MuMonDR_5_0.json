            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The package must have been delivered tomorrow or today' from 'The package must have been delivered today', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. The original statement 'The package must have been delivered today' asserts that the delivery happened on the current day. The inferred statement 'The package must have been delivered tomorrow or today' includes the possibility of delivery on either the current day or the next day.\n\nSince 'today' is a subset of 'tomorrow or today', if the package must have been delivered today, then it is also true that it must have been delivered tomorrow or today, because 'today' is one of the options included in the 'or' condition. This means the inferred statement is logically consistent with the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
