It does not provide any information about wobble zooble. The statement 'The grooble might be in shimble and wobble zooble' implies that the grooble could be in both shimble and wobble zooble simultaneously, which is not something that can be inferred from the original statement. The original statement only mentions shimble as a possible location and does not provide any connection to wobble zooble.\n\nAnswer: no",
