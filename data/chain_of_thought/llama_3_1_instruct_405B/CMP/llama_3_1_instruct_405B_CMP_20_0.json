    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the information given. We have three statements: \n1. Coffee will likely retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, and then soda.\n2. If tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n3. Coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nFrom statement 1, we understand the general likelihood of each beverage retaining the most morning drinkers. Statement 2 provides a conditional scenario that if tea and coffee both don't retain the most morning drinkers, then soda will. Statement 3 reaffirms the likelihood of coffee retaining the most morning drinkers and deduces that tea likely won't because of this.\n\nGiven that it's likely coffee will retain the most morning drinkers, the condition \"if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers\" is less probable but still possible. However, the question is about the logical follow-through from the given statements, not the probability based on market research.\n\nThe key is understanding the conditional logic presented in statement 2. If tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers (which is likely, given coffee's position), then the scenario that coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers would lead to soda retaining the most morning drinkers. This is a logical sequence rather than a probabilistic one based on market research.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure of the statements, it does follow that if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, and given tea likely won't (as per statement 3's deduction), then it logically follows that soda would be in the position to retain the most morning drinkers under the condition presented.\n\nAnswer: yes",
