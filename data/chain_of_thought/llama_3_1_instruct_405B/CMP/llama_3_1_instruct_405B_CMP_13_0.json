    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the information given. Tennessee is expected to add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, and then Missouri with significantly lower growth. The statement also implies a condition: if Georgia doesn't add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn't, Missouri will. However, since Tennessee is likely to add the most jobs, the condition that Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs is less probable. The statement that \"if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will\" is conditional on two premises that are contrary to the main expectation (Tennessee leading in job growth). The expectation that Tennessee will add the most jobs makes the condition for Missouri adding the most jobs (both Georgia and Tennessee not leading) less likely because one of its premises (Tennessee not leading) contradicts the main expectation.\n\nAnswer: no",
