            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two options has to be true for the entire statement to be true. It can be represented as \"A or B,\" where A is \"the book is on the shelf\" and B is \"it must be resting on the table.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\" This statement negates the second option (B) of the first statement. It tells us that it is not necessary for the book to be resting on the table, which can be represented as \"not B.\"\n\nGiven these two statements, we can apply a logical rule known as \"disjunctive syllogism.\" This rule states that if we have \"A or B\" and \"not B,\" we can conclude \"A.\" \n\nApplying this rule to our statements:\n\n- We have \"A or B\" from the first statement (the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table).\n- We have \"not B\" from the second statement (it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table).\n\nTherefore, we can logically conclude \"A,\" which means \"the book is on the shelf.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
