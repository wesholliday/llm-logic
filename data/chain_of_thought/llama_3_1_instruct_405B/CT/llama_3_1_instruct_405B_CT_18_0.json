            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, we need to apply the rules of logical inference, specifically looking at the contrapositive of a statement. The original statement is \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This can be represented in a conditional form as \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nApplying this to our original statement, we substitute P and Q to get the contrapositive: \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\" This statement is the contrapositive of the original and is therefore logically equivalent to it.\n\nAnswer: yes",
