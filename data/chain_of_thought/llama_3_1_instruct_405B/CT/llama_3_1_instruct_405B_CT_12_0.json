            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, let's analyze the logical structure of the statements. The first statement is of the form \"If A, then B\" (If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo). This kind of statement does not assert that A actually happened or that B actually happened; it only asserts a relationship between A and B, specifically that if A did happen, then B must have happened as well.\n\nThe second statement is of the form \"If not B, then not A\" (If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park). This is the contrapositive of the first statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\". Since the second statement is the contrapositive of the first, it logically follows from the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\" from \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
