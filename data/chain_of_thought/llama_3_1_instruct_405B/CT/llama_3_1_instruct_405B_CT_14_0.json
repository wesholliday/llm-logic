            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, we need to understand the basic principles of logical inference, particularly focusing on the rule of contrapositive inference. The original statement is \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\" This can be represented logically as \"If P, then Q\" or \"P \u2192 Q,\" where P is \"the bear was in the cave\" and Q is \"the wolf was in the den.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P,\" which is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, applying this rule to our original statement, we get \"If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nThis shows that the inference from the original statement to the conclusion is logically valid, as it directly follows from the rule of contrapositive inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
