            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, we need to understand the basic principles of conditional statements and their inverses, converses, and contrapositives. The original statement is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This can be represented as \"If P, then Q\" where P = Tom watched football and Q = Jen watched basketball.\n\nThe question asks us to infer \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\" This statement is the contrapositive of the original statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P.\" In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\" from the original statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
