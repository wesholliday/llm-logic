            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, let's analyze the logical structure of both statements. The first statement is of the form \"If A, then B\" (If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis). This kind of statement does not assert that A is true or that B is true; it only asserts that if A happens to be true, then B must also be true.\n\nThe second statement is of the form \"If not B, then not A\" (If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball). This is the contrapositive form of the first statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if \"If A, then B\" is true, then \"If not B, then not A\" is also true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\" from \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" because the second statement is the contrapositive of the first, and thus logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: yes",
