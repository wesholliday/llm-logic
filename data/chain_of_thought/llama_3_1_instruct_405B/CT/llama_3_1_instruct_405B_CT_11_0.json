            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, we can apply the rules of logical inference, specifically looking at the structure of the given statement and the statement we're trying to infer. The original statement is of the form \"If P, then Q\" (If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry). The statement we're trying to infer is of the form \"If not Q, then not P\" (If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate). In logic, this is known as the contrapositive form of the original statement. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa. Therefore, we can indeed infer \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\" from \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
