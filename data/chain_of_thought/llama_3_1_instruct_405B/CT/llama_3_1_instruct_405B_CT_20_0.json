            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, we need to apply the rules of logical inference, specifically focusing on the given conditional statement and its contrapositive. The original statement is \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be represented in a conditional form as \"If A, then B\" where A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement, meaning they have the same truth value. Therefore, if we have \"If A, then B,\" we can infer \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nApplying this to the given statement, the contrapositive of \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is indeed \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\" Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
