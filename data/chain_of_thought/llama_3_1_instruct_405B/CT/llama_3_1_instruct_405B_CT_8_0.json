            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the original statement into a logical form. The original statement is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"V \u2192 M,\" where \"V\" stands for \"the vampire was awake\" and \"M\" stands for \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake\" from the original statement. In logical terms, this new statement is represented as \"\u00acM \u2192 \u00acV,\" where \"\u00ac\" denotes negation (meaning \"not\").\n\nThe process of inferring \"\u00acM \u2192 \u00acV\" from \"V \u2192 M\" is an application of the logical rule known as contrapositive inference. The contrapositive of a statement \"A \u2192 B\" is \"\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA,\" and in classical logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning they have the same truth value in all possible worlds.\n\nTherefore, from \"V \u2192 M,\" we can logically infer \"\u00acM \u2192 \u00acV,\" which translates back to \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
