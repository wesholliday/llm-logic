            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, let's analyze the given statement logically. The original statement is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This is a conditional statement in the form of \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the shirt was cotton\" and B is \"the pants were denim.\" \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" Therefore, applying this rule to our original statement, we substitute A and B with their respective negations and swap their positions, resulting in \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\" \n\nThis process shows that the inferred statement is the contrapositive of the original statement, and since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
