            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, let's analyze the logical structure of the statements. The first statement is of the form \"If A, then B\" (If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel). The second statement is of the form \"If not B, then not A\" (If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James). In logic, the second form is known as the contrapositive of the first form, and it is logically equivalent to the first statement. This means that if the first statement is true, the second statement must also be true. Therefore, we can indeed infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
