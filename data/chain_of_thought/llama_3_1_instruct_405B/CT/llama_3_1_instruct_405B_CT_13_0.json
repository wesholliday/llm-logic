            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red' from 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue', we need to examine the logical structure of these statements. The original statement is in the form of 'If A, then B', which implies that if condition A is true, then condition B must also be true. However, it does not explicitly state what happens if condition B is not true; it only guarantees that if A is true, B cannot be false.\n\nThe inference we are asked to evaluate is essentially the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red' is the contrapositive of 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue', and we can indeed infer it from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
