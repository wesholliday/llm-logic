            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, let's analyze the logical structure of both statements. The original statement is \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This can be represented in a conditional form as \"Sue chose pizza \u2192 Bob chose pasta.\" \n\nThe statement we are asked to infer is \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\" This is the contrapositive of the original statement, which can be logically represented as \"Not (Bob chose pasta) \u2192 Not (Sue chose pizza).\" \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion of the original statement and then switching them. Therefore, if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true.\n\nGiven this logical principle, we can indeed infer \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\" from \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
