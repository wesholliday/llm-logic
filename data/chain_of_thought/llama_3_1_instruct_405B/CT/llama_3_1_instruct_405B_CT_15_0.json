            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, we need to understand the basic principles of logical inference, particularly focusing on the contrapositive form of a conditional statement. The original statement is \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This can be represented in a conditional form as \"If P, then Q\" where P = \"Sam took a plane\" and Q = \"Erin took a train.\"\n\nThe contrapositive form of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nApplying this to our original statement, we substitute P and Q with our actual conditions, resulting in the contrapositive form: \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\" This statement is the contrapositive of the original, and thus, it is logically equivalent and can be inferred from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
