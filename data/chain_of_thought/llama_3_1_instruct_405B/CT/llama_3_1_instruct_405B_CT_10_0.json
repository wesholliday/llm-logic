            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the original statement into a logical form. The original statement is \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This can be represented as \"A \u2192 B\" where A is \"the dog was inside\" and B is \"the cat was outside.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside\" from the original statement. This new statement can be represented as \"\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA\" where \u00acB means \"the cat was not outside\" and \u00acA means \"the dog was not inside.\"\n\nIn logic, the form \"A \u2192 B\" is equivalent to \"\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA\" through the rule of contrapositive inference. This means that if we know \"A implies B,\" we can logically infer that \"not B implies not A.\"\n\nTherefore, from the original statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside,\" we can logically infer \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
