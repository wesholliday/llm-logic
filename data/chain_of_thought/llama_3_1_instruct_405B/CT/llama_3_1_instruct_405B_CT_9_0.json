            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, let's analyze the logical structure of the statements. The first statement is of the form \"If A, then B\" (If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt). The second statement is of the form \"If not B, then not A\" (If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt). In logic, the second form is known as the contrapositive of the first form. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa. Therefore, we can logically infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
