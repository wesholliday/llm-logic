            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the original statement into a logical form. The original statement is \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This can be represented as \"G \u2192 U\", where G represents \"the griffin was in the forest\" and U represents \"the unicorn was in the forest\".\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\" from the original statement. This new statement can be represented as \"\u00acU \u2192 \u00acG\", where \u00ac represents \"not\".\n\nIn logic, the original statement \"G \u2192 U\" is equivalent to \"\u00acU \u2192 \u00acG\" by the rule of contrapositive inference. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, from \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\", we can indeed infer \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
