            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, let's analyze the given statement and its implications. The original statement is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This statement implies a relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence at the wedding but does not explicitly state anything about their absence. However, in logic, the given statement can be represented as \"Mary at the wedding \u2192 Sue at the wedding.\" \n\nFrom this, we can apply the rule of contrapositive inference, which states that from a conditional statement \"p \u2192 q,\" we can infer \"not q \u2192 not p.\" Applying this rule to our original statement, we get \"If not Sue at the wedding, then not Mary at the wedding,\" which is logically equivalent to \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\" \n\nTherefore, through logical deduction, specifically using the contrapositive, we can indeed infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
