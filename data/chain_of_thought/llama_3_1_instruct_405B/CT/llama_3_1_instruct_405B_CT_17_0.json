            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, we need to understand the basic principles of logical inference, particularly focusing on the rule of contrapositive inference. The original statement is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\" This can be represented in a conditional form as \"If P, then Q\" where P = \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q = \"Kate ate the salad.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nApplying this rule to our original statement, we get the contrapositive as \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\" This statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, from \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad,\" we can indeed infer \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
