            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, let's analyze the logical structure of both statements. The first statement is \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This can be represented in a conditional form as \"A \u2192 C,\" where A represents \"Alex finished the race\" and C represents \"Chris finished the race.\" \n\nThe second statement we are asked to infer is \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\" This can be represented logically as \"\u00acC \u2192 \u00acA,\" where \u00ac represents negation (meaning \"not\").\n\nIn logic, the rule of contrapositive states that a conditional statement \"A \u2192 C\" is logically equivalent to its contrapositive \"\u00acC \u2192 \u00acA.\" This means that if the first statement is true, the second statement must also be true, as they are logically equivalent.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race,\" we can indeed infer \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
