            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true. It can be represented logically as \"M or Q,\" where M stands for \"the splat is morphed\" and Q stands for \"it must be quanked.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked.\" This is the negation of the second condition in the first statement. It can be represented logically as \"not Q.\"\n\nGiven these two statements, we can apply a logical rule known as disjunctive syllogism. Disjunctive syllogism states that if we have \"P or Q\" and \"not Q,\" we can infer \"P.\" Applying this rule to our statements:\n\n- We have \"M or Q\" from the first statement.\n- We have \"not Q\" from the second statement.\n\nBy disjunctive syllogism, we can infer \"M,\" which means \"The splat is morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
