            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions needs to be true. In logical terms, this can be represented as \"A or B,\" where A is \"the grommet is sploffed\" and B is \"it must be plopped.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped.\" This directly negates the second condition (B) of the first statement. In logical terms, this can be represented as \"not B.\"\n\nGiven these two statements, we can apply a logical rule known as disjunctive syllogism. Disjunctive syllogism states that if we have \"A or B\" and \"not B,\" we can conclude \"A.\" This is because the disjunction (\"or\") requires at least one of the conditions to be true, and by negating one of the conditions, we are left with the other condition being true.\n\nTherefore, by applying disjunctive syllogism to our statements, we can infer that \"The grommet is sploffed\" because the alternative (\"it must be plopped\") has been negated.\n\nAnswer: yes",
