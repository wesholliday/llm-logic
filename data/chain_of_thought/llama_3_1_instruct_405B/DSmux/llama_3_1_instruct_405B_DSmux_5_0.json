The first statement is \"Either the zinger is fraggled or it must be smoogled.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions needs to be true for the whole statement to be true. It can be represented as \"A or B,\" where A is \"the zinger is fraggled\" and B is \"it must be smoogled.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled.\" This statement negates the second part of the first statement. It can be represented as \"not B.\"\n\nGiven these two statements, we can apply a logical rule known as disjunctive syllogism. Disjunctive syllogism states that if we have \"A or B\" and \"not B,\" we can conclude \"A.\" This is because the disjunction (\"or\") requires at least one of the conditions to be true, and by negating one of the conditions, we are left with the other condition being true.\n\nTherefore, applying disjunctive syllogism to our statements, we can infer that \"The zinger is fraggled\" because the alternative (\"it must be smoogled\") is negated.\n\nAnswer: yes",
