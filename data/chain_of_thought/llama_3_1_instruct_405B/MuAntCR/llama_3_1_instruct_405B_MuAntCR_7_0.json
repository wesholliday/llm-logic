The original statement only mentions that the exam covered all chapters, but it does not provide any information about the difficulty level of the exam. The inferred statement adds an assumption about the difficulty of the exam, which is not supported by the original statement. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the difficulty of the exam based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
