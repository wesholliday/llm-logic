The original statement only mentions the color of the book's cover, which is red. It does not provide any information about the book's location. The inferred statement adds a new piece of information, which is that the book must have been on the shelf. Since the original statement does not mention anything about the book's location, we cannot logically infer that the book was on the shelf based solely on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
