However, this statement does not provide any specific information about the timing of the delivery. It does not mention a particular day or time frame when the package was delivered and signed for. Therefore, we cannot infer that the package must have been delivered yesterday specifically, as the original statement does not contain any temporal details that would allow us to pinpoint the delivery to yesterday.\n\nAnswer: no",
