            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The document must have been signed and notarized' from 'The document must have been notarized', we need to consider the process of notarization. Notarization typically involves a notary public verifying the identity of the person signing a document and witnessing the signature. For a document to be notarized, it implies that the document has indeed been signed in the presence of a notary public, as the notary's role is to authenticate the signature.\n\nGiven this understanding, when it is stated that 'The document must have been notarized', it inherently implies that the document was signed as part of the notarization process. Therefore, it is logical to infer that if a document has been notarized, it has also been signed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
