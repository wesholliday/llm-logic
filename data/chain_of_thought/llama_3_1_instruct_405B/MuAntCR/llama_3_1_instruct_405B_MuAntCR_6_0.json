            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM' from 'The concert must have started at 8 PM', we need to analyze the information provided and the information inferred. The original statement only mentions the start time of the concert, which is 8 PM. There is no information provided about the concert being sold out. Inferring that the concert was sold out would be adding information not present in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot accurately infer that the concert must have been sold out based solely on the information about the start time.\n\nAnswer: no",
