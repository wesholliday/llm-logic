However, it does not specify the language of the movie itself. Subtitles can be used for various reasons, such as translating a foreign language film into the viewer's native language or providing additional information for a film in the same language. Therefore, we cannot infer that the movie was specifically in English just because it had subtitles. The presence of subtitles does not inherently indicate the language of the movie.\n\nAnswer: no",
