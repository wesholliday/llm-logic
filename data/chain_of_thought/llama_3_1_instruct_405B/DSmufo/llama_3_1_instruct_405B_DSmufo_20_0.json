The first statement, \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head,\" implies that there is no necessity for the sunglasses to be on her head. The second statement, \"Either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag,\" presents two possibilities: the sunglasses are either on her head or in her bag. Since the first statement negates the necessity of the sunglasses being on her head, we are left with the second possibility from the second statement, which is that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
