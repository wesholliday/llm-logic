            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements and the question into logical components. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be represented as \"M \u2192 S,\" where M represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\" The second statement is a simple affirmation: \"Sue was at the wedding,\" which we can represent as \"S.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"Mary was at the wedding\" (M) from these two statements.\n\nIn logical terms, having \"M \u2192 S\" and \"S\" does not necessarily imply \"M.\" The reason is that the conditional statement \"M \u2192 S\" only guarantees that if M is true, then S must be true. However, it does not guarantee that if S is true, M must be true. There could be other reasons why S is true that have nothing to do with M.\n\nFor example, Sue could have been at the wedding because she was invited by someone else, not necessarily because Mary was there. Therefore, from the information given, we cannot logically infer that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
