            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal\" implies that there is no necessity for the truck to be made of metal. This does not confirm or deny the material of the truck; it simply states that the truck's material is not necessarily metal.\n\n2. \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\" sets up a conditional relationship where if the doll is plastic, then it is necessary for the truck to be metal.\n\nNow, combining these two statements, if the doll was indeed plastic, then according to the second statement, the truck must have been metal. However, the first statement says it's not the case that the truck must have been metal, which contradicts the outcome of the second statement if the doll was plastic.\n\nTherefore, since the first statement negates the necessity of the truck being metal, and the second statement requires the truck to be metal if the doll is plastic, we can infer that the doll was not plastic. This is because if the doll were plastic, it would necessitate the truck being metal, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
