            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest\" can be translated into a more formal logical expression as \u00ac(the unicorn must have been in the forest). This statement implies that there is no necessity for the unicorn to have been in the forest, but it does not rule out the possibility of the unicorn being in the forest entirely.\n\n2. \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest\" can be translated into a conditional statement: if (the griffin was in the forest) \u2192 then (the unicorn must have been in the forest). This statement establishes a relationship where the presence of the griffin in the forest necessitates the presence of the unicorn.\n\nGiven these two statements, we want to determine if we can infer \"The griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the unicorn's presence in the forest is not a necessity. The second statement tells us that if the griffin was in the forest, the unicorn's presence becomes a necessity. Since we know from the first statement that the unicorn's presence is not a necessity, it implies that the condition which would make the unicorn's presence necessary (the griffin being in the forest) cannot be true. Therefore, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest because if it were, it would contradict the information given about the unicorn's presence not being necessary.\n\nAnswer: yes",
