            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake\" implies that there is no necessity for the mummy to have been awake. This doesn't directly tell us whether the mummy was awake or not, but it leaves open the possibility that the mummy could have been asleep.\n\n2. \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake\" sets a condition where if the vampire was awake, it necessitates the mummy being awake as well. This statement directly connects the state of the vampire to the state of the mummy, but only in one direction (vampire awake \u2192 mummy awake).\n\nNow, combining these two statements, if we assume the vampire was awake, then according to the second statement, the mummy must have been awake. However, the first statement tells us it's not necessary for the mummy to have been awake, which contradicts the outcome of assuming the vampire was awake.\n\nTherefore, given that having the vampire awake leads to a contradiction with the given statements (since it would necessitate the mummy being awake, which contradicts the first statement's implication that the mummy's wakefulness is not a necessity), we can infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
