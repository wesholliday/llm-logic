            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding\" implies that there is no necessity or obligation for Sue to have been at the wedding. It does not confirm whether Sue was actually at the wedding or not; it merely states that her presence was not a must.\n\n2. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" sets up a conditional relationship where Mary's presence at the wedding necessitates Sue's presence. This means if Mary was there, Sue had to be there as well.\n\nNow, combining these two statements, if we assume Mary was at the wedding, then according to the second statement, Sue must have been at the wedding. However, the first statement tells us it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding, which seems to create a contradiction if we were to assert Mary's presence.\n\nTo resolve this, we can infer that since Sue's presence was not a necessity (from the first statement), and given that Sue's presence is conditional on Mary's presence (from the second statement), the only way both statements can hold true without contradiction is if Mary was not at the wedding. This is because if Mary was not at the wedding, the conditional requirement for Sue to be there (as stated in the second statement) is not triggered, thus aligning with the first statement that Sue's presence was not a necessity.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can logically infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
