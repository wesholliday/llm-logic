            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" can be translated into a logical statement as \u00ac(Mark must have bought the blue shirt), where \"\u00ac\" denotes negation. This means it's not necessary or certain that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\n2. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" can be translated into a logical statement as (Lisa bought the red shirt) \u2192 (Mark must have bought the blue shirt), where \"\u2192\" denotes implication. This sets up a condition where if the first event (Lisa buying the red shirt) occurs, the second event (Mark buying the blue shirt) must occur.\n\nNow, combining these two statements, we have a situation where we know Mark didn't necessarily buy the blue shirt (from the first statement), and according to the second statement, if Lisa bought the red shirt, Mark would have had to buy the blue shirt.\n\nGiven that we cannot conclude Mark bought the blue shirt (from the first statement), and knowing the conditional relationship between Lisa's and Mark's purchases (from the second statement), we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This is because if Lisa had bought the red shirt, it would necessitate Mark buying the blue shirt, which contradicts the first statement that it's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, logically, we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt because if she had, it would lead to a contradiction with the given information about Mark's purchase.\n\nAnswer: yes",
