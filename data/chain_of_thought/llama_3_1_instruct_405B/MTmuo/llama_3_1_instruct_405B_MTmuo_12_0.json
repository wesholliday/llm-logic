            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" can be translated into a logical statement as \u00ac(Lucy must have gone to the zoo), where \"\u00ac\" denotes negation. This implies that it is not necessary or not obligatory for Lucy to have gone to the zoo.\n\n2. \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" can be translated into a conditional statement as (Joe went to the park) \u2192 (Lucy must have gone to the zoo). This sets up a condition where if the antecedent (Joe went to the park) is true, then the consequent (Lucy must have gone to the zoo) must also be true.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can apply a logical rule known as modus tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (A \u2192 B) and we know that the consequent (B) is false, then we can infer that the antecedent (A) is also false.\n\nIn this case, since we know from the first statement that it's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo (the consequent of our conditional statement is negated), we can infer that Joe did not go to the park, because if he had, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo, which contradicts our first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
