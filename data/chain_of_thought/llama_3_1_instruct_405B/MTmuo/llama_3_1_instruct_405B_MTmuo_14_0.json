            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den\" can be translated into a logical statement as \u00ac(wolf in den), where \u00ac denotes negation.\n\n2. \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den\" can be translated into a logical statement as (bear in cave) \u2192 (wolf in den), where \u2192 denotes implication.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the wolf was not necessarily in the den. The second statement provides a condition under which the wolf must have been in the den, namely if the bear was in the cave.\n\nNow, if we assume that the bear was in the cave, then according to the second statement, the wolf must have been in the den. However, this contradicts the first statement, which says it's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den.\n\nTo resolve this contradiction, we can conclude that our assumption - the bear was in the cave - must be false. Therefore, we can infer that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes",
