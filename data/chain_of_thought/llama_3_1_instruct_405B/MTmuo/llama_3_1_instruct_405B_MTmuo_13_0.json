            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue\" can be translated into a logical statement as \u00ac(Truck must be blue), where \"\u00ac\" denotes negation. This statement implies that there is no necessity for the truck to be blue; it could be any color.\n\n2. \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\" can be translated into a logical statement as (Car is red) \u2192 (Truck must be blue), where \"\u2192\" denotes implication. This statement sets up a condition where if the car is red, then it is necessary for the truck to be blue.\n\nNow, combining these two statements, we can infer as follows:\n\n- If the car was indeed red, then according to the second statement, the truck must have been blue. However, the first statement contradicts this necessity by stating it's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\n\n- Given that the first statement negates the necessity of the truck being blue, and the second statement requires the truck to be blue if the car is red, the only way both statements can coexist without contradiction is if the premise \"the car was red\" is false.\n\nTherefore, logically, we can infer that the car was not red because if it were, it would necessitate the truck being blue, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
