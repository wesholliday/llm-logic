This implies that there is no necessity for the book to be a mystery novel; it could be any genre.\n\n2. \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel\" translates to \"Book written by James \u2192 Book must be a mystery novel\". This statement establishes a condition where if James is the author, the book's genre is necessarily a mystery novel.\n\nNow, combining these two statements, we can infer as follows:\n\n- If the book being written by James necessitates it being a mystery novel, but it's stated that it's not necessarily a mystery novel, then the condition \"Book written by James\" cannot be true because it leads to a contradiction with the first statement.\n\n- Therefore, since the condition that leads to the book necessarily being a mystery novel (James being the author) cannot hold true given the first statement, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
