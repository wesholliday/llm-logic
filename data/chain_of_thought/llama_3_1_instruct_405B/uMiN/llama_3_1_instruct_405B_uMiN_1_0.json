            "content": "Explanation: To answer this question, we need to understand the nuances of the language used, particularly the difference between \"might not have been\" and \"must have been.\" \"Might not have been\" suggests a possibility that something did not happen, which implies uncertainty or doubt about the occurrence. On the other hand, \"must have been\" indicates a necessity or certainty that something happened. If we say Mary might not have been at the wedding, we are acknowledging there is a possibility she was not there, which directly contradicts the idea that she must have been at the wedding. The presence of doubt (indicated by \"might not have been\") negates the certainty (indicated by \"must have been\"). Therefore, if there's a possibility Mary was not at the wedding, we cannot assert that she must have been there.\n\nAnswer: yes",
