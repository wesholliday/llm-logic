            "content": "Explanation: To approach this question, let's break down the statements. The first statement says, \"The toy might not be in the toy box.\" This implies that there is a possibility that the toy is not in the toy box, but it does not rule out the possibility that the toy could be in the toy box. The second statement we are asked to consider is, \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box.\" This statement directly negates the necessity of the toy being in the toy box, meaning the toy does not have to be in the toy box. \n\nGiven the first statement, we understand that there is uncertainty about the toy's location. The toy could be in the toy box, or it could be elsewhere. The key word \"might\" indicates a lack of certainty. The second statement essentially says the same thing but from a different angle. It negates the idea that the toy's presence in the toy box is a necessity.\n\nTherefore, from the first statement, we can indeed infer the second statement because if the toy might not be in the toy box, it directly implies that it is not a must for the toy to be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
