            "content": "Explanation: To answer this question, we need to understand the difference between \"might not have\" and \"must have.\" \"Might not have\" implies a possibility that something did not happen, but it does not rule out the possibility that it did happen. On the other hand, \"must have\" implies a necessity or certainty that something happened. If we say Sue might not have chosen pizza, we are acknowledging there is a possibility she did not choose pizza, but we are also leaving open the possibility that she did choose pizza. Therefore, saying Sue might not have chosen pizza directly contradicts the idea that Sue must have chosen pizza, because the former introduces doubt or uncertainty, while the latter asserts certainty.\n\nAnswer: yes",
