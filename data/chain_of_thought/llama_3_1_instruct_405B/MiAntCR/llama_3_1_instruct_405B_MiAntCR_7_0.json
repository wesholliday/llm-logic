The original statement only mentions the scope of the exam (all chapters), without providing any information about the difficulty level of the exam. The inferred statement adds an assumption about the difficulty of the exam, which is not supported by the original statement. The original statement only provides information about the potential breadth of the exam material, not its depth or difficulty. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the difficulty of the exam based solely on the information that it might cover all chapters.\n\nAnswer: no",
