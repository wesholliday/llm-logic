However, this statement alone does not provide any specific information about the timing of the delivery. It only mentions the possibility of the package being signed for, without specifying when this might happen. The statement \"The package might be delivered today and signed for\" adds an additional piece of information about the delivery potentially happening on the same day, which is not directly inferable from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
