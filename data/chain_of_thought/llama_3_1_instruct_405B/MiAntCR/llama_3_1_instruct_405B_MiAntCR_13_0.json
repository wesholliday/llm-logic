However, it does not specify the language of the movie itself. Subtitles are often used when the audio is in a different language from what the intended audience predominantly speaks, but they can also be used for other purposes such as to provide additional information or to aid viewers who are hard of hearing. The original statement does not provide enough information to conclude that the movie is specifically in English and has subtitles. It merely indicates the possibility of subtitles being present, without specifying the language of the movie's audio.\n\nAnswer: no",
