            "content": "Explanation: This question involves a type of logical argument known as a conditional statement. The given statement is \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins were blueberry.\" The question asks us to infer whether \"If not P, then not Q\" logically follows from \"If P, then Q.\" This is a classic case of attempting to apply the inverse of a conditional statement, which is a logical fallacy. The inverse of a conditional statement does not logically follow from the original statement. The only thing that logically follows from \"If P, then Q\" is the contrapositive, which is \"If not Q, then not P.\" Therefore, we cannot logically infer that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
