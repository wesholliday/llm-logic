            "content": "Explanation: To address this question, we need to examine the structure of the given statement and see if it allows us to make the proposed inference. The original statement is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the shirt was cotton\" and B is \"the pants were denim.\" \n\nIn logic, the statement \"If A, then B\" does not necessarily imply its converse, \"If not A, then not B.\" The original statement only guarantees that if the shirt was indeed cotton, the pants would be denim. It does not provide information about the material of the pants if the shirt was not cotton. There could be cases where the shirt is not cotton, and the pants are still denim, or cases where the shirt is not cotton, and the pants are also not denim. The original statement does not rule out either of these possibilities.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
