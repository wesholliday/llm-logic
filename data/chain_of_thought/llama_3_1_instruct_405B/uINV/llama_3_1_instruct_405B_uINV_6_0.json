The original statement is \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This can be represented in logical terms as \"Sue chose pizza \u2192 Bob chose pasta.\" \n\nThe inference we are asked to consider is \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\" Logically, this is represented as \"Not (Sue chose pizza) \u2192 Not (Bob chose pasta).\" \n\nThe original statement does not logically imply the inference. The original statement only specifies what happens if Sue chose pizza; it does not provide information about what happens if Sue did not choose pizza. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta, based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
