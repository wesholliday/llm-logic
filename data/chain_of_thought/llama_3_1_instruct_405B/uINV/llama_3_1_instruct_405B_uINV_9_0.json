            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statement into a logical form. The original statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as \"If A, then B\" or A \u2192 B, where A is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and B is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThe question asks us to infer whether \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" is true based on the original statement. This new statement can be represented as \"If not A, then not B\" or \u00acA \u2192 \u00acB.\n\nIn logic, the original statement \"If A, then B\" does not necessarily imply \"If not A, then not B.\" The latter is a fallacy known as \"denying the antecedent.\" Just because A leads to B, it doesn't mean that not A must lead to not B. There could be other conditions under which B occurs even if A does not.\n\nFor example, Mark might have bought the blue shirt regardless of Lisa's choice, or there might be another condition that leads Mark to buy the blue shirt that is independent of Lisa's actions.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
