            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statement into a logical form. The statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" can be represented as \"P \u2192 T\", where P represents \"Sam took a plane\" and T represents \"Erin took a train\". The question asks if we can infer \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train\", which is represented as \"\u00acP \u2192 \u00acT\". This is essentially asking if the contrapositive of the original statement is true. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if \"P \u2192 T\" is true, then \"\u00acT \u2192 \u00acP\" is also true, which means if Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane. However, the question asks for \"\u00acP \u2192 \u00acT\", which is not directly the contrapositive but rather the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of a statement does not logically follow from the original statement. Hence, we cannot infer \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
