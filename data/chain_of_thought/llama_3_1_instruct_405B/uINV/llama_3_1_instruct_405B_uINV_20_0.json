            "content": "Explanation: This question involves a classic example of a conditional statement in logic: \"If A, then B.\" The given statement is \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" To determine if we can infer that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow, we need to understand the relationship between conditional statements and their inverses, converses, and contrapositives.\n\nThe original statement is of the form \"If A, then B\" (If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow). The inverse of this statement would be \"If not A, then not B\" (If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow), which is what we're asked to infer. However, the inverse of a conditional statement does not logically follow from the original statement. The only logically equivalent statement to \"If A, then B\" is its contrapositive, \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow, based solely on the original statement. The original statement only guarantees that if the apple was red, the banana was yellow; it does not provide information about the color of the banana if the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: no",
