            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statement into a logical form. The original statement is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This can be represented as \"Tom watched football \u2192 Jen watched basketball.\" In logic, this kind of statement does not imply its converse or inverse directly. The inverse of this statement would be \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball,\" which is what we're asked to infer.\n\nHowever, from the original statement, we cannot logically infer its inverse without additional information. The original statement only guarantees that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. It does not provide information about what happens if Tom did not watch football. Jen could still have watched basketball even if Tom did not watch football, or she might not have. The original statement simply does not cover this scenario.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
