            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statement into a logical form. The statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" can be represented as \"Jeff played basketball \u2192 Amy played tennis.\" In logical terms, this is \"p \u2192 q,\" where \"p\" is \"Jeff played basketball\" and \"q\" is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis\" from the given statement. This inference is \"\u00acp \u2192 \u00acq\" in logical terms, where \"\u00ac\" denotes negation.\n\nThe original statement implies that if Jeff played basketball, we can be certain Amy played tennis. However, it does not provide information about what happens if Jeff did not play basketball. Amy could still have played tennis even if Jeff did not play basketball. The conclusion \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis\" assumes a relationship that is not logically supported by the original statement.\n\nIn logic, the original statement \"p \u2192 q\" does not imply \"\u00acp \u2192 \u00acq.\" The latter is a fallacy known as \"denying the antecedent.\" To infer \"\u00acp \u2192 \u00acq,\" we would need additional information or a different initial statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
