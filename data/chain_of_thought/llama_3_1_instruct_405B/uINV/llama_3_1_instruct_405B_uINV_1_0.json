            "content": "Explanation: This question involves a classic example of a logical fallacy known as \"denying the antecedent.\" The original statement is in the form of \"if A, then B\" (if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding). From this statement, we cannot logically infer the converse, which would be \"if not A, then not B\" (if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding), without additional information. The original statement only guarantees that if Mary was at the wedding, Sue would also be there, but it does not provide any information about the scenario where Mary is not at the wedding. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Mary was not at the wedding, Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
