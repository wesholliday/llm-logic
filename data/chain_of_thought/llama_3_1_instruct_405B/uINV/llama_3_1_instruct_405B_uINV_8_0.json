            "content": "Explanation: This question involves a classic example of a conditional statement in logic: \"If A, then B.\" The given statement is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" To determine if we can infer that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake, we need to understand the relationship between conditional statements and their inverses, converses, and contrapositives.\n\nThe original statement is of the form \"If A, then B\" (If vampire awake, then mummy awake). The inverse of this statement would be \"If not A, then not B\" (If vampire not awake, then mummy not awake), which is what we're asked to infer. However, the inverse of a conditional statement does not logically follow from the original statement. What logically follows is the contrapositive, which would be \"If not B, then not A\" (If mummy not awake, then vampire not awake).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement alone, we cannot logically infer that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake, because the original statement only guarantees the mummy's wakefulness if the vampire is awake; it does not provide information about the mummy's state if the vampire is not awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
