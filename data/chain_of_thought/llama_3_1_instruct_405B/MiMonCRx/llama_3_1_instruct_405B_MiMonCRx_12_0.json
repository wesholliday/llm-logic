The original statement is \"The zibble might be frobbed and quorked.\" This statement implies that there is a possibility that the zibble is both frobbed and quorked. \n\nNow, let's examine the statement we are trying to infer: \"The zibble might be quorked.\" This statement only mentions the possibility of the zibble being quorked, without any reference to it being frobbed.\n\nSince the original statement mentions the possibility of the zibble being both frobbed and quorked, it inherently includes the possibility of it being quorked. Therefore, we can logically infer that if the zibble might be frobbed and quorked, then it also might be quorked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
