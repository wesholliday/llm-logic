            "content": "Explanation: To answer this question, we need to understand the relationship between \"must have been\" and \"might not have been.\" If it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding, this means that there isn't conclusive evidence or a requirement that necessitates her presence at the wedding. The phrase \"must have been\" implies necessity or certainty. When we negate this necessity by saying \"it's not the case that Mary must have been,\" we open up the possibility that Mary could have been absent. The statement \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" suggests a possibility of her absence, which directly aligns with negating the necessity of her presence. Therefore, if it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding, we can indeed infer that there is a possibility she was not there, which is what \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" suggests.\n\nAnswer: yes",
