            "content": "Explanation: This problem involves a simple deductive argument. We are given two premises: (1) Either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand, and (2) the notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand. To solve this, we can apply the rule of disjunctive syllogism, which states that if we have a disjunction (an \"or\" statement) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false, we can conclude that the other disjunct is true. In this case, the disjunction is \"the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand.\" Since we know that the notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand (the second disjunct is false), we can conclude that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
