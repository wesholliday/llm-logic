The disjunctive syllogism takes the form: \"Either A or B; Not A; Therefore, B.\" In this scenario, we are given two premises: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table\" and \"the book isn't resting on the table.\" By applying the disjunctive syllogism, we can conclude that since one of the options (the book resting on the table) is negated, the other option (the book is on the shelf) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
