This is an \"or\" statement, meaning at least one of the conditions must be true. The second statement tells us that the phone isn't ringing in the kitchen, which directly negates the second possibility presented in the first statement. Since one of the two possibilities has been eliminated, we are left with the only remaining option.\n\nAnswer: yes",
