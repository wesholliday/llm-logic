The second statement eliminates one of those possibilities, namely that the piece is blending in on the floor. By the process of elimination, if one of the two possibilities is ruled out, the other must be true. Therefore, since we know the piece isn't blending in on the floor, the only remaining option is that it is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
