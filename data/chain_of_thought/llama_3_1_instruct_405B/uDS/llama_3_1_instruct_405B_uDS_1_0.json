            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden\" and \"Fido is not in the garden\". The first statement presents two possibilities for Fido's location, and the second statement eliminates one of those possibilities. By the process of elimination, if Fido is not in the garden, then the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that Fido is inside. This is a classic example of a disjunctive syllogism, a valid form of argument in logic. The disjunctive syllogism takes the form: \"Either A or B; Not A; Therefore, B\". Applying this to our scenario, we can logically conclude that since Fido is not in the garden, he must be inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
