            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The document must have been signed and notarized' from 'The document must have been signed and it must have been notarized', we need to examine the logical structure of the two statements. The original statement is a conjunction of two separate requirements: the document must have been signed, and it must have been notarized. These are presented as distinct necessities, linked by 'and', which indicates that both conditions must be met. The inferred statement combines these requirements into a single, still conjunctive, condition. Since 'and' is commutative and associative in English, the meaning of the two statements is logically equivalent. The inferred statement merely omits the repetition of 'it must have been', making it more concise without altering the substance. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
