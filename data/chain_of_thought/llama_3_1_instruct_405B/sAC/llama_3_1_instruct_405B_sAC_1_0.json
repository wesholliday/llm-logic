            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement, often represented in logic as \"If P, then Q\" or \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding\". This statement alone does not guarantee that Mary was at the wedding; it only guarantees that if Mary was there, then Sue was there too. The second statement, \"Sue was at the wedding\", confirms the presence of Sue but does not directly inform us about Mary's presence. The presence of Sue could be due to various reasons and does not necessarily depend on Mary being there, given the information provided. Therefore, from the given statements, we cannot logically conclude that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
