The conditional statement only guarantees that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train, but it does not guarantee that if Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane. In other words, there could be other reasons why Erin took a train that have nothing to do with Sam taking a plane. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that \"Sam took a plane\" is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
