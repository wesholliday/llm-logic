However, from these two statements, we cannot conclude that \"Alex finished the race\" is true. The conditional statement only guarantees that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race, but it does not guarantee that Alex finished the race if Chris finished the race. There might be other reasons why Chris finished the race that are unrelated to Alex's performance. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that Alex finished the race based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
