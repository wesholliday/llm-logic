            "content": "Explanation: This problem involves understanding the logical structure of conditional statements. The given statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana was yellow.\" The truth of this statement means that if A is true, then B must also be true. However, it does not imply that if B is true, then A must be true. This is because conditional statements do not assert the converse (if B, then A) to be true. The second given statement, \"The banana was yellow,\" confirms B but does not provide information about A. Since the truth of the conditional statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse, knowing that the banana was yellow does not logically imply that the apple was red.\n\nAnswer: no",
