            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to understand the structure of the given statements and how they relate to each other logically. The first statement, \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel,\" is a conditional statement. It can be represented as \"A \u2192 B,\" where A is \"the book was written by James\" and B is \"the book is a mystery novel.\" The second statement simply asserts that \"The book is a mystery novel\" is true, which means B is true.\n\nThe question asks whether it logically follows that \"The book was written by James\" (A) is true, given that the conditional statement (A \u2192 B) and the consequent (B) are true. In logic, the truth of the consequent (B) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (A) in a conditional statement. There could be other reasons why the book is a mystery novel (B is true) that have nothing to do with James being the author.\n\nFor example, the book could have been written by another author who also writes mystery novels. Therefore, knowing that the book is a mystery novel does not exclusively prove that it was written by James. The structure of the argument is an example of affirming the consequent, a logical fallacy that assumes because B follows A and B is true, A must also be true, which is not necessarily the case.\n\nAnswer: no",
