The statement \"Chris finished the race\" being true does not provide information about Alex's completion of the race. The conditional statement only works in one direction, from Alex to Chris, not the reverse. Therefore, knowing Chris finished does not necessarily mean Alex finished.\n\nAnswer: no",
