            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement, often represented in logic as \"If A, then B\" or A \u2192 B. This statement does not assert that A is true; it only asserts that if A is true, then B must also be true. The truth of B does not depend on A being true; B can be true regardless of A's truth value. The second statement, \"The banana was yellow,\" confirms that B is indeed true but does not provide any information about the truth of A (\"The apple was red\"). In logic, affirming the consequent (B) does not affirm the antecedent (A). Therefore, knowing that the banana was yellow does not necessarily mean that the apple was red.\n\nAnswer: no",
