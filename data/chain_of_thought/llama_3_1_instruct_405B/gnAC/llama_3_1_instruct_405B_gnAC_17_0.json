The truth of \"Kate ate salad\" does not necessarily imply that Ben ate pasta because Kate could have eaten salad regardless of what Ben ate. The conditional statement only provides information on one direction of the implication (Ben eating pasta implies Kate eating salad), not the reverse (Kate eating salad does not necessarily imply Ben eating pasta).\n\nAnswer: no",
