            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into logical premises and analyze the conclusion we're asked to draw. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as \"A \u2192 B,\" where A is \"the book was written by James\" and B is \"the book is a mystery novel.\" The second statement is a simple affirmation that \"The book is a mystery novel,\" which we know to be true (B is true).\n\nThe question asks if it necessarily follows that \"The book was written by James\" (A) is true, given that the book is indeed a mystery novel (B is true). In logic, the form of argument \"A \u2192 B; B; \u2234 A\" is known as affirming the consequent, which is a fallacy. This is because the truth of the consequent (B) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (A). There could be other reasons why the book is a mystery novel (other authors could have written it).\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we cannot logically conclude that \"The book was written by James\" is necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: no",
