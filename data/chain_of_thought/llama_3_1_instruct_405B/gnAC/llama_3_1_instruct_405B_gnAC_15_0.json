The truth of this statement only guarantees that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true. However, it does not imply that if the consequent is true, the antecedent must be true. In other words, Erin taking a train does not necessarily mean Sam took a plane; Erin could have taken a train regardless of Sam's mode of transportation. The second given statement, \"Erin took a train,\" confirms the consequent of the conditional statement but does not provide any direct information about Sam's actions.\n\nAnswer: no",
