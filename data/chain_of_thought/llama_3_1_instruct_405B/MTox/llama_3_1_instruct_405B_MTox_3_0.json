            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step. The first statement is \"The splat did not quank.\" This is a direct assertion about the splat's behavior or state, indicating that quanking is something the splat did not do. The second statement is \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\" This is a conditional statement that links the splat being morphed to the splat quanking. It implies that if the condition of the splat being morphed is true, then the consequence (the splat quanking) must also be true.\n\nGiven that we know the splat did not quank from the first statement, we can use this information to infer something about the condition in the second statement. If the splat quanking is the consequence of the splat being morphed, and we know that this consequence did not occur (the splat did not quank), then we can infer that the condition (the splat being morphed) must not have been true. This is because if the condition were true, we would expect the consequence to be true as well, based on the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, by combining the information from both statements, we can logically infer that the splat was not morphed, because if it were morphed, it would have quanked, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
