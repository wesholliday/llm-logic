            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the information given into logical statements. The first statement is \"The shank was not nugged,\" which we can denote as \"not N\" where N represents \"The shank was nugged.\" The second statement is \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged,\" which can be represented as \"P \u2192 N\" where P represents \"The shank was plooked.\"\n\nGiven these statements, we want to determine if we can infer \"The shank was not plooked,\" which is \"not P.\"\n\nUsing the rules of logical inference, specifically modus tollens, which states that from \"P \u2192 Q\" and \"not Q\" we can infer \"not P,\" we can apply this rule directly to our problem.\n\nWe have \"P \u2192 N\" and \"not N,\" so according to modus tollens, we can infer \"not P.\"\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can logically infer that \"The shank was not plooked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
