            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step. The first statement is \"The grommet did not plop the frink.\" This is a direct assertion about an action that did not happen. The second statement is \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\" This is a conditional statement that connects the condition of being sploffed to the action of plopping the frink. \n\nTo infer \"The grommet was not sploffed\" from these statements, we need to consider the relationship between being sploffed and plopping the frink as defined by the conditional statement. If being sploffed necessarily leads to plopping the frink (as per the conditional statement), and we know that the grommet did not plop the frink (from the first statement), then logically, the condition that would have led to the action (being sploffed) must not have occurred. This is because if the condition had occurred (the grommet was sploffed), then according to the conditional statement, the action (plopping the frink) would have followed, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nTherefore, by using modus tollens (a rule of logic that states if A implies B, and B is false, then A must be false), we can infer that the grommet was not sploffed because the consequence of being sploffed (plopping the frink) did not happen.\n\nAnswer: yes",
