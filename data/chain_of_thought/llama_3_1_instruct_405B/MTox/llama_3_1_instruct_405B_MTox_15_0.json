            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the information given into logical statements. Let's denote \"the dreb was spened\" as S, \"the dreb was vroombed\" as V, and \"the dreb was not spened\" as \u00acS (where \u00ac denotes \"not\").\n\n1. We are given that \"The dreb was not spened,\" which translates to \u00acS.\n2. We are also given \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened,\" which translates to V \u2192 S (where \u2192 denotes \"if-then\").\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The dreb was not vroombed\" (\u00acV) from these statements.\n\nUsing the given statements, we apply the rule of contrapositive inference. The contrapositive of V \u2192 S is \u00acS \u2192 \u00acV, meaning \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\nGiven that we know \u00acS (\"The dreb was not spened\"), we can use the contrapositive to infer \u00acV (\"The dreb was not vroombed\").\n\nAnswer: yes",
