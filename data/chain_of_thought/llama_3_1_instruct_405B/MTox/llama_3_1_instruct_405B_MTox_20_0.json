The first statement is \"The fleeg did not surn.\" This is a direct statement about the fleeg's action or state, indicating that surning did not occur. The second statement is \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\" This is a conditional statement that connects the state of being bluttered to the action of surning. It implies that if the fleeg is bluttered, surning is a consequence. Given that we know the fleeg did not surn, we can infer that the condition which would lead to surning (being bluttered) did not occur. This is because if the fleeg had been bluttered, it would have surned, according to the conditional statement. Since it did not surn, it suggests the initial condition (being bluttered) was not met.\n\nAnswer: yes",
