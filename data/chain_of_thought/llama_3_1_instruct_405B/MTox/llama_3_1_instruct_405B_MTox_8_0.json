            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the information given into logical statements and analyze the conclusion we can draw from them.\n\n1. The first statement is \"The sprocket was not daggled.\" This can be represented as \"Not D,\" where D stands for \"The sprocket was daggled.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\" This is a conditional statement that can be represented as \"If C, then D,\" where C stands for \"The sprocket was cranked.\"\n\nGiven these two statements, we can use logical reasoning to infer about the cranking of the sprocket. The second statement implies that cranking the sprocket leads to it being daggled. However, from the first statement, we know the sprocket was not daggled. \n\nUsing the principle of contrapositive inference (which states that if we have \"If A, then B\" and we know \"Not B,\" we can conclude \"Not A\"), we can infer that since the sprocket was not daggled (Not D), and if being cranked would have resulted in it being daggled (If C, then D), then the sprocket must not have been cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
