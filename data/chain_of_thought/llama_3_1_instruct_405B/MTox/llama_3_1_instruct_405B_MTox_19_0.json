The first statement is \"The smonk did not plagged.\" This statement directly tells us that whatever \"plagged\" means in this context, it did not happen to the smonk.\n\n2. The second statement is \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\" This is a conditional statement that connects being \"vreebled\" to \"plagged\" for the smonk. It implies that if the condition of being \"vreebled\" is true for the smonk, then it must also be true that the smonk \"plagged.\"\n\nGiven these two statements, we can use logical reasoning to infer about the relationship between being \"vreebled\" and \"plagged\" for the smonk. Since we know the smonk did not \"plagged\" from the first statement, and the second statement tells us that being \"vreebled\" leads to \"plagged,\" we can infer that the smonk was not \"vreebled.\" This is because if the smonk were \"vreebled,\" according to the second statement, it would have \"plagged,\" which contradicts the first statement.\n\nTherefore, logically, if the smonk did not \"plagged\" and being \"vreebled\" would lead to \"plagged,\" then the smonk must not have been \"vreebled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
