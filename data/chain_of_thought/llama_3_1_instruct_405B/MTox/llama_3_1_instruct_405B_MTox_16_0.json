            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the two statements. The first statement says, \"The sneg did not sproted the frink.\" This gives us a direct piece of information about the sneg's action (or lack thereof) regarding the frink. The second statement is a conditional statement: \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\" This tells us that being crampled is a condition that, if met, would result in the sneg sproted the frink.\n\nGiven that we know the sneg did not sproted the frink from the first statement, we can use this information to infer something about the condition in the second statement. If being crampled leads to sproted the frink, and we know the sneg did not sproted the frink, then it logically follows that the condition (being crampled) was not met. This is because if the condition were met (the sneg was crampled), we would expect the outcome (sproted the frink) to occur, which contradicts our first piece of information.\n\nTherefore, by combining these two pieces of information, we can infer that the sneg was not crampled, as this is the only scenario that does not contradict the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
