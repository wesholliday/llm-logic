The first statement is \"The whiffle is not tinked.\" This statement directly negates the condition of the whiffle being tinked. The second statement is \"Either the whiffle is shanked or it is tinked.\" This statement presents two possibilities for the whiffle: being shanked or being tinked. Since we know from the first statement that the whiffle is not tinked, we can eliminate the option of it being tinked from the second statement. This leaves us with the only possibility that the whiffle is shanked, as one of the two conditions must be true according to the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
