The first statement says, \"The grommet is not plopped.\" This gives us a clear condition about the state of the grommet regarding being \"plopped.\" The second statement says, \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it is plopped.\" This statement presents two possibilities for the state of the grommet: it is either sploffed or plopped. Given that we know from the first statement the grommet is not plopped, we can eliminate the \"plopped\" option from the second statement. This leaves us with the only possibility that the grommet is sploffed, as per the information provided.\n\nAnswer: yes",
