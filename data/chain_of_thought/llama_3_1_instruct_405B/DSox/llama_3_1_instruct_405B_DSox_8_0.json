The first statement is \"The sprocket is not daggled.\" This tells us directly about the state of the sprocket regarding being daggled. The second statement is \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it is daggled.\" This statement gives us two possibilities for the state of the sprocket: it is either cranked or daggled. Since we know from the first statement that the sprocket is not daggled, we can eliminate the \"daggled\" option from the second statement. This leaves us with the only possibility that the sprocket is cranked, according to the information provided.\n\nAnswer: yes",
