The first statement is \"The twonk is not plinked.\" This gives us a direct piece of information about the state of the twonk regarding being plinked. The second statement is \"Either the twonk is varnished or it is plinked.\" This statement presents two possibilities for the twonk: being varnished or being plinked. Since we know from the first statement that the twonk is not plinked, we can eliminate the option of it being plinked from the second statement. Therefore, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
