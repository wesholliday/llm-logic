The first statement is \"The smonk is not plagged.\" This gives us a direct piece of information about the smonk's state regarding being plagged. The second statement is \"Either the smonk is vreebled or it is plagged.\" This statement presents two possibilities for the smonk's state: being vreebled or being plagged. Since we know from the first statement that the smonk is not plagged, we can eliminate the option of being plagged from the second statement. Therefore, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
