            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step. The first statement is \"The splat is not quanked.\" This tells us directly that the condition of being quanked does not apply to the splat. The second statement is \"Either the splat is morphed or it is quanked.\" This statement presents two possibilities for the splat: being morphed or being quanked. Since we know from the first statement that the splat is not quanked, we can eliminate the \"quanked\" option from the second statement. This leaves us with the only possibility that the splat is morphed, as the second statement indicates that at least one of the two conditions (morphed or quanked) must apply.\n\nAnswer: yes",
