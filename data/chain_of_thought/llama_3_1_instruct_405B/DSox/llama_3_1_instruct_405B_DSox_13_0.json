The first statement says, \"The glip is not tragged.\" This gives us a direct piece of information about the state of the glip regarding being tragged. The second statement says, \"Either the glip is slogged or it is tragged.\" This statement presents two possibilities for the glip: being slogged or being tragged. Since we know from the first statement that the glip is not tragged, we can eliminate the option of the glip being tragged from the second statement. This leaves us with the only remaining option from the second statement, which is that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
