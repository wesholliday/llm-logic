The first statement says, \"The dreb is not spened.\" This gives us a clear piece of information about the state of the dreb regarding being spened. The second statement says, \"Either the dreb is vroombed or it is spened.\" This statement presents two possibilities for the state of the dreb: it is either vroombed or spened. Given that we know from the first statement the dreb is not spened, we can eliminate the option of the dreb being spened from the second statement. Therefore, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
