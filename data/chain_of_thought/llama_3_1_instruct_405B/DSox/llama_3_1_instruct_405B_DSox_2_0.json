The first statement, \"The wug is not bimmed,\" directly tells us the state of the wug regarding being bimmed. The second statement, \"Either the wug is flooped or it is bimmed,\" presents two possibilities for the wug's state. Since we know from the first statement that the wug is not bimmed, we can eliminate the \"it is bimmed\" option from the second statement. This leaves us with the only possibility that \"the wug is flooped\" from the given alternatives in the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
