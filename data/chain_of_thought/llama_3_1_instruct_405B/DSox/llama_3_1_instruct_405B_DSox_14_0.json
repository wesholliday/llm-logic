The first statement, \"The clug is not snugged,\" directly tells us the state of the clug regarding being snugged. The second statement, \"Either the clug is fleeked or it is snugged,\" presents two possibilities for the state of the clug. Since we know from the first statement that the clug is not snugged, we can eliminate that option from the second statement. This leaves us with the only remaining possibility from the second statement, which is that the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
