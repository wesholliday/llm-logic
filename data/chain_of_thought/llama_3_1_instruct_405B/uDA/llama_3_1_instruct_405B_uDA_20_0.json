            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a conditional statement and a negation of the antecedent. The first statement says, \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be represented as \"A \u2192 B,\" where A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana was yellow.\" The second statement says, \"The apple was not red,\" which can be represented as \"\u00acA.\" From these statements, we cannot logically infer that \"the banana was not yellow\" (\u00acB) because the condition that would lead us to conclude the banana's color (the apple being red) is not met. The conclusion that the banana was not yellow would require additional information that directly addresses the banana's color or a different logical path. The given information only tells us that the condition for the banana being yellow (the apple being red) is not fulfilled, but it does not provide a direct conclusion about the banana's color when the apple is not red.\n\nAnswer: no",
