            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" and \"the vampire was not awake.\" The first statement sets up a conditional relationship where the wakefulness of the vampire implies the wakefulness of the mummy. However, it does not state that the mummy's wakefulness is dependent solely on the vampire's wakefulness. The second statement tells us that the vampire was not awake. From this, we cannot directly infer the state of the mummy because the conditional statement only provides information about the scenario in which the vampire is awake. It does not address scenarios where the vampire is not awake. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that the mummy was not awake based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
