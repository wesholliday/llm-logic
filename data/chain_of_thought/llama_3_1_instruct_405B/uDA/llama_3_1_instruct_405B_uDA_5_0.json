            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into logical premises and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This is a conditional statement that can be represented as \"Jeff played basketball \u2192 Amy played tennis.\" It implies that if the condition (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the consequence (Amy playing tennis) must also be true. However, it does not guarantee the truth of the consequence if the condition is false.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Jeff did not play basketball.\" This directly negates the condition of the first statement.\n\nGiven these premises, we cannot infer that Amy did not play tennis based solely on the information that Jeff did not play basketball. The first statement only guarantees Amy played tennis if Jeff played basketball, but it does not provide information about Amy's actions if Jeff did not play basketball. Amy could have played tennis or not; the information given does not specify.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that Amy did not play tennis from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
