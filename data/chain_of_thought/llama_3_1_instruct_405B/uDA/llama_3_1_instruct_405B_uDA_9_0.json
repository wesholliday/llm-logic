            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" and \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" The first statement sets up a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. However, since the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is not met according to the second statement, we cannot conclude that Mark bought the blue shirt based on the given conditional statement. The information provided does not directly tell us what Mark bought or did not buy if Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that Mark did not buy the blue shirt based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
