            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the information given into logical statements. The first statement is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be represented as \"Mary \u2192 Sue\" (meaning if Mary was there, then Sue was there). The second statement is \"Mary was not at the wedding,\" which can be represented as \"\u00acMary\" (meaning Mary was not there).\n\nFrom the first statement, we understand that Mary's presence guarantees Sue's presence, but it does not say anything about Sue's presence if Mary is not there. It's a one-way implication. \n\nGiven that Mary was not at the wedding (\u00acMary), we cannot infer anything about Sue's presence or absence based on the given statements because the condition that triggers the implication (Mary being at the wedding) is not met. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that Sue was not at the wedding based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
