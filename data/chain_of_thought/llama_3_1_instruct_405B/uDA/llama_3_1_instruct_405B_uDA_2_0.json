            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the information given step by step. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This means the presence of the griffin in the forest guarantees the presence of the unicorn in the forest. However, it does not guarantee the absence of the unicorn if the griffin is not in the forest. The second statement tells us that \"the griffin was not in the forest.\" From this, we cannot infer the location of the unicorn because the conditional statement only provides information about the scenario where the griffin is in the forest, not where it is not. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude the unicorn was not in the forest based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
