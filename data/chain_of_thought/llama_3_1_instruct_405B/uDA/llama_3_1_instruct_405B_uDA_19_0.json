            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the information given into logical statements. The first statement is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This can be represented as \"Tom watched football \u2192 Jen watched basketball.\" The second statement is \"Tom did not watch football.\" From these statements, we cannot directly infer that Jen did not watch basketball because the condition that would lead us to conclude Jen watched basketball (Tom watching football) is not met. However, this does not provide any information about what Jen did if Tom did not watch football. Jen could have watched basketball or not; the information given does not specify her actions in the scenario where Tom does not watch football. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that Jen did not watch basketball based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
