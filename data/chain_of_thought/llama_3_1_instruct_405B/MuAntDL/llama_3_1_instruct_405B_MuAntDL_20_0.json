'Or' is a logical operator that indicates a choice between two alternatives. In this case, 'formal or semi-formal' means the event could be either formal, semi-formal, or possibly something that combines elements of both, but it does not exclusively mean it must have been formal. There is an option for it to be semi-formal, which is distinct from being strictly formal.\n\nAnswer: no",
