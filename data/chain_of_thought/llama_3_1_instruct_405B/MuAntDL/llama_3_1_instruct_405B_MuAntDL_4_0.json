            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM or cancelled\" implies that there are two possible scenarios for the meeting: it was either held at 2 PM or it was cancelled. This statement does not definitively confirm that the meeting took place at 2 PM; rather, it presents two alternatives, one of which is that the meeting was cancelled. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM\" based solely on the given statement, as it explicitly allows for the possibility of cancellation.\n\nAnswer: no",
