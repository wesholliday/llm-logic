            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The keys must have been in the drawer or on the table\" implies that there are two possible locations for the keys: the drawer or the table. The use of \"or\" indicates that the keys could be in either location, but it does not guarantee that they are in one specific location. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The keys must have been in the drawer\" because the keys could also have been on the table.\n\nAnswer: no",
