            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday or extended\" implies that there are two possible outcomes for the project by Friday: it was either completed or it was extended. The statement does not definitively say the project was completed by Friday; it provides an alternative scenario where the project could have been extended instead. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that \"The project must have been completed by Friday\" because the original statement allows for the possibility of extension, which does not necessarily mean completion.\n\nAnswer: no",
