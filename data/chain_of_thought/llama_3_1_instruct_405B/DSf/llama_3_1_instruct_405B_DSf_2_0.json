            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the information given into logical statements and analyze the conclusion we can draw from them.\n\n1. The first statement is \"Either the book is resting on the table or it is on the shelf.\" This can be represented logically as \"A or B,\" where A is \"the book is resting on the table\" and B is \"the book is on the shelf.\" This kind of statement is known as a disjunction.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The book isn't resting on the table.\" This directly negates A, so we have \"not A.\"\n\nGiven these two statements, we can apply a logical rule known as disjunctive syllogism. Disjunctive syllogism states that if we have \"A or B\" and \"not A,\" we can conclude B. This is because in a disjunction (\"or\" statement), only one of the options needs to be true for the whole statement to be true. If we know one of the options is not true (in this case, A), then the other option must be true for the disjunction to hold.\n\nTherefore, applying disjunctive syllogism to our statements, we can conclude that if the book isn't resting on the table, and it must either be on the table or on the shelf, then it must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
