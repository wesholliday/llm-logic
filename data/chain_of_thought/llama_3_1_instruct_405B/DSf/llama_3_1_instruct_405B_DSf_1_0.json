            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the information given and apply basic logical principles. The first statement is a disjunction: \"Either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside.\" This means that at least one of these conditions must be true. The second statement is a negation of one of the conditions in the disjunction: \"Fido is not in the garden.\" By negating one part of the disjunction, we are left with the other part as the only possibility, given that the disjunction stipulates that at least one of the conditions must be true.\n\nTherefore, if we know that Fido cannot be in the garden (because that option is negated), the only remaining option from the original disjunction is that Fido must be inside. This is a straightforward application of the principle of disjunctive syllogism, which states that if one of the options in a disjunction is proven false, the other option must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
