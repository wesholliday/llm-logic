            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the information given into logical statements and analyze the conclusion that can be drawn from them.\n\n1. The first statement is \"Either the newspaper is sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway.\" This can be represented logically as P \u2228 D, where P represents \"the newspaper is sitting on the porch\" and D represents \"the newspaper is in the driveway.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"The newspaper isn't sitting on the porch,\" which can be represented logically as \u00acP (not P).\n\nGiven these two statements, we can apply a logical rule known as disjunctive syllogism. Disjunctive syllogism states that if we have P \u2228 Q and \u00acP, we can conclude Q. Applying this rule to our statements:\n\n- We have P \u2228 D (Either the newspaper is sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway)\n- And we have \u00acP (The newspaper isn't sitting on the porch)\n\nUsing disjunctive syllogism, we can conclude D, which means \"The newspaper is in the driveway.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
