            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the information given into logical steps. The first statement is a disjunction (an \"or\" statement), giving us two possible locations for the remote control: under the couch or on the coffee table. The second statement negates one of these possibilities, stating that the remote control is not under the couch. \n\nGiven the structure of the first statement as an \"either/or\" scenario, when one option is eliminated, we are logically left with the other option as the only remaining possibility. This is based on the principle of disjunctive syllogism, which states that if we have \"A or B\" and \"not A,\" we can conclude \"B.\"\n\nTherefore, by eliminating the possibility that the remote control is under the couch, we are left with the conclusion that it must be on the coffee table, based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: yes",
