            "content": "Explanation: To approach this question, let's break down the meaning of the statements involved. \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" implies that there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza. This statement acknowledges that there are multiple possibilities regarding Sue's choice, including the possibility that she did not choose pizza.\n\nOn the other hand, \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" directly negates the necessity of Sue choosing pizza. Saying \"Sue must have chosen pizza\" would mean that there is no other possibility but that Sue chose pizza. By negating this, we are saying that it is not a necessity, or in other words, there are scenarios where Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nGiven that \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" introduces the possibility of Sue not choosing pizza, it directly contradicts the idea that choosing pizza was a necessity for Sue. Therefore, if there's a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza, it cannot be a must for her to have chosen pizza. This aligns with the statement \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
