            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the statements. The original statement is \"The milk might not be on the counter.\" This implies that there is a possibility that the milk is not on the counter, but it does not rule out the possibility that the milk could be on the counter. It suggests uncertainty about the milk's location.\n\nThe statement we are asked to infer is \"It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter.\" This statement directly challenges the necessity of the milk being on the counter, suggesting that there is no requirement or obligation for the milk to be there.\n\nGiven the original statement's implication of uncertainty about the milk's location, it naturally follows that we cannot assert the milk must be on the counter. If there's a possibility the milk is not on the counter, then it cannot be a necessity for the milk to be there.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"The milk might not be on the counter,\" we can indeed infer \"It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
