            "content": "Explanation: To approach this question, let's break down the meaning of the statements involved. \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" implies that there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding. This statement acknowledges uncertainty about Mary's attendance, suggesting that it's either unknown or not confirmed whether she was there.\n\nOn the other hand, \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" directly negates the necessity of Mary's attendance. Saying \"Mary must have been at the wedding\" would mean it is certain or necessary that she was there. By negating this, we're saying it's not necessary or certain that she was there.\n\nGiven the first statement acknowledges a possibility of Mary not being at the wedding, it directly contradicts the idea that it is necessary or certain that she was there. Therefore, if Mary might not have been at the wedding, it logically follows that it's not the case that she must have been there, as the first statement introduces doubt or uncertainty about her attendance.\n\nAnswer: yes",
