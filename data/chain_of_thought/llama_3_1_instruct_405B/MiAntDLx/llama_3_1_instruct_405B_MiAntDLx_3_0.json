The statement 'The plimp might be in the wump or on the snorkel' is a disjunction, meaning it presents two possibilities connected by 'or.' In logic, when we say 'A or B,' we mean that at least one of the statements A or B is true. Therefore, from the given statement, we can infer that it is possible for the plimp to be in the wump, as this is one of the presented possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes",
