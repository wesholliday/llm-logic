The statement 'The blurble might be blimple by zizz or zazzle' implies that there are two possible ways the blurble could be blimple: by zizz or by zazzle. The use of 'or' indicates that either of these options is a possibility. Therefore, we can logically infer that 'The blurble might be blimple by zizz' is a possible scenario, as it is one of the two options presented in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
