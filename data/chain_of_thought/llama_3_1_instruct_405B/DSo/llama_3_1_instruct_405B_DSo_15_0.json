The first statement says, \"The shoes aren't lined up by the door.\" This gives us a clear piece of information about the location of the shoes - they are not by the door. The second statement provides two possible locations for the shoes: either they are in the closet or they are lined up by the door. Since we already know from the first statement that the shoes are not lined up by the door, we can eliminate that option from the second statement. This leaves us with only one possibility from the second statement: the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
