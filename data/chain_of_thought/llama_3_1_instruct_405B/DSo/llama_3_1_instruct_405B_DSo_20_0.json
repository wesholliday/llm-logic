The first statement says, \"The sunglasses aren't perched on her head.\" This gives us a clear piece of information about the location of the sunglasses - they are not on her head. The second statement is, \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they are perched on her head.\" This statement gives us two possible locations for the sunglasses: in her bag or on her head. However, we already know from the first statement that the sunglasses are not on her head. Therefore, when considering the two options given in the second statement, we can eliminate the option that the sunglasses are on her head because it contradicts the first statement. This leaves us with only one possible location for the sunglasses according to the information provided: in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
