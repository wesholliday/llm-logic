The first statement is \"The watch isn't on his wrist.\" This tells us the location of the watch is not on the person's wrist. The second statement is \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist.\" This gives us two possible locations for the watch: charging on the dresser or on his wrist. Since we know from the first statement that the watch is not on his wrist, we can eliminate that option from the second statement. Therefore, the only remaining option for the location of the watch is that it is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
