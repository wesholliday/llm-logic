            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the information given. The first statement is \"The book isn't resting on the table,\" which directly negates the possibility of the book being on the table. The second statement is \"Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table,\" which presents two possibilities for the book's location. Given that the first statement eliminates one of the options presented in the second statement (the book resting on the table), we are left with the only other possibility mentioned: the book being on the shelf. This is a classic application of the disjunctive syllogism, a form of argument that is logically valid. The disjunctive syllogism works as follows: if we have \"Either A or B\" and \"Not A,\" we can logically conclude \"B.\" Applying this to our scenario, \"A\" would be \"the book is resting on the table\" and \"B\" would be \"the book is on the shelf.\" Since we know the book isn't resting on the table (Not A), we can conclude the book is on the shelf (B).\n\nAnswer: yes",
