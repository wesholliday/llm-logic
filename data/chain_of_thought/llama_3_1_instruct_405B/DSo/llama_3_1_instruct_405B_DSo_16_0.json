The first statement, \"The pen isn't on my desk,\" directly tells us the location where the pen is not. The second statement, \"Either the pen is in my bag or it is on my desk,\" gives us two possible locations for the pen. Since we know from the first statement that the pen is not on the desk, we can eliminate that option from the second statement. This leaves us with the only remaining option from the second statement, which is that the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
