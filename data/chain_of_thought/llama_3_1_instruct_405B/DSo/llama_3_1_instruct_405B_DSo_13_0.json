The second statement is \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf.\" This gives us two possible locations for the toy: in the toy box or on the shelf. Since we know from the first statement that the toy is not on the shelf, we can eliminate that option from the second statement. \n\nAnswer: yes",
