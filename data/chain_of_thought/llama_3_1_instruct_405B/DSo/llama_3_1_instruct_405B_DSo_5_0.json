The first statement, \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry,\" directly tells us the location where the cookies are not. The second statement, \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry,\" gives us two possible locations for the cookies. Since we know from the first statement that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, we can eliminate that option from the second statement. This leaves us with the only remaining option from the second statement, which is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
