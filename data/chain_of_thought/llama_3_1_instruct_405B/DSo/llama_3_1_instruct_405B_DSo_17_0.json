The first statement, \"The scarf isn't draped on the coat rack,\" provides direct information about the location of the scarf, telling us where it is not. The second statement, \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it is draped on the coat rack,\" gives us two possible locations for the scarf. Since we know from the first statement that the scarf is not draped on the coat rack, we can eliminate that option from the second statement. This leaves us with the only remaining possibility from the second statement, which is that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
