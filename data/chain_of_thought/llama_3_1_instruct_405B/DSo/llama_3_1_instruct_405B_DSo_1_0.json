The second statement is \"Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden,\" which gives us two possible locations for Fido: inside or in the garden. Since we know from the first statement that Fido is not in the garden, we can eliminate that option from the second statement. This leaves us with the only possibility that Fido is inside, as the second statement presents these two options as the only possibilities and one has been ruled out.\n\nAnswer: yes",
