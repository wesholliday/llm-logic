The second statement is \"Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it is sitting on the porch.\" This gives us two possible locations for the newspaper. Since we know from the first statement that the newspaper is not on the porch, we can eliminate that option from the second statement. Therefore, the only remaining possibility from the options given is that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes",
