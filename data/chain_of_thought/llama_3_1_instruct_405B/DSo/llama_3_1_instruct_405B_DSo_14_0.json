The first statement, \"The milk isn't chilling in the fridge,\" directly tells us the location of the milk is not in the fridge for chilling. The second statement, \"Either the milk is on the counter or it is chilling in the fridge,\" gives us two possible locations for the milk: on the counter or chilling in the fridge. Since the first statement eliminates the possibility of the milk chilling in the fridge, we are left with only one option from the second statement, which is that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
