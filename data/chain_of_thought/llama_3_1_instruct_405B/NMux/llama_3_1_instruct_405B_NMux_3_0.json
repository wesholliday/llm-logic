The original statement is \"It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed.\" This can be understood as negating the necessity of the splat being morphed. In logical terms, if we denote \"the splat must have been morphed\" as \"M\", then the original statement is \"not M\" or \"\u00acM\".\n\nThe statement we're trying to infer is \"The splat might not have been morphed.\" This statement suggests the possibility of the splat not being morphed. In logical terms, if we denote \"the splat has been morphed\" as \"m\", then the statement we're trying to infer is \"it's possible that not m\" or \"\u25c7\u00acm\".\n\nThe original statement negates the necessity of the splat being morphed, which implies that there is no requirement or obligation for the splat to have been morphed. This naturally leads to the possibility that the splat might not have been morphed, because if there's no necessity for it to be morphed, then it's possible for it not to be morphed.\n\nTherefore, from \"It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed,\" we can logically infer \"The splat might not have been morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
