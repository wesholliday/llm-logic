            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the information given. The first statement, \"The truck might not have been metal,\" implies that there is a possibility that the truck was not made of metal. The second statement, \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal,\" sets up a conditional relationship where if the doll is plastic, then it is necessary that the truck is metal. \n\nTo infer \"The doll was not plastic,\" we need to consider if the information provided logically leads to this conclusion. If the doll was plastic, according to the second statement, the truck must have been metal. However, the first statement introduces uncertainty about the material of the truck, suggesting it might not have been metal. \n\nGiven that the truck's material is uncertain and could \"not have been metal,\" this situation contradicts the condition that if the doll was plastic, the truck must have been metal. Since we cannot have a situation where the doll is plastic and the truck is not metal according to the given condition, and we are told the truck might not have been metal, we can logically infer that the doll was not plastic. This is because if the doll were plastic, it would necessitate a metal truck, which contradicts the given uncertainty about the truck's material.\n\nAnswer: yes",
