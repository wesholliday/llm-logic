The first statement, \"The muffins might not have been blueberry,\" suggests that there is a possibility that the muffins were not blueberry, but it does not rule out the possibility that they were blueberry. The second statement, \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry,\" sets up a conditional relationship where if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are definitely blueberry. \n\nGiven that the muffins might not have been blueberry, if we assume the cake was chocolate, this contradicts the possibility that the muffins might not have been blueberry because, according to the conditional statement, if the cake is chocolate, the muffins must be blueberry. Therefore, to maintain the truth of both statements, we must conclude that the cake was not chocolate, because if it were, it would eliminate the possibility that the muffins might not have been blueberry.\n\nAnswer: yes",
