            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step. The first statement, \"Sue might not have been at the wedding,\" implies that there is a possibility that Sue was not at the wedding. It does not confirm her absence but leaves open the possibility. The second statement, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding,\" establishes a conditional relationship between Mary's and Sue's attendance. It means if Mary was there, Sue definitely was there. Now, considering the possibility that Sue might not have been at the wedding (from the first statement), if we apply this to the conditional relationship stated in the second statement, we cannot directly infer that Mary was not at the wedding solely based on the possibility that Sue might not have been there. The conditional statement only guarantees Sue's presence if Mary was there, but it does not provide a basis to conclude Mary's absence based on the mere possibility of Sue's absence. Therefore, we cannot logically infer \"Mary was not at the wedding\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
