            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the information given. The first statement, \"The pants might not have been denim,\" suggests that there is a possibility that the pants were not made of denim, but it does not rule out the possibility that they were denim. The second statement, \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim,\" establishes a conditional relationship between the material of the shirt and the pants. It implies that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants have to be denim. \n\nGiven that the pants might not have been denim, if we assume the shirt was cotton, this would contradict the condition that if the shirt is cotton, the pants must be denim. Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton, because if it were, the pants would have to be denim, which contradicts the initial statement that the pants might not have been denim.\n\nAnswer: yes",
