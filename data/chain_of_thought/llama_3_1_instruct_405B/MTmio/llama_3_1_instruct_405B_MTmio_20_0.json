            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the information given. The first statement, \"The banana might not have been yellow,\" suggests that there is a possibility that the banana was not yellow. The second statement, \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow,\" establishes a conditional relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana. It implies that if the apple was indeed red, then the banana had to be yellow.\n\nGiven that we know the banana might not have been yellow, we can use this to infer something about the color of the apple. If the banana was not yellow, then according to the conditional statement, the apple could not have been red because if the apple was red, the banana would have to be yellow.\n\nTherefore, from the information provided, we can logically infer that since there's a possibility the banana was not yellow, and given the conditional relationship that if the apple was red the banana must be yellow, the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
