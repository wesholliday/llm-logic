            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step. The first statement, \"The mummy might not have been awake,\" suggests that there is a possibility that the mummy was not awake. This can be represented as \"It is possible that the mummy was not awake.\" The second statement, \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake,\" establishes a conditional relationship between the vampire's state and the mummy's state. It implies that if the vampire was awake, then it is certain that the mummy was awake.\n\nNow, let's consider the inference \"The vampire was not awake.\" To determine if this can be logically inferred from the given statements, we need to see if the negation of \"The vampire was awake\" (which is \"The vampire was not awake\") logically follows from the information provided.\n\nIf the vampire was awake, it necessitates the mummy being awake (from the second statement). However, since we know from the first statement that there's a possibility the mummy might not have been awake, this situation (the mummy not being awake) contradicts the outcome required by the condition \"If the vampire was awake.\" Therefore, for the mummy to possibly not have been awake (as per the first statement), the condition that necessitates the mummy's wakefulness (the vampire being awake) must not have occurred.\n\nThus, logically, if there's a possibility the mummy wasn't awake, and the vampire being awake would negate that possibility by necessitating the mummy's wakefulness, we can infer that the vampire was not awake to maintain the possibility of the mummy not being awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
