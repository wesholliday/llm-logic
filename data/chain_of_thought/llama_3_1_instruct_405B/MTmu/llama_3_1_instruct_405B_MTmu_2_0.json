            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the statements into logical expressions. Let G represent \"the griffin was in the forest\" and U represent \"the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" The first statement is \"If G, then U,\" which can be represented as G \u2192 U. The second statement is \"It's not the case that U,\" which can be represented as \u00acU (not U).\n\nFrom the first statement, G \u2192 U, we can infer that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been there too. However, from the second statement, we know that it's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest (\u00acU).\n\nTo infer that \"The griffin was not in the forest\" (\u00acG) from these statements, we need to consider the logical implications. The statement G \u2192 U does not directly tell us that G is false if U is false; it only tells us that if G is true, U must be true. However, if U is false (as given by \u00acU), we can use the principle of modus tollens, which states that if we have G \u2192 U and \u00acU, we can conclude \u00acG.\n\nTherefore, given that we have G \u2192 U and \u00acU, we can logically infer \u00acG, which means \"The griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
