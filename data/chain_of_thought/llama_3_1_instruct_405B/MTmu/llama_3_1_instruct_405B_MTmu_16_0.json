            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into logical expressions. Let's denote \"the shirt was cotton\" as C and \"the pants must have been denim\" as D. The first statement, \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim,\" can be expressed as C \u2192 D. The second statement, \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim,\" can be expressed as \u00acD (not D).\n\nFrom the first statement, C \u2192 D, we can infer that if the pants were not denim (\u00acD), then the shirt was not cotton (\u00acC) because in a conditional statement, if the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false for the statement to hold true. This is based on the logical rule of contrapositive inference, which states that from C \u2192 D, we can infer \u00acD \u2192 \u00acC.\n\nGiven that we have \u00acD (it's not the case that the pants must have been denim), we can use the contrapositive of the first statement to infer \u00acC (the shirt was not cotton).\n\nAnswer: yes",
