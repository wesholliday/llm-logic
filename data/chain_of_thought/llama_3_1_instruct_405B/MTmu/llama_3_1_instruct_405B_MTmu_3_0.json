            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the book was written by James\" and B is \"the book must be a mystery novel.\" This statement implies that if James wrote the book, it is necessarily a mystery novel.\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\" This statement negates the necessity of the book being a mystery novel, meaning the book could be something other than a mystery novel.\n\n3. To infer \"The book was not written by James\" from these statements, we need to consider the implications of the second statement on the first. If it's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel, and if being written by James necessitates it being a mystery novel, then logically, the condition that leads to it being a necessary mystery novel (James writing it) cannot be true.\n\n4. This is because if James had written the book, it would have to be a mystery novel (by the first statement), but we know it's not necessarily a mystery novel (from the second statement). Therefore, the premise that James wrote the book must be false, leading to the conclusion that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
