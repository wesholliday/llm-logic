            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" - This statement establishes a conditional relationship where Mary's presence at the wedding implies Sue's presence. It does not, however, make any claims about Sue's presence if Mary is not at the wedding.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding\" - This statement negates the necessity of Sue's presence at the wedding. It implies that there are scenarios where Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nGiven these two statements, we want to infer whether \"Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that Mary's presence guarantees Sue's presence. The second statement tells us that Sue's presence is not guaranteed, which indirectly suggests that the condition which guarantees Sue's presence (Mary's presence) might not have occurred.\n\nHowever, the logic here is a bit tricky. The second statement does not directly tell us that Sue was not at the wedding; it only tells us that it's not necessary for Sue to have been at the wedding. There could still be a scenario where Sue was at the wedding without Mary's presence being the reason (since the first statement does not cover Sue's presence in the absence of Mary).\n\nBut, considering the conditional statement and its contrapositive, if Sue was not necessarily at the wedding, and if Mary's presence would necessitate Sue's presence, then we can infer that Mary could not have been at the wedding because her presence would have made Sue's presence necessary, which contradicts the given information.\n\nTherefore, the absence of the necessity of Sue's presence, combined with the conditional that Mary's presence would make Sue's presence necessary, leads us to conclude that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
