            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into logical expressions. Let B represent \"the bear was in the cave\" and W represent \"the wolf was in the den.\" The first statement, \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den,\" can be represented as B \u2192 W. The second statement, \"It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den,\" can be represented as \u00acW (not W), since it directly negates the necessity of W being true.\n\nGiven these representations, we can analyze the logical structure of the argument. The conclusion we are asked to evaluate is whether we can infer \"The bear was not in the cave,\" which would be represented as \u00acB.\n\nThe argument structure is as follows:\n1. B \u2192 W\n2. \u00acW\n\u2234 \u00acB?\n\nThis is a classic example of a valid logical argument form known as Modus Tollens, which has the structure:\n1. P \u2192 Q\n2. \u00acQ\n\u2234 \u00acP\n\nSince our argument fits this form, where P = B and Q = W, we can conclude that the inference is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
