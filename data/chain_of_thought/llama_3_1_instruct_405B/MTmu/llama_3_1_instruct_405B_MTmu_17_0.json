            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements into logical expressions. The first statement, \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten the salad,\" can be represented as \"P \u2192 S,\" where P stands for \"Ben ate pasta\" and S stands for \"Kate must have eaten the salad.\" The second statement, \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad,\" can be represented as \"\u00acS,\" where \u00ac denotes negation.\n\nFrom the first statement, we have a conditional statement that only tells us something about Kate eating the salad if Ben ate pasta. It does not provide information about what happens if Ben did not eat pasta. The second statement tells us that Kate did not eat the salad.\n\nTo infer that \"Ben did not eat pasta\" from these statements, we would need to conclude \u00acP from \u00acS. However, the original conditional statement P \u2192 S only allows us to conclude \u00acP if we know both the conditional P \u2192 S and \u00acS, and we apply the logical rule of modus tollens, which states that from P \u2192 S and \u00acS, we can infer \u00acP.\n\nGiven that we have both the conditional statement and the negation of its consequent (\u00acS), we can indeed apply modus tollens to infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
