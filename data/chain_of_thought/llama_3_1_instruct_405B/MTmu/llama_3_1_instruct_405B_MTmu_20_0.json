            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements into logical form. The first statement is \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" This can be represented as \"A \u2192 B\" where A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana must have been yellow.\" The second statement is \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow,\" which can be represented as \"\u00acB\" (not B).\n\nIn classical logic, from A \u2192 B and \u00acB, we can infer \u00acA (not A) through a process called modus tollens. Modus tollens is a rule of logic that states if we have \"If A, then B\" and \"not B,\" we can conclude \"not A.\"\n\nTherefore, applying modus tollens to our statements, from \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" (A \u2192 B) and \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow\" (\u00acB), we can infer \"The apple was not red\" (\u00acA).\n\nAnswer: yes",
