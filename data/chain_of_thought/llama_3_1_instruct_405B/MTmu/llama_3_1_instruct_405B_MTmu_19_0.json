            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement in the form of \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"Tom watched football\" and B is \"Jen must have watched basketball.\" This statement implies that if A is true, then B must also be true. However, it does not guarantee the truth of A or B individually.\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\" This statement negates the conclusion of the first statement, implying that B (\"Jen must have watched basketball\") is not necessarily true.\n\n3. To infer \"Tom did not watch football\" from these statements, we would need to establish that because Jen did not necessarily watch basketball, Tom could not have watched football. This is essentially using the negation of the conclusion (B) to negate the premise (A).\n\n4. In logic, the form of argument \"If A, then B; Not B; Therefore, Not A\" is a valid form of argument known as modus tollens. It allows us to conclude the negation of the premise (Not A) from the negation of the conclusion (Not B) in a conditional statement.\n\nGiven the information and applying modus tollens, we can infer that since it's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball (Not B), and if Tom watching football implies Jen must have watched basketball (If A, then B), then Tom did not watch football (Not A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
