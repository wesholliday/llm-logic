            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements into logical expressions to analyze the inference.\n\n1. \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake\" can be expressed as: V \u2192 M (where V represents \"the vampire was awake\" and M represents \"the mummy must have been awake\").\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake\" can be expressed as: \u00acM (where \u00ac represents negation, meaning \"it's not the case that\").\n\nWe are trying to infer \"The vampire was not awake,\" which can be expressed as: \u00acV.\n\nFrom the first statement, we have a conditional (V \u2192 M), and from the second statement, we have the negation of the consequent of that conditional (\u00acM). In classical logic, from V \u2192 M and \u00acM, we can infer \u00acV through a process called modus tollens, which states that if we have a conditional and the negation of its consequent, we can infer the negation of its antecedent.\n\nTherefore, given the statements \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake\" and \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake,\" we can logically infer \"The vampire was not awake.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
