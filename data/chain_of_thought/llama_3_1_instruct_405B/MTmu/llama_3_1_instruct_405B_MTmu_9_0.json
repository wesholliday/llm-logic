            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and B is \"Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This statement implies that if A is true, then B must also be true. However, it does not guarantee the truth of A or B individually.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This statement negates the conclusion of the first statement. It tells us that it is not necessary or guaranteed that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that since the condition that necessitates Mark buying the blue shirt (Lisa buying the red shirt) does not lead to a guaranteed outcome (Mark must have bought the blue shirt), the initial condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) cannot be affirmed based on the necessity of the outcome. However, the negation of the outcome (it's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt) suggests that the condition which would necessitate this outcome (Lisa buying the red shirt) did not occur, because if it had, then according to the first statement, Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can logically infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt because if she had, it would lead to a contradiction with the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
