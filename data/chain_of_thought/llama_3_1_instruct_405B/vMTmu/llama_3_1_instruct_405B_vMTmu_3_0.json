            "content": "Explanation: To determine the logical validity of the argument, we need to examine its form. The argument can be represented symbolically as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q (If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel)\n2. Not Q (It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel)\n3. Therefore, Not P (The book was not written by James)\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. Modus Tollens states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not Q\", we can logically conclude \"Not P\". The argument fits this form perfectly.\n\nAnswer: yes",
