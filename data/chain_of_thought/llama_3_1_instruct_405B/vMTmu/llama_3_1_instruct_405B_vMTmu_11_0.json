            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument can be represented in a symbolic form as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q (If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry)\n2. Not Q (It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry)\n3. Therefore, Not P (The cake was not chocolate)\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. Modus Tollens states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not Q\", we can logically conclude \"Not P\". The reasoning is that if the condition (P) leads to a consequence (Q) that we know is false, then the condition itself must be false because if it were true, it would lead to a known falsehood.\n\nAnswer: yes",
