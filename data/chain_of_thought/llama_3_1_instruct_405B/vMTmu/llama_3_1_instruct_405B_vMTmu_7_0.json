            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument can be symbolized as follows:\n\n1. If A, then C (If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race)\n2. Not C (It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race)\n3. Therefore, Not A (Alex did not finish the race)\n\nThis argument form is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. Modus Tollens has the form:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Not Q\n3. Therefore, Not P\n\nGiven the premises, the conclusion logically follows because if Chris must finish the race for Alex to finish, and Chris did not finish, then it logically follows that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
