            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument can be represented in a symbolic form as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q (If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta)\n2. Not Q (It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta)\n3. Therefore, Not P (Sue did not choose pizza)\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. Modus Tollens has the following structure:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Not Q\n3. Therefore, Not P\n\nIn this structure, if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. The validity of Modus Tollens can be understood through the following reasoning: if P implies Q, and Q is not the case, then P cannot be the case because if it were, Q would have to be the case as well, which contradicts the second premise.\n\nGiven that the argument in question follows the Modus Tollens form, it is logically valid. This means that if the premises are true, the conclusion necessarily follows as true as well.\n\nAnswer: yes",
