            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument can be represented in a symbolic form as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q (If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue)\n2. Not Q (It's not the case that the truck must have been blue)\n3. Therefore, Not P (The car was not red)\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. Modus Tollens has the following structure:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Not Q\n3. Therefore, Not P\n\nIn this structure, if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. The validity of Modus Tollens can be understood through the following reasoning: if P implies Q, and Q is not the case, then it must be that P is not the case, because if P were the case, Q would have to be the case as well, given the first premise.\n\nGiven that the argument in question follows the form of Modus Tollens, and Modus Tollens is a logically valid form of argument, the argument about the car and the truck is also logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
