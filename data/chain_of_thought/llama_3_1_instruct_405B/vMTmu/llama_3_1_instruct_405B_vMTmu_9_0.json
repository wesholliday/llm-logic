            "content": "Explanation: To determine the logical validity of the argument, we need to examine its form. The argument can be represented symbolically as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q (If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt)\n2. Not Q (It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt)\n3. Therefore, Not P (Lisa did not buy the red shirt)\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. Modus Tollens states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not Q\", we can logically conclude \"Not P\". The validity of Modus Tollens can be understood through the following reasoning: if the truth of P implies the truth of Q, and we know Q is not true, then P cannot be true because if it were, Q would have to be true as well, which contradicts our second premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
