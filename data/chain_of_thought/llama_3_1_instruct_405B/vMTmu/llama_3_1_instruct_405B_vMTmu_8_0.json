            "content": "Explanation: To determine the logical validity of the argument, let's break it down into its components and analyze the structure. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\" This can be represented as \"V \u2192 M\", where V stands for \"the vampire was awake\" and M stands for \"the mummy must have been awake\". The second premise is the negation of the consequent of the first premise, which is \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake\", represented as \"\u00acM\". The conclusion drawn is \"The vampire was not awake\", represented as \"\u00acV\".\n\nThe argument form can thus be represented as:\n1. V \u2192 M\n2. \u00acM\n\u2234 \u00acV\n\nThis form is a classic example of Modus Tollens, a logically valid argument form in propositional logic. Modus Tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (if-then) and we know the consequent (the \"then\" part) is false, we can conclude that the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is also false.\n\nGiven the premises and the conclusion follow the structure of Modus Tollens, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
