            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument can be represented in a symbolic form as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q (If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis)\n2. Not Q (It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis)\n3. Therefore, Not P (Jeff did not play basketball)\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. Modus Tollens states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not Q\", we can logically conclude \"Not P\". The reasoning is that if the consequent (Q) of the conditional statement is false, and the conditional statement itself is true, then the antecedent (P) must also be false, because if P were true, Q would have to be true as well, according to the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, given the premises that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis, and it's not the case that Amy must have played tennis, we can logically conclude that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
