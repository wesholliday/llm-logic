            "content": "Explanation: To determine the logical validity of the argument, we need to examine its form. The argument can be represented symbolically as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q (If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow)\n2. Not Q (It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow)\n3. Therefore, Not P (The apple was not red)\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. Modus Tollens states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not Q\", we can logically conclude \"Not P\". The validity of this form is based on the principle that if the consequent (Q) of a conditional statement is false, and the conditional statement itself is true, then the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\nGiven that the argument follows the Modus Tollens form, which is a recognized valid form of argument, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
