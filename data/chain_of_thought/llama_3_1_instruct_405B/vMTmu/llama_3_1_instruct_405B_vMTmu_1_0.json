            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument can be symbolized as follows:\n\n1. If M, then S (If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding)\n2. Not necessarily S (It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding)\n3. \u2234 Not M (Mary was not at the wedding)\n\nThe first premise establishes a conditional relationship between Mary's and Sue's presence at the wedding. The second premise states that it's not necessary for Sue to have been at the wedding, which can be interpreted as saying that Sue's presence is not a given or guaranteed. \n\nHowever, the conclusion that Mary was not at the wedding does not logically follow from these premises. The first premise only sets up a condition where if Mary is present, then Sue must be present. The second premise does not negate the possibility of Sue being at the wedding; it merely states that her presence is not a necessity. Therefore, it does not directly impact the condition set by the first premise regarding Mary's and Sue's presence. \n\nFor the argument to be logically valid, the second premise would need to assert that Sue was definitely not at the wedding, not just that her presence was not necessary. As it stands, the argument's form does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion based on the premises provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
