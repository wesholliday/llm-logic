            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Sue was not at the wedding' from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is 'Mary was not at the wedding'. This is a straightforward statement about Mary's absence.\n\n2. The second statement is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding'. This is a conditional statement that connects Mary's presence at the wedding to Sue's presence. It implies that if Mary was there, then Sue must have been there as well. However, it does not make any direct claim about Sue's presence or absence if Mary was not there.\n\n3. From the first statement, we know Mary was not at the wedding. The conditional statement (if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding) does not provide information about Sue's presence or absence in the scenario where Mary is not at the wedding. It only specifies what would be the case if Mary were there.\n\n4. Since the conditional statement is only applicable when its antecedent (Mary was at the wedding) is true, and we know that antecedent is false (Mary was not at the wedding), we cannot use this conditional to infer anything about Sue's presence or absence directly.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot logically infer 'Sue was not at the wedding' from the given statements because the conditional statement about Sue's presence is contingent on Mary's presence, which we know did not occur.\n\nAnswer: no",
