            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The pants were not denim' from the given statements, let's analyze the information step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is 'The shirt was not cotton'. This gives us information about the material of the shirt but does not directly tell us anything about the pants.\n\n2. The second statement is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'. This is a conditional statement that connects the material of the shirt (cotton) to the material of the pants (denim), but it only applies if the shirt is indeed cotton.\n\n3. Since we know from the first statement that the shirt was not cotton, the condition in the second statement is not met. Therefore, we cannot use the second statement to conclude anything about the material of the pants because its premise (the shirt being cotton) is false.\n\n4. In logic, when the premise of a conditional statement is false, the conclusion does not necessarily follow. This means we cannot infer that the pants were not denim based solely on these two statements. The material of the pants remains unknown.\n\nAnswer: no",
