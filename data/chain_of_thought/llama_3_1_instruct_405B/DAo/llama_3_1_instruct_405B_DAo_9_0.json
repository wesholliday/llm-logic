            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the information given. The first statement is \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" This is a straightforward statement about Lisa's action (or lack thereof). The second statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement that connects Lisa's potential action (buying the red shirt) to Mark's action (buying the blue shirt), but it only comes into effect if Lisa actually bought the red shirt.\n\nGiven that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, the condition for the second statement is not met. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusion about Mark's action based on the conditional statement because its premise (Lisa buying the red shirt) is false. The conditional statement does not provide any information about what happens if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, which is the actual scenario we are dealing with.\n\nIn logic, from a false premise, we cannot infer anything about the truth of the conclusion in a conditional statement. The conclusion (Mark bought the blue shirt) is dependent on the premise being true, which it is not in this case. Therefore, we cannot infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt based on the information given. Mark's action remains undetermined by the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
