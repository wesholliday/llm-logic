            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The banana was not yellow' from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is 'The apple was not red'. This statement gives us information about the color of the apple but does not directly tell us anything about the banana.\n\n2. The second statement is 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'. This is a conditional statement that connects the color of the apple to the color of the banana under a specific condition (the apple being red).\n\n3. Since the apple was not red, according to the first statement, the condition in the second statement is not met. Therefore, we cannot conclude anything about the color of the banana based on the conditional statement because its premise (the apple being red) is false.\n\n4. In logic, from a false premise, we cannot infer the truth of the consequent (in this case, the banana being yellow or not). The conditional statement only tells us what would be true if the apple was red, but since it's not, we cannot use this statement to conclude the banana's color.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The banana was not yellow' from the given statements because the condition that would allow us to make a conclusion about the banana's color is not met.\n\nAnswer: no",
