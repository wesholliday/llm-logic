            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument's form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. Either P or Q (Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden)\n2. Not Q (Fido is not in the garden)\n3. Therefore, P (Fido is inside)\n\nThis form of argument is known as a disjunctive syllogism. In a disjunctive syllogism, if one of the disjuncts (the options presented in the \"either...or\" premise) is negated, the other disjunct must be true because the initial premise asserts that at least one of the disjuncts is true. Therefore, given that the premises assert that Fido must be either inside or in the garden and that he is not in the garden, logically, Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
