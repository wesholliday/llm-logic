The argument's form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. Either P or Q (where P = \"the toy is in the toy box\" and Q = \"it is sitting on the shelf\")\n2. Not Q\n3. Therefore, P\n\nThis form of argument is known as a disjunctive syllogism. In a disjunctive syllogism, if one of the disjuncts (the options presented in the \"either...or\" statement) is negated, the other disjunct must be true because the original statement presents these options as the only possibilities. \n\nGiven that the premises assert \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf\" and then inform us that \"The toy isn't sitting on the shelf,\" logically, the only remaining possibility is that the toy is in the toy box. This conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, making the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
