            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument's form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. Either P or Q (where P = \"the book is on the shelf\" and Q = \"it is resting on the table\")\n2. Not Q\n3. Therefore, P\n\nThis form of argument is known as a disjunctive syllogism. In a disjunctive syllogism, if one of the disjuncts (the options presented in the \"either...or\" statement) is negated, the other disjunct must be true because the original statement presents these options as the only possibilities. \n\nGiven that the first premise presents only two possibilities for the book's location and the second premise eliminates one of those possibilities, the conclusion logically follows that the book must be in the remaining location. This is because the structure of the argument ensures that if one disjunct is false, the other must be true, given that at least one of them must be true according to the first premise.\n\nTherefore, the form of the argument is logically valid because it correctly applies the principle of disjunctive syllogism.\n\nAnswer: yes",
