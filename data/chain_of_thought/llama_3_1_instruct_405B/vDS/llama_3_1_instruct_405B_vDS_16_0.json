            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument's form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. Either A or B (where A = \"the pen is in my bag\" and B = \"the pen is on my desk\")\n2. Not B\n3. Therefore, A\n\nThis form of argument is known as a disjunctive syllogism. In a disjunctive syllogism, if one of the disjuncts (options) is eliminated, the other disjunct must be true. Here, the first premise presents two possibilities for the pen's location, and the second premise eliminates one of those possibilities. Given that the pen can only be in one of the two locations according to the first premise, eliminating one location logically necessitates that the pen is in the other location.\n\nTherefore, based on the rules of logic, specifically the rule governing disjunctive syllogisms, if we accept the premises as true, we must accept the conclusion as true as well. This indicates that the argument's form is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
