            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, let's break down the logic. The original statement is \"If the snark was blimmed, then it flooped.\" This is a conditional statement where \"the snark was blimmed\" is the condition (or antecedent) and \"it flooped\" is the consequence (or consequent). The statement implies that being blimmed is sufficient for the snark to floop.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement: \"If the snark was blimmed and sproinged, then it flooped.\" This statement adds an additional condition to the original one; now, the snark not only needs to be blimmed but also sproinged for the consequence (it flooped) to occur.\n\nFrom a logical standpoint, if being blimmed alone is sufficient for the snark to floop (as per the first statement), then adding another condition (being sproinged) does not negate the original condition's sufficiency for the consequence. In other words, if being blimmed is enough for the snark to floop, then being both blimmed and sproinged will also lead to the snark flooping, because the condition of being blimmed, which we know is sufficient for flooping, is still met.\n\nTherefore, logically, we can infer the second statement from the first because adding more conditions to a sufficient condition does not negate the sufficiency of the original condition for the consequence to occur.\n\nAnswer: yes",
