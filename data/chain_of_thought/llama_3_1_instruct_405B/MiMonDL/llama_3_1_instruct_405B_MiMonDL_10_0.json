            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The computer might be broken or working' from 'The computer might be broken', we need to analyze the logical relationship between these two statements. 'The computer might be broken' implies a possibility of the computer being in a non-functional state, but it does not explicitly rule out the possibility of it working. In fact, the word 'might' inherently suggests uncertainty, leaving room for the alternative condition (the computer working) to be true. Therefore, if the computer might be broken, it logically follows that it might also be working, as these are complementary states within the scope of 'might'. Thus, we can infer 'The computer might be broken or working' from the original statement because it simply acknowledges both possibilities without asserting a definitive state.\n\nAnswer: yes",
