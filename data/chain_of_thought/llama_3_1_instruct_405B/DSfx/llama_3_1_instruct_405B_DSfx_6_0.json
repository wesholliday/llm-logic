            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the information given into logical steps. The first statement is \"Either the grommet is plopped or it is sploffed.\" This is a classic example of an \"or\" statement in logic, which means that at least one of the conditions must be true. There are two possibilities here: the grommet is plopped, or the grommet is sploffed. The second statement is \"The grommet is not plopped.\" This statement directly negates one of the two possibilities presented in the first statement.\n\nGiven that one of the two conditions must be true (plopped or sploffed) and knowing that the grommet is not plopped, we can logically conclude that the remaining condition must be true. This is because in an \"or\" statement, if one option is proven false, the other must be true for the original statement to hold.\n\nTherefore, if the grommet is not plopped, and it must be either plopped or sploffed, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
