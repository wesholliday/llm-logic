            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements and apply basic logical rules. The first statement is \"Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked.\" This is an 'or' statement, meaning at least one of the conditions must be true for the whole statement to be true. The second statement is \"The sprocket is not daggled.\" This directly negates one part of the 'or' statement.\n\nGiven the structure of the 'or' statement (A or B), if we know A is false, we can infer B must be true because the statement requires at least one of the conditions to be true. Therefore, if \"The sprocket is not daggled\" (A is false), then for the 'or' statement to hold true, \"The sprocket is cranked\" (B) must be true.\n\nThis is a basic application of the disjunctive syllogism, a rule of inference in logic that states if A or B is true, and A is false, then B must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
