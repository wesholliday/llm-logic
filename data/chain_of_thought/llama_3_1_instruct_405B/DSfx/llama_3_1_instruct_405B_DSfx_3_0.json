            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the given statements and apply basic logical reasoning. The first statement is \"Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed.\" This is a classic example of an \"or\" statement in logic, which means at least one of the conditions must be true. The second statement is \"The splat is not quanked.\" Given this information, we can determine the truth of the first statement's components. Since we know the splat is not quanked, the only way the \"or\" statement can be true is if the splat is morphed. This is because in an \"or\" statement, if one option is proven false, the other must be true for the entire statement to hold true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
