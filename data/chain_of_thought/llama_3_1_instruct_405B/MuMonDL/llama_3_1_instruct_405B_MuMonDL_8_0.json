            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays or had limited hours' from 'The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. The original statement asserts that the restaurant was definitely closed on Mondays. The inferred statement offers two possibilities: the restaurant was either closed on Mondays or had limited hours. Since being closed is one of the options in the inferred statement and it directly aligns with the original statement, we can logically infer the second statement from the first. The inferred statement is less specific and includes the original condition (being closed) as one of its options, making it a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
