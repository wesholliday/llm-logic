            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The flight must have been delayed or rescheduled' from 'The flight must have been delayed', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements. The original statement 'The flight must have been delayed' asserts a necessity about a specific condition (delay) of the flight. The inferred statement 'The flight must have been delayed or rescheduled' introduces an additional condition (rescheduled) with an 'or', which logically includes the original condition (delayed). Since 'delayed' is a subset of 'delayed or rescheduled', if the flight must have been delayed, then it logically follows that the flight must have been either delayed or rescheduled, because 'delayed' satisfies one of the conditions in the 'or' statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
