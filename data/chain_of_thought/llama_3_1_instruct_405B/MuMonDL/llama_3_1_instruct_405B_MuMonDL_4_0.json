            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The meeting must have been scheduled for 2 PM or been rescheduled' from 'The meeting must have been scheduled for 2 PM', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements. The original statement asserts a necessity about the past - that the meeting must have been scheduled for 2 PM. This statement does not explicitly mention the possibility of rescheduling, but it does assert that at some point in the past, the meeting was indeed scheduled for 2 PM.\n\nThe inferred statement adds an additional condition - 'or been rescheduled'. This condition introduces an alternative scenario that isn't directly addressed by the original statement. However, if the meeting must have been scheduled for 2 PM, then it logically follows that it either remained scheduled for 2 PM or could have been rescheduled afterward. The act of rescheduling does not negate the fact that it was initially scheduled for 2 PM.\n\nTherefore, the inferred statement is a logical consequence of the original statement because it includes the original condition (scheduled for 2 PM) and adds a possible subsequent action (been rescheduled), which does not contradict the original assertion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
