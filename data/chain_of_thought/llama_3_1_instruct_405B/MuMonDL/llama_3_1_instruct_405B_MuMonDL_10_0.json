            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The document must have been signed or approved' from 'The document must have been signed', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements. The original statement 'The document must have been signed' asserts a necessity - it must be signed. The inferred statement 'The document must have been signed or approved' introduces an alternative condition (approved) in addition to being signed, making it less restrictive than the original statement. Since being signed is a subset of being signed or approved, if the document must have been signed, then it logically follows that it must have been signed or approved, because being signed satisfies the 'or' condition.\n\nAnswer: yes",
