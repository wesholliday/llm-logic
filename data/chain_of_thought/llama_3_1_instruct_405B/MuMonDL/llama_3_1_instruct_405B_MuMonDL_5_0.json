            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The package must have been delivered today or tomorrow' from 'The package must have been delivered today', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements. The original statement 'The package must have been delivered today' asserts a specific time frame for the delivery, which is today. The inferred statement 'The package must have been delivered today or tomorrow' expands this time frame to include tomorrow as a possibility.\n\nHowever, if the package must have been delivered today, then it logically follows that it also must have been delivered today or tomorrow, because 'today' is included in the options 'today or tomorrow'. This is a basic principle of logic where if a specific condition is true, then a more general condition that includes the specific condition is also true.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer 'The package must have been delivered today or tomorrow' from 'The package must have been delivered today', as the latter is a subset of the former in terms of possible delivery times.\n\nAnswer: yes",
