            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The event must have been formal or black-tie' from 'The event must have been formal', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. 'The event must have been formal' is a definitive statement that specifies the nature of the event as being formal. 'The event must have been formal or black-tie' introduces an alternative by including 'black-tie', which is generally considered to be a more specific and higher level of formality than just 'formal'. \n\nSince 'formal' is already specified in the original statement and 'black-tie' is a subset or a more specific instance of 'formal', adding 'black-tie' as an option does not contradict the original statement but rather offers an additional, more detailed possibility that still aligns with the event being formal. Therefore, if the event must have been formal, it inherently includes the possibility of it also being black-tie, as black-tie events are a type of formal event.\n\nAnswer: yes",
