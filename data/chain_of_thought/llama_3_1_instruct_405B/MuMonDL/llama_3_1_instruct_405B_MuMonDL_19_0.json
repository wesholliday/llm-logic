            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The application must have been completed online or submitted electronically' from 'The application must have been completed online', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. The original statement specifies that the application must have been completed online, which implies the use of the internet for the completion process. The inferred statement adds an alternative method of submission - 'submitted electronically', which can encompass online completion but also includes other electronic means that might not necessarily be online (e.g., through a dedicated electronic terminal or device not connected to the internet).\n\nHowever, since 'completed online' inherently means the application was submitted electronically (as completing something online involves electronic submission), the inferred statement essentially offers a broader or equivalent condition ('submitted electronically') in addition to the original condition ('completed online'). Therefore, if an application must have been completed online, it inherently fulfills the condition of being submitted electronically, making the inferred statement true based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
