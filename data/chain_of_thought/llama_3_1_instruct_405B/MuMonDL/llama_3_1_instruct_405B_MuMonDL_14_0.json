            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The contract must have been valid for a year or longer' from 'The contract must have been valid for a year', we need to analyze the meaning and implications of both statements. The original statement specifies a minimum duration of one year for the contract's validity. It does not explicitly exclude the possibility of the contract being valid for more than a year. Therefore, if a contract has been valid for a year, it inherently meets the condition of being valid for a year or longer, as \"or longer\" is an optional extension beyond the minimum requirement of one year. This means the inference is logically sound because being valid for a year does not preclude the contract from being valid for a longer period.\n\nAnswer: yes",
