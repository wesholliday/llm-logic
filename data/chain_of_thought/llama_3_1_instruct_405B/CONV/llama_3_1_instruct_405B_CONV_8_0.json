            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" implies a one-way relationship where the wakefulness of the vampire guarantees the wakefulness of the mummy. However, it does not necessarily imply the reverse: that if the mummy was awake, the vampire must also have been awake. The original statement only guarantees that the vampire's wakefulness is a sufficient condition for the mummy's wakefulness, but it does not make it a necessary condition. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the reverse statement based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
