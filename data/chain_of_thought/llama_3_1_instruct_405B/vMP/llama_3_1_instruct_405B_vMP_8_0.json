            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument is structured as follows:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. (If P, then Q)\n2. The vampire was awake. (P)\n3. Therefore, the mummy was awake. (Therefore, Q)\n\nThis argument follows the modus ponens form, which is a logically valid form of argument. Modus ponens is structured as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. P\n3. Therefore, Q\n\nIn modus ponens, if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, the argument about the vampire and the mummy follows a logically valid form because if the premises (the vampire being awake implies the mummy is awake, and the vampire is indeed awake) are true, the conclusion (the mummy is awake) necessarily follows.\n\nAnswer: yes",
