            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument is structured as follows:\n\n1. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. (If P, then Q)\n2. Sue chose pizza. (P)\n3. Therefore, Bob chose pasta. (Therefore, Q)\n\nThis argument form is known as modus ponens, which is a logically valid form of argument. Modus ponens states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"P\", we can logically conclude \"Q\". In this case, P represents \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q represents \"Bob chose pasta\". Given that the first premise establishes a conditional relationship between Sue's choice and Bob's choice, and the second premise asserts that the condition (Sue choosing pizza) is true, the conclusion that Bob chose pasta logically follows.\n\nAnswer: yes",
