            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument's form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. P\n3. Therefore, Q\n\nIn this representation, P stands for \"Tom watched football\" and Q stands for \"Jen watched basketball\". This form of argument is known as modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. The rule of modus ponens states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and we also have P, we can logically conclude Q. Therefore, given that the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true, making the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
