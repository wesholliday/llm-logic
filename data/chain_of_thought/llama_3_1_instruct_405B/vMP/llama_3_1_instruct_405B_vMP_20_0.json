The argument is structured as follows:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. (If A, then B)\n2. The apple was red. (A)\n3. Therefore, the banana was yellow. (Therefore, B)\n\nThis argument follows the modus ponens form, which is a logically valid form of argument. Modus ponens is structured as follows:\n\n1. If A, then B\n2. A\n3. Therefore, B\n\nIn modus ponens, if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. The conclusion logically and necessarily follows from the premises. Therefore, the argument about the apple and the banana follows a logically valid form.\n\nAnswer: yes",
