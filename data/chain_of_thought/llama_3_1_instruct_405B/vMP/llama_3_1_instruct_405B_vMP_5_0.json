The argument has the form:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. P\n3. Therefore, Q\n\nThis is a classic example of modus ponens, a valid form of argument in logic. The first premise sets up a conditional relationship between P (Jeff played basketball) and Q (Amy played tennis), stating that if P is true, then Q must also be true. The second premise asserts that P is indeed true (Jeff played basketball). Given these premises, the conclusion that Q is true (Amy played tennis) logically and necessarily follows.\n\nAnswer: yes",
