            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument is structured as follows:\n\n1. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. (If A, then B)\n2. The shirt was cotton. (A)\n3. Therefore, the pants were denim. (Therefore, B)\n\nThis argument form is known as modus ponens, which is a logically valid form of argument. Modus ponens states that if we have \"If A, then B\" and \"A\", we can logically conclude \"B\". The structure of the argument ensures that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, regardless of the specific content (cotton shirts and denim pants), the form of the argument itself is what makes it logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
