            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument is structured as follows:\n\n1. If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. (If P, then Q)\n2. The doll was plastic. (P)\n3. Therefore, the truck was metal. (Therefore, Q)\n\nThis argument form is known as modus ponens, which is a logically valid form of argument. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (if P, then Q) and we know that the antecedent (P) is true, we can logically conclude that the consequent (Q) is also true. Since the argument follows this form, and given the premises, the conclusion must necessarily follow, making the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
