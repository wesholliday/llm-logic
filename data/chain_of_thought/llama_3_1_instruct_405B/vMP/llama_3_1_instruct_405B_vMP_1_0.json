            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument's form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. P\n\u2234 Q\n\nWhere P represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q represents \"Sue was at the wedding\".\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. The rule of modus ponens states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and we also have P, we can logically conclude Q.\n\nTherefore, given the premises that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding, and knowing that Mary was indeed at the wedding, we can logically conclude that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
