            "content": "Explanation: To solve this, let's break down the information given into logical statements. The first statement is \"The shank is not nugged,\" which we can denote as \u00acN (where N represents \"The shank is nugged\" and \u00ac denotes negation). The second statement is \"Either the shank is nugged or it is plooked,\" which we can denote as N \u2228 P (where \u2228 represents \"or\" and P represents \"The shank is plooked\").\n\nGiven these two statements, we can apply a logical rule known as disjunctive syllogism. Disjunctive syllogism states that if we have \u00acA and A \u2228 B, we can infer B. Applying this rule to our statements, since we have \u00acN (The shank is not nugged) and N \u2228 P (Either the shank is nugged or it is plooked), we can infer P (The shank is plooked).\n\nAnswer: yes",
