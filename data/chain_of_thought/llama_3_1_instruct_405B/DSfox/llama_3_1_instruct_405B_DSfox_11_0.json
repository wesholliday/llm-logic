The first statement says, \"The flug is not zimmed.\" This directly negates the possibility of the flug being zimmed. The second statement presents two possibilities with an \"either-or\" condition: \"Either the flug is zimmed or it is blummed.\" Since we already know from the first statement that the flug is not zimmed, the option of it being zimmed is eliminated. In an \"either-or\" scenario, when one option is proven false, the other option is inferred to be true, assuming these are the only two possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes",
