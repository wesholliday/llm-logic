It does not mention anything about the submission time of the report. Therefore, we cannot infer any information about the submission time based on this statement alone.\n\nIn order to infer 'The report must have been accurate and been submitted by noon', we would need additional information that specifies the submission time as being by noon. Since this information is not provided in the original statement, the inference cannot be made.\n\nAnswer: no",
