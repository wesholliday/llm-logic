The original statement only mentions the difficulty of the exam, without providing any details about its content or scope. Inferring that the exam covered all chapters would be adding information not present in the original statement. Inference requires that the conclusion logically follows from the premises, but in this case, the conclusion about covering all chapters does not logically follow from the premise about the exam's difficulty.\n\nAnswer: no",
