The original statement only mentions that the document must have been signed, without providing any information about notarization. Notarization is an additional step that may or may not be required, depending on the context and the specific requirements of the document in question. Since the original statement does not mention notarization, we cannot assume that it is a necessary condition.\n\nAnswer: no",
