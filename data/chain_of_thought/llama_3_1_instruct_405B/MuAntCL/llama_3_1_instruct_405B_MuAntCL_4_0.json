The original statement only mentions the time of the meeting, which is 2 PM. It does not provide any information about the location of the meeting. The inferred statement adds a new piece of information, which is that the meeting was in the conference room. Since the original statement does not mention the location, we cannot logically infer the location from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
