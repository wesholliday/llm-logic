It does not confirm that the smip is not lupped, but it leaves open the possibility.\n\n2. \"Either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped\" presents two alternatives: the smip being lupped is a necessity, or the smip is shripped. This statement implies that if the smip is not lupped (which is a possibility from the first statement), then it must be shripped, as these are presented as the only two options.\n\nGiven these statements, if we consider the possibility that the smip is not lupped (as suggested by the first statement), the second statement directs us to the conclusion that if it's not lupped, then it must be shripped.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the logical connection between the statements, we can infer that if the smip is not lupped, it is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
