The dreb might not be spened.\n\nTo infer that the dreb is vroombed, we need to use the information in a logical way. Here's one possible way to do so:\n\n1. If the dreb is not vroombed, then it must be spened. (This is the first given information.)\n2. The dreb might not be spened. (This is the second given information.)\n3. Therefore, the dreb is vroombed. (This is the conclusion we can draw from the information given.)\n\nAnswer: Yes",
