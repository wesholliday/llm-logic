The grommet might not be plopped.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the grommet is sploffed, we need to analyze the logical relationships between the statements.\n\nThe first statement implies that the grommet is either sploffed or plopped. If the grommet is plopped, then it is not sploffed. Therefore, the first statement implies that the grommet is either sploffed or not plopped.\n\nThe second statement states that the grommet might not be plopped. This means that the grommet is not plopped, or it might be plopped.\n\nNow, we can combine the two statements to determine whether we can infer that the grommet is sploffed. If the grommet is not plopped, then it must be sploffed. Therefore, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
