The splat might not be quanked.\n\nTo infer that the splat is morphed, we need to analyze the given information and determine whether it is possible to conclude that the splat is morphed based on the information provided.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first statement: \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked.\" This statement suggests that the splat is either morphed or it must be quanked. However, it does not provide any information about whether the splat is actually morphed or not.\n\nNext, let's consider the second statement: \"The splat might not be quanked.\" This statement suggests that the splat might not be quanked, but it does not provide any information about whether the splat is actually morphed or not.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information provided:\n\n1. The first statement suggests that the splat is either morphed or it must be quanked.\n2. The second statement suggests that the splat might not be quanked.\n\nBased on the information provided, it is not possible to conclude that the splat is morphed. The first statement does not provide any information about whether the splat is actually morphed or not, and the second statement only suggests that the splat might not be quanked. Therefore, the inference that the splat is morphed cannot be made based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
