The flug might not be zimmed.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'The flug is blummed' from the given information, we need to analyze the logical relationships between the statements.\n\nThe first statement implies that the flug is either blummed or zimmed. If the flug is zimmed, then it is not blummed, and vice versa. Therefore, the first statement is logically equivalent to 'The flug is either blummed or zimmed, but not both.'\n\nThe second statement implies that the flug might not be zimmed. This means that the flug is either blummed or not zimmed.\n\nNow, we can combine the two statements to get:\n\nThe flug is either blummed or zimmed, but not both.\nThe flug might not be zimmed.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the flug is blummed. This is because the first statement implies that the flug is either blummed or zimmed, but not both, and the second statement implies that the flug is not zimmed. Therefore, the flug must be blummed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
