This implies that the flugel cannot be both blimmed and zargled at the same time.\n\nThe second statement, \"The flugel might not be zargled,\" suggests that the flugel is not necessarily zargled. This implies that the flugel could be either blimmed or not zargled.\n\nBased on these two statements, we cannot infer that the flugel is blimmed. The flugel could be either blimmed or not zargled, and we do not have enough information to determine which is the case.\n\nAnswer: No",
