            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The fribble might be on the blurble', let's break down the given statement. The original statement is 'The fribble might be on the blurble or in the wobble'. This statement uses the word 'or', which is a disjunction operator. It indicates that the fribble could either be on the blurble or in the wobble, but not necessarily both. The word 'or' suggests an exclusive disjunction, meaning that the fribble can only be in one of the two locations, not both. Therefore, we can infer that the fribble might be on the blurble, but we cannot infer that it might be in the wobble.\n\nAnswer: yes"
