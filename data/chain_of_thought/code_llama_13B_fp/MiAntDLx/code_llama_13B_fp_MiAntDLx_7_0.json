This type of statement is often represented as \"A or B\" or \"A \u2228 B\". In this case, the statement is saying that the blimp has a possibility of being quibble, but it's not ruling out the possibility of it being frozz. Therefore, we can infer that the blimp might indeed be quibble.\n\nAnswer: yes"
