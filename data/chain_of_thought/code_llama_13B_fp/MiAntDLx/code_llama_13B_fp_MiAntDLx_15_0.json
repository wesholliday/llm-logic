The phrase \"The wozzle might be\" is a conditional statement that suggests a possibility. The words that follow, \"zooble flonk blimp or zibber\", are presented as alternatives to \"wozzle\". The use of \"or\" indicates that these words are mutually exclusive possibilities. Since \"zooble flonk blimp\" is one of the alternatives, it is reasonable to infer that \"The wozzle might be zooble flonk blimp\" is a possible statement based on the original sentence.\n\nAnswer: yes"
