The second statement, 'Either the clug is fleeked or it is snugged,' suggests that the clug is either in a fleeked position or a snugged position.\n\nIf we assume that the clug is not snugged, then it must be in a fleeked position. Therefore, we can infer that 'The clug is fleeked' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
