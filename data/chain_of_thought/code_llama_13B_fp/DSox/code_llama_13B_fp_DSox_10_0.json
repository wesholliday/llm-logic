The second premise, 'Either the wug is sproinged or it is garpled', tells us that the wug is either in a state of being sproinged or it is in a state of being garpled.\n\nIf we assume that the wug is not garpled, then it must be in a state of being sproinged. Therefore, we can infer that 'The wug is sproinged' from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
