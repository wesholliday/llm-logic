This means that we can infer 'The flug is blummed' if we know that 'The flug is not zimmed' and 'Either the flug is blummed or it is zimmed' are both true.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer 'The flug is blummed' if we only know that 'The flug is not zimmed' is true. This is because 'The flug is not zimmed' does not necessarily imply that 'The flug is blummed'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'no'. We cannot infer 'The flug is blummed' from 'The flug is not zimmed' together with 'Either the flug is blummed or it is zimmed'.",
