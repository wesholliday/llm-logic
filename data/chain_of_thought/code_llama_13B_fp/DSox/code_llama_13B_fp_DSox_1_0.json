Either the flugel is blimmed or it is zargled.\n\nTo infer that the flugel is blimmed, we need to apply the principle of excluded middle, which states that for any proposition, either it is true or it is false. In this case, we can infer that the flugel is blimmed because it is not zargled, and the only other option is that it is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
