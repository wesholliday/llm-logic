Either the sprocket is cranked or it is daggled.\n\nTo infer that the sprocket is cranked, we need to use the information in the premises to reach a conclusion. In this case, we can use the second premise to deduce that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nThe second premise states that either the sprocket is cranked or it is daggled. Since we know that the sprocket is not daggled, we can conclude that it must be cranked.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes.",
