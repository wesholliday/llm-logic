The statement \"The fleeg is not surned\" implies that the fleeg is not burnt, while the statement \"Either the fleeg is bluttered or it is surned\" implies that the fleeg is either burnt or not burnt.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the fleeg is not burnt (i.e., it is not surned), then it cannot be both not burnt and burnt at the same time. This creates a logical contradiction, which means that the given information is not sufficient to determine whether the fleeg is burnt or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the fleeg is burnt based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
