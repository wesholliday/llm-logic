Either the glip is slogged or it is tragged.\n\nTo infer that the glip is slogged, we need to use the information in a logical way. We can do this by using the principle of excluded middle, which states that for any proposition, either it is true or it is false.\n\nUsing this principle, we can say that if the glip is not tragged, then it must be slogged. This is because if the glip is not tragged, then it cannot be tragged, and therefore it must be slogged.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
