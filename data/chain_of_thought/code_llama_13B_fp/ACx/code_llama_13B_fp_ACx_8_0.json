The sprocket was daggled.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'The sprocket was cranked' from these premises, we need to analyze the logical relationships between them.\n\nThe first premise states that if the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled. This means that if the sprocket was cranked, then it is necessarily true that the sprocket was daggled. In other words, the first premise states that the sprocket was daggled if and only if it was cranked.\n\nThe second premise simply states that the sprocket was daggled. This premise does not provide any information about whether the sprocket was cranked or not.\n\nNow, we can use the first premise to infer that the sprocket was cranked if we know that it was daggled. In other words, if we know that the sprocket was daggled, then we can conclude that it was cranked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The sprocket was cranked' from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
