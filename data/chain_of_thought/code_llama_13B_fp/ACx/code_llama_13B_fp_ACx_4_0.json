In this case, the first part of the statement is 'The fribble was snurgled', and the second part is 'The fribble crinked'.\n\n'The fribble crinked' is a separate statement that does not necessarily follow from the first statement. It could be true even if the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The fribble was snurgled' from 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked' together with 'The fribble crinked'.\n\nAnswer: no",
