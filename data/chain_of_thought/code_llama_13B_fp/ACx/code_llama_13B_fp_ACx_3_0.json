However, this statement is not necessarily true, as the word \"morphed\" can have multiple meanings, and it is not clear what the speaker means by \"morphed\" in this context.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The splat was morphed\" is true based on the statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" and the additional information \"The splat quanked\".\n\nAnswer: no",
