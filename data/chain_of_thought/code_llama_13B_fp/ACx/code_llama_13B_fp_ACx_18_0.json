In this case, the antecedent is 'the shank was plooked', and the consequent is 'the shank was nugged'.\n\n'The shank was nugged' is a simple statement that asserts the truth of the proposition 'the shank was nugged'.\n\nTo infer 'The shank was plooked', we need to find a way to make the antecedent of the conditional statement true. In other words, we need to find a way to make 'the shank was plooked' true.\n\nHowever, there is no information in the given statements that would allow us to make 'the shank was plooked' true. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The shank was plooked' from 'If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged' together with 'The shank was nugged'.\n\nAnswer: no",
