The statement \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed\" is a logical contradiction, as it implies that if the flug was blummed, then it was also zimmed. However, the statement \"The flug was zimmed\" contradicts this, as it implies that the flug was not blummed. Therefore, we cannot infer that the flug was blummed from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
