However, without more context or information, it is not possible to determine the relationship between the two sentences.\n\nThe first sentence, \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink,\" is a conditional statement that suggests a causal relationship between the two events. However, the second sentence, \"The grommet plopped the frink,\" does not provide any additional information about the relationship between the two events.\n\nTherefore, without more context or information, it is not possible to infer that \"The grommet was sploffed\" from the two sentences.\n\nAnswer: No",
