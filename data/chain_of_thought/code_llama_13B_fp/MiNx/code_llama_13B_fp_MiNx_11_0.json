To infer that \"It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed,\" we need to negate the original statement.\n\nTo negate the statement, we can use the logical operator \"not\" to indicate that the possibility of the flug being blummed is not true. Therefore, the negated statement would be \"It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
