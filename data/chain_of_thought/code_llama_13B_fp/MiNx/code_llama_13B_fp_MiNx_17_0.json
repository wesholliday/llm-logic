To infer that \"It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled,\" we need to negate the original statement.\n\nTo negate the statement, we can use the logical operator \"not\" to indicate that the possibility of the flob being skizzled is not certain. Therefore, the negated statement would be \"It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
