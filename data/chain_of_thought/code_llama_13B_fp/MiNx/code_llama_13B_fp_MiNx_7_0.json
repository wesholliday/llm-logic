To infer that \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked,\" we would need to negate the original statement.\n\nTo negate the statement, we can use the logical operator \"not\" to indicate that the opposite is true. In this case, we can say \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked\" to indicate that it is not the case that the whiffle was shanked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
