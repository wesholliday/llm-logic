However, this statement does not necessarily imply that the fleeg must not have been bluttered.\n\nIn order to infer that \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered,\" we would need more information about the context in which the statement was made. For example, if the speaker was discussing a hypothetical scenario in which the fleeg was not bluttered, then we could infer that the fleeg must not have been bluttered. However, if the speaker was discussing a real-world scenario in which the fleeg was bluttered, then we could not necessarily infer that the fleeg must not have been bluttered.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is \"No.\" We cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered\" based solely on the statement \"The fleeg might not have been bluttered.\"",
