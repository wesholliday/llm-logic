The first statement says that either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed. The second statement says that the missing sock might not be under the bed.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the missing sock could be in the laundry basket or it could be under the bed. However, the second statement also implies that the missing sock is not under the bed, which means that it must be in the laundry basket. Therefore, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
