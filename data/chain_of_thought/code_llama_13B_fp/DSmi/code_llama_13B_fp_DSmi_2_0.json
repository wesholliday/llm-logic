The book might not be resting on the table.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the book is on the shelf, we need to analyze the logical relationships between the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that the book is either on the shelf or resting on the table. This means that the book is either on the shelf or not on the shelf, and it is either resting on the table or not resting on the table.\n\nThe second premise states that the book might not be resting on the table. This means that the book is not resting on the table, but it does not necessarily mean that the book is on the shelf.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the book is on the shelf based on the given premises. The book might be on the shelf, but it might also be resting on the table.\n\nAnswer: No",
