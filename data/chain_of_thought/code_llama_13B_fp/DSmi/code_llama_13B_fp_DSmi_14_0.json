The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\n\nTo infer that the milk is on the counter, we need to use the information in a logical way. Here's one possible way to do so:\n\n1. If the milk is not on the counter, then it must be chilling in the fridge (given in the first statement).\n2. However, the second statement says that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that the milk is not chilling in the fridge (since it might not be).\n4. Therefore, the milk must be on the counter (since it is not chilling in the fridge).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
