The first statement implies that the pen is either in the bag or on the desk, while the second statement states that the pen is not on the desk. This creates a logical contradiction, as the first statement implies that the pen is on the desk, while the second statement states that it is not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the pen is in the bag from the given information. The information is contradictory, and we cannot draw any conclusions from it.\n\nAnswer: No",
