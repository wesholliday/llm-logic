It means that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. This statement does not provide any information about whether Sam took a plane or not.\n\nThe second statement, 'Erin took a train,' is a factual statement. It means that Erin took a train.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationships between the two statements. If we assume that the first statement is true, then we can conclude that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. However, this does not necessarily mean that Sam took a plane. The first statement only provides a condition for Erin's action, but it does not provide any information about Sam's action.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Sam took a plane' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
