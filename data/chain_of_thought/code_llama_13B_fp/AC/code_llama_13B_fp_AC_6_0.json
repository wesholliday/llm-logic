It means that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\nThe second statement, 'Bob chose pasta', is a fact. It means that Bob did in fact choose pasta.\n\nNow, we need to consider the logical relationship between these two statements. If we assume that the first statement is true, then we can conclude that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. However, we don't know for sure whether Sue chose pizza or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Sue chose pizza' from the given information. The answer is 'no'.",
