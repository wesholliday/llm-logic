This is a logical implication, as cotton and denim are two different materials that are commonly used for clothing.\n\nHowever, the question also states that the pants were denim, which means that the shirt was not cotton. This creates a contradiction, as we cannot infer that the shirt was cotton based on the information provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no, we cannot infer that the shirt was cotton based on the information provided.",
