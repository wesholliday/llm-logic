The first statement says that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. This means that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nThe second statement says that the muffins were blueberry. This means that the muffins were not blueberry if the cake was not chocolate.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can infer that the cake was chocolate. This is because the first statement implies that the cake was chocolate if the muffins were blueberry, and the second statement says that the muffins were blueberry. Therefore, we can conclude that the cake was chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
