            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'Mary was at the wedding' from the given premises, we need to examine the logical relationships between the statements.\n\nThe first premise, 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', is a conditional statement. It states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. This means that if we know that Sue was at the wedding, we cannot conclude that Mary was also at the wedding.\n\nThe second premise, 'Sue was at the wedding', is a simple statement that states that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nNow, we need to apply the rules of logic to determine whether we can infer 'Mary was at the wedding' from the given premises.\n\nThe rule of modus ponens states that if we know that a conditional statement is true, and we know that the consequent of the conditional statement is true, then we can infer that the antecedent of the conditional statement is true.\n\nIn this case, we know that the conditional statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is true, because we have been given that premise. We also know that the consequent of the conditional statement, 'Sue was at the wedding', is true, because we have been given that premise as well.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer that the antecedent of the conditional statement, 'Mary was at the wedding', is true, because we do not know whether Mary was at the wedding or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Mary was at the wedding' from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
