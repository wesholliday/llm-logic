If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nTo infer that the cake was not chocolate, we need to analyze the given information and determine whether it is logically consistent.\n\nFirst, let's consider the premise that the muffins might not have been blueberry. This means that the muffins could have been any other type of muffin, including chocolate.\n\nNext, let's consider the conclusion that the cake was not chocolate. This means that the cake was not chocolate, regardless of the type of muffins that were served.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given information and determine whether it is logically consistent. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry. However, the muffins might not have been blueberry, which means that the cake could have been chocolate and the muffins could have been any other type of muffin.\n\nTherefore, the given information is logically consistent, and we cannot infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: No",
