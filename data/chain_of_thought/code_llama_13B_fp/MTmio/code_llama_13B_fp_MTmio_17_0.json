If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\n\nTo infer that Ben did not eat pasta, we need to analyze the given information and determine whether it is logically consistent.\n\nFirst, let's consider the premise that Kate might not have eaten salad. This means that it is possible that Kate did not eat salad, but it does not necessarily mean that she did not eat salad.\n\nNext, let's consider the conclusion that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad. This means that if Ben ate pasta, then it is certain that Kate ate salad.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given information and determine whether it is logically consistent. If Ben ate pasta, then it is certain that Kate ate salad. However, we are also told that Kate might not have eaten salad. This means that it is possible that Kate did not eat salad, even if Ben ate pasta.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Ben did not eat pasta from the given information. The information is logically consistent, and it is possible that both Ben and Kate ate their respective dishes.\n\nAnswer: No",
