If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\n\nTo infer that the vampire was not awake, we need to analyze the given information and determine whether it is possible for the vampire to be awake while the mummy is not awake.\n\nIf the vampire is awake, then the mummy must be awake by the second statement. Therefore, if the mummy is not awake, then the vampire cannot be awake.\n\nHowever, the first statement does not rule out the possibility that the mummy is not awake. Therefore, we cannot infer that the vampire was not awake based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
