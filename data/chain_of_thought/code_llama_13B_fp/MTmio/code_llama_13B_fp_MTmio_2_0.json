If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\n\nTo infer that the griffin was not in the forest, we need to assume that the unicorn was not in the forest. However, the first premise states that the unicorn might not have been in the forest, which means that it is possible that the unicorn was in the forest. Therefore, we cannot infer that the griffin was not in the forest based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
