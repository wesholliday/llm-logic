If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n\nTo infer that Sam did not take a plane, we need to analyze the given information and determine whether it is logically consistent.\n\nFirst, let's consider the premise \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\" This statement implies that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. However, the given information also states that Erin might not have taken a train. This creates a contradiction, as the premise implies that Erin must have taken a train, but the given information states that she might not have taken a train.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Sam did not take a plane based on the given information. The information is logically inconsistent, and we cannot draw any conclusions from it.\n\nAnswer: No",
