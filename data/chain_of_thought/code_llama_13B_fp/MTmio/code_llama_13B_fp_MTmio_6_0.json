If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\nTo infer that Sue did not choose pizza, we need to analyze the given information and determine whether it is logically consistent.\n\nFirst, let's consider the premise that Bob might not have chosen pasta. This means that it is possible that Bob did not choose pasta, but it does not necessarily mean that he did choose pasta.\n\nNext, let's consider the conclusion that Sue did not choose pizza. This means that it is possible that Sue did not choose pizza, but it does not necessarily mean that she did choose pizza.\n\nNow, let's look at the second premise: If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. This means that if Sue chose pizza, then it is logically necessary that Bob chose pasta.\n\nHowever, the first premise states that Bob might not have chosen pasta. This means that it is possible that Bob did not choose pasta, even if Sue chose pizza.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Sue did not choose pizza from the given information. The information is logically consistent, and it is possible that both Sue and Bob chose their respective foods.\n\nAnswer: No",
