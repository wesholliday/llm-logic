If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\n\nTo infer 'The car was not red', we need to analyze the given information and determine whether it is logically consistent.\n\n1. The first statement, 'The truck might not have been blue', implies that the truck could have been any color, including blue.\n2. The second statement, 'If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue', implies that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. If the car is red, then the truck must be blue.\n2. The truck might not have been blue.\n\nFrom the above two statements, we can conclude that the car could have been red, and the truck could have been any color, including blue. Therefore, we cannot infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: No",
