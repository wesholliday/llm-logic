If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\n\nTo infer 'The dog was not inside', we need to analyze the given information and determine whether it is possible to draw the conclusion that the dog was not inside.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possibility that the dog was inside. If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, we can conclude that the dog was not inside.\n\nSecond, let's consider the possibility that the dog was outside. If the dog was outside, then the cat might have been outside, which contradicts the second statement. Therefore, we can conclude that the dog was not outside.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the dog was not inside or outside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
