            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given information is a classic example of a logical contradiction. The first statement, \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt,\" implies that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. However, the second statement, \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt,\" implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This creates a logical contradiction, as the first statement implies that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, while the second statement implies that Mark did buy the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt from the given information. The information is contradictory, and we cannot make any conclusions based on it.\n\nAnswer: No",
