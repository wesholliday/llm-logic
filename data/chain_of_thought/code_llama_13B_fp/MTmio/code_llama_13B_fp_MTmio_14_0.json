The statement \"The wolf might not have been in the den\" is not enough information to determine whether the bear was in the cave or not. The statement \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den\" is also not enough information to determine whether the bear was in the cave or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that the bear was not in the cave based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
