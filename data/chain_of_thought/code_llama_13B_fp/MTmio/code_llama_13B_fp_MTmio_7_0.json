If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\n\nTo infer that Alex did not finish the race, we need to analyze the given information and determine whether it is logically consistent.\n\nFirst, let's consider the premise \"Chris might not have finished the race.\" This statement does not provide any information about whether Chris actually finished the race or not. It simply states that Chris might not have finished the race, which means that there is a possibility that he did not finish the race.\n\nNext, let's consider the conclusion \"Alex did not finish the race.\" This statement is based on the assumption that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race. However, this conclusion is not necessarily true. It is possible that Alex finished the race and Chris did not finish the race.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Alex did not finish the race from the given information. The information provided does not provide enough evidence to make this conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No",
