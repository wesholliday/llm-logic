If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\n\nTo infer that the book was not written by James, we need to find a way to contradict the second premise. One way to do this is to assume that the book was written by James and then show that this assumption leads to a logical contradiction.\n\nAssuming that the book was written by James, we can conclude that the book must be a mystery novel, as per the second premise. However, this contradicts the first premise, which states that the book might not be a mystery novel. Therefore, we have reached a logical contradiction, and we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
