If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\n\nTo infer 'The apple was not red', we need to use a logical deduction. We can do this by using a logical fallacy called 'affirming the consequent'. This fallacy occurs when we assume that the conclusion of a conditional statement is true, even if the premise is false.\n\nIn this case, the premise is 'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow', and the conclusion is 'The apple was not red'. However, if we assume that the apple was red, then we can conclude that the banana must have been yellow, which is not necessarily true. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The apple was not red' from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
