If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\n\nTo infer that the doll was not plastic, we need to assume that the truck was metal. This is because the second premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. Therefore, if the truck was not metal, then the doll must not have been plastic.\n\nHowever, the first premise states that the truck might not have been metal. This means that we cannot assume that the truck was metal, and therefore we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: No",
