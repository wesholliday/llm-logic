If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nTo infer 'Joe did not go to the park', we need to analyze the given information and determine whether it is possible to draw such a conclusion.\n\nFirst, let's consider the premise 'Lucy might not have gone to the zoo'. This statement does not provide any information about Joe's actions, so it does not help us to infer anything about Joe's presence at the park.\n\nNext, let's look at the second premise 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo'. This statement implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo as well. However, this statement does not provide any information about Joe's actions, so it does not help us to infer anything about Joe's presence at the park.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'Joe did not go to the park'. The only conclusion we can draw is that Lucy might not have gone to the zoo, but we cannot say anything about Joe's actions.\n\nAnswer: No",
