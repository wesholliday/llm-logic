            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given information is a classic example of a logical contradiction. The first statement, \"Sue might not have been at the wedding,\" implies that Sue was not at the wedding, but the second statement, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding,\" implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. This creates a logical contradiction, as the first statement implies that Sue was not at the wedding, but the second statement implies that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding from the given information. The information is contradictory, and we cannot draw any conclusions from it.\n\nAnswer: no",
