            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premises and the conclusion. The first premise states that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. This premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the 'then') is true. In this case, the antecedent is 'the dog was inside', and the consequent is 'the cat was outside'.\n\nThe second premise states that the cat was not outside. This premise is a simple statement, which means that it is either true or false regardless of the truth or falsehood of the first premise.\n\nThe conclusion states that the dog was not inside. This conclusion is also a simple statement, which means that it is either true or false regardless of the truth or falsehood of the premises.\n\nNow, let's examine the argument in more detail. If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside. Therefore, if the dog was inside, then the cat was not outside, and if the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside.\n\nIn other words, the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
