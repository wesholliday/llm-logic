            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is \"Joe did not go to the park\" and the premises are \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" and \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\"\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion. In this case, the conclusion logically follows from the premises if we assume that the premises are true.\n\nThe first premise states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. This means that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo. This is a logical implication, which means that if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nThe second premise states that Lucy did not go to the zoo. This means that Lucy did not go to the zoo, regardless of whether Joe went to the park or not.\n\nTherefore, if we assume that the first premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true. In other words, if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo. This means that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
