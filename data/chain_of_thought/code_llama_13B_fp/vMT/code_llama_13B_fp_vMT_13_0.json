            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is \"The car was not red\" and the premises are \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" and \"The truck was not blue\".\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. In this case, the conclusion is the negation of the first premise, which means that the conclusion logically follows from the premises if the first premise is true.\n\nHowever, the first premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true. In this case, the antecedent is \"the car was red\", and the consequent is \"the truck was blue\".\n\nIf the antecedent is false, then the conditional statement is true regardless of the truth value of the consequent. This means that the first premise is logically valid even if the consequent is false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises, even though the first premise is a conditional statement that is only true if the antecedent is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
