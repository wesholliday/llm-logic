            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premises and conclusion and determine whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. This means that if the cake was chocolate, then it is necessarily true that the muffins were blueberry.\n\nThe second premise states that the muffins were not blueberry. This means that it is necessarily true that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nThe conclusion states that the cake was not chocolate. This means that it is necessarily true that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In other words, we need to determine whether it is necessarily true that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry, and if the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\n\nTo do this, we need to use logical reasoning. We can use a truth table to determine whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nHere is the truth table for the argument:\n\n| Premise 1 | Premise 2 | Conclusion |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| T | T | T |\n| T | F | F |\n| F | T | F |\n| F | F | T |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
