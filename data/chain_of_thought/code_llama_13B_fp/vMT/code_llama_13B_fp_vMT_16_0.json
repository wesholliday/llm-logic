            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is \"The shirt was not cotton\" and the premises are \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" and \"The pants were not denim\".\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. In this case, the conclusion is the negation of the first premise, which means that the conclusion logically follows from the premises if the first premise is true.\n\nHowever, the second premise \"The pants were not denim\" does not provide any information about the shirt. It only provides information about the pants. Therefore, the argument is logically valid only if the first premise \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
