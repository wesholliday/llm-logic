In this case, the conclusion is \"Sue did not choose pizza\" and the premises are \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" and \"Bob did not choose pasta.\"\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. In this case, the conclusion is the negation of the first premise, which means that the conclusion logically follows from the premises if the first premise is true.\n\nHowever, the first premise is not necessarily true. It is possible that Sue chose pizza and Bob chose pasta, in which case the conclusion would be false. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
