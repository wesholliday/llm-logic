In this case, the conclusion is logically deduced from the premises if the argument is in the form of a conditional statement.\n\nThe first premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. This means that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\n\nThe second premise states that the banana was not yellow. This means that the banana was not red.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that the apple was not red can be logically deduced from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
