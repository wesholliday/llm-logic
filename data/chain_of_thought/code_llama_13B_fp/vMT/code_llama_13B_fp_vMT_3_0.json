The first premise states that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. The second premise states that the book is not a mystery novel. The conclusion states that the book was not written by James.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it is based on the principle of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot both be true and false at the same time. In this case, the first premise and the second premise are contradictory, which means that they cannot both be true. Therefore, the conclusion must be true, which is that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
