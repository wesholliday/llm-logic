            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is \"The vampire was not awake\" and the premises are \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" and \"The mummy was not awake.\"\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. In this case, the conclusion is the negation of the first premise, which means that the conclusion follows from the premises if the first premise is true.\n\nHowever, the first premise is not necessarily true. The premise \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the condition (i.e., \"the vampire was awake\") is true. If the condition is false, then the conclusion of the premise (i.e., \"the mummy was awake\") is also false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid if the condition (i.e., \"the vampire was awake\") is true. If the condition is false, then the argument is logically invalid.\n\nAnswer: No",
