            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it is a valid argument from a conditional premise to a negative conclusion. The first premise states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. The second premise states that Erin did not take a train. The conclusion states that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because the first premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the 'then') is true. In this case, the antecedent is 'Sam took a plane', and the consequent is 'Erin took a train'. If the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n\nThe second premise states that Erin did not take a train. This premise is a negative statement, which means that it is only true if the statement before the 'not' is false. In this case, the statement before the 'not' is 'Erin took a train', which is the consequent of the first premise. Therefore, if the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false.\n\nThe conclusion states that Sam did not take a plane. This conclusion is a negative statement, which means that it is only true if the statement before the 'not' is false. In this case, the statement before the 'not' is 'Sam took a plane', which is the antecedent of the first premise. Therefore, if the antecedent is false, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the first premise is a conditional statement, the second premise is a negative statement, and the conclusion is a negative statement. The argument is valid because the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
