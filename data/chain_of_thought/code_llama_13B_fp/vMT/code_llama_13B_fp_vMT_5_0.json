The first premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. The second premise states that Amy did not play tennis. The conclusion states that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because the first premise and the second premise are contradictory, which means that the conclusion must be true. In other words, if Jeff did not play basketball, then the first premise is false, and the second premise is true. Therefore, the conclusion is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
