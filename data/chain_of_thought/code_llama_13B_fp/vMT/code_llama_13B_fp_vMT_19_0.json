            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it is a valid argument from a conditional premise to a negative conclusion. The first premise states that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. The second premise states that Jen did not watch basketball. The conclusion states that Tom did not watch football.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because the first premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the 'then') is true. In this case, the antecedent is 'Tom watched football', and the consequent is 'Jen watched basketball'. If the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n\nThe second premise states that Jen did not watch basketball. This premise is a negative statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the 'did not') is false. In this case, the antecedent is 'Jen watched basketball', and the consequent is 'Jen did not watch basketball'. If the antecedent is false, then the consequent must also be true.\n\nThe conclusion states that Tom did not watch football. This conclusion is a negative statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the 'did not') is false. In this case, the antecedent is 'Tom watched football', and the consequent is 'Tom did not watch football'. If the antecedent is false, then the consequent must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the first premise is a conditional statement, the second premise is a negative statement, and the conclusion is a negative statement. The argument is valid because the premises logically imply the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
