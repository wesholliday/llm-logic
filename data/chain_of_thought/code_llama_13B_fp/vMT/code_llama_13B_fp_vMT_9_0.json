            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt,\" and the premises are \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" and \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the logical relationships between the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. The first premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This means that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n2. The second premise states that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n3. The conclusion states that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to see whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion logically follows from the premises because the first premise implies that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt, and the second premise states that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
