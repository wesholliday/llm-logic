            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it is a valid syllogism. The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the 'then') is true. In this case, the antecedent is 'Mary was at the wedding', and the consequent is 'Sue was at the wedding'. If the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n\nThe second premise is a negation, which means that it is only true if the statement it negates is false. In this case, the statement being negated is 'Sue was at the wedding'. If the statement is false, then the negation is true.\n\nThe conclusion is a negation, which means that it is only true if the statement it negates is false. In this case, the statement being negated is 'Mary was at the wedding'. If the statement is false, then the negation is true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the premises logically imply the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
