However, the second statement, \"The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen,\" provides additional information that the phone is not in the kitchen.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the phone is not in the kitchen. Therefore, we can infer that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
