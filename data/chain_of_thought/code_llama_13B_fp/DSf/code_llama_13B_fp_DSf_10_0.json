The first statement says that the missing sock is either under the bed or in the laundry basket. The second statement says that the missing sock is not under the bed.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the missing sock is not under the bed. However, we do not know whether the missing sock is in the laundry basket or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: No",
