The statement states that either the keys are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer. Additionally, it is also stated that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet. However, this does not necessarily mean that the keys are in the drawer. The statement only provides us with the information that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, and it does not rule out the possibility that the keys are in the cabinet.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the keys are in the drawer based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
