This means that if the shoes are not lined up by the door, then they must be in the closet.\n\nThe second statement says that the shoes are not lined up by the door. This means that the shoes are not in the closet, because if they were, they would be lined up by the door.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
