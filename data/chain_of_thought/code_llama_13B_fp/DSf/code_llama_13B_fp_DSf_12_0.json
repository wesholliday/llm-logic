If the jacket is not in the closet, then it must be draped over the chair.\n\nThe second statement, \"The jacket isn't hanging in the closet,\" tells us that the jacket is not in the closet. This means that the jacket must be draped over the chair.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
