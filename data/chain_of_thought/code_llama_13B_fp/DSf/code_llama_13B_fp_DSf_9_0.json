The information only states that the missing puzzle piece is either blending in on the floor or it is in the box, and that it is not blending in on the floor. This does not necessarily mean that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nFor example, the missing puzzle piece could be in a different location, such as on the table or in a different room. The information provided does not rule out these possibilities, so we cannot infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: No",
