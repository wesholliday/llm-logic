The second statement, 'Either the cat is napping on the couch or it's playing in the bedroom,' implies that the cat is either napping on the couch or playing in the bedroom.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not provide any information about the cat's location in the bedroom. Therefore, we cannot infer that the cat is napping on the couch from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
