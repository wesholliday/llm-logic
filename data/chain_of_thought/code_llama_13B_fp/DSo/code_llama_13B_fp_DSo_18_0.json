The first statement states that the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand. The second statement states that either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand.\n\nBased on the information provided, we cannot infer that the notebook is in the drawer. The second statement only tells us that the notebook is either in the drawer or sitting on the nightstand, but it does not exclude the possibility that the notebook is sitting on the nightstand. Therefore, we cannot infer that the notebook is in the drawer based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No",
