The first statement states that the umbrella is not tucked away in the closet. The second statement states that either the umbrella is in the car or it is tucked away in the closet.\n\nBased on the information provided, we cannot infer that the umbrella is in the car. The second statement only tells us that the umbrella is either in the car or tucked away in the closet, but it does not provide any additional information about the umbrella's location. Therefore, we cannot infer that the umbrella is in the car based solely on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No",
