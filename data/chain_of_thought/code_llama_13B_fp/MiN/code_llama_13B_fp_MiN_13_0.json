The statement only states that the toy is not in the toy box, but it does not rule out the possibility that the toy might be in the toy box.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\" from the statement \"The toy might not be in the toy box.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
