However, this does not necessarily mean that it is not the case that the scarf must be stuffed in the backpack.\n\nFor example, if the statement \"The scarf might not be stuffed in my backpack\" is true, then it is possible that the scarf is not stuffed in the backpack. However, it is also possible that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack, and the statement is simply not true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the scarf must be stuffed in my backpack\" from the statement \"The scarf might not be stuffed in my backpack.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
