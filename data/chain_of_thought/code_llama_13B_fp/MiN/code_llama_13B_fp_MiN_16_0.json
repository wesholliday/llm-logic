This statement does not provide any information about the pen's location, and it does not rule out the possibility that the pen is in the bag.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag\" from this statement. The statement only implies that the pen might not be in the bag, but it does not provide any information about the pen's location.\n\nAnswer: No",
