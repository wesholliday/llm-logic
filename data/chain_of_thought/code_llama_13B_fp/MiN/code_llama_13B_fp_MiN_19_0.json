This statement does not provide any information about whether the watch is charging or not, it only states that it might not be charging.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser\" from this statement. The statement only provides a possibility, not a certainty.\n\nAnswer: No",
