The statement only states that the griffin might not have been in the forest, which means that there is a possibility that it was not in the forest.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\" from the given statement. The statement only implies that the griffin might not have been in the forest, which means that there is a possibility that it was not in the forest, but it does not necessarily mean that it was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: No",
