The question states that either the pen is in my bag or it is on my desk, and it also states that the pen is not on my desk.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the pen is in my bag. This is because the question states that the pen is either in my bag or on my desk, and it also states that the pen is not on my desk. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the pen is in my bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
