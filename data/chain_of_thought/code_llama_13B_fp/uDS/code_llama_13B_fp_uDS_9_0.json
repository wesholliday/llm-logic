The missing puzzle piece is either in the box or blending in on the floor.\n2. The missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor.\n\nBased on these two pieces of information, we can conclude that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. The first piece of information tells us that the missing puzzle piece is either in the box or blending in on the floor. This means that the missing puzzle piece is either in the box or not in the box.\n2. The second piece of information tells us that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor. This means that the missing puzzle piece is not in the floor.\n3. Since the missing puzzle piece is not in the floor, it must be in the box.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
