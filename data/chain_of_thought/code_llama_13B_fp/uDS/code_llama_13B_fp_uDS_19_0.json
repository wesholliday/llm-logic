The first piece of information is that the watch is not on the person's wrist. The second piece of information is that the watch is either charging on the dresser or it is on the person's wrist.\n\nTo infer whether the watch is charging on the dresser, we need to consider the information provided and the relationships between the different pieces of information. In this case, we know that the watch is not on the person's wrist, so it must be either charging on the dresser or it is not charging at all.\n\nSince we are given that the watch is not on the person's wrist, we can infer that the watch is not charging on the person's wrist. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
