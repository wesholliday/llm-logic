The question states that either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it's under the bed. It also states that the missing sock isn't under the bed.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the missing sock is in the laundry basket. This is because the question provides two mutually exclusive options: either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it's under the bed. Since the question states that the missing sock isn't under the bed, we can infer that it must be in the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.",
