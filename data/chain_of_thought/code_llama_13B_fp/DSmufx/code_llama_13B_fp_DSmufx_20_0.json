This means that if the fleeg is not surned, it must be bluttered.\n\nThe second statement, 'It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned,' suggests that the fleeg does not have to be surned. This means that the fleeg could be either surned or bluttered, depending on the circumstances.\n\nBased on these statements, we cannot infer that the fleeg is bluttered. The fleeg could be either surned or bluttered, depending on the circumstances. Therefore, the answer is 'no'.",
