In this case, the two statements are 'The wug must be bimmed' and 'The wug is flooped'.\n\n'It's not the case that the wug must be bimmed' is a negation, which means that the statement 'The wug must be bimmed' is false.\n\nNow, we can use the principle of explosion to determine whether we can infer 'The wug is flooped' from the given information. The principle of explosion states that if we have a disjunction of two statements, and one of the statements is false, then the other statement must be true.\n\nIn this case, we have a disjunction of 'The wug must be bimmed' and 'The wug is flooped', and we know that 'The wug must be bimmed' is false. Therefore, by the principle of explosion, we can infer that 'The wug is flooped' must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
