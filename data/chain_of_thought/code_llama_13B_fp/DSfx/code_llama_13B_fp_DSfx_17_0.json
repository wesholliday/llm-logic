In this case, the two statements are 'The flob is movated' and 'The flob is skizzled'.\n\n'The flob is not movated' is a negative statement, which means that it is true if the statement 'The flob is movated' is false.\n\nNow, we need to consider the logical relationships between these statements. If 'The flob is movated' is false, then 'The flob is not movated' is true. If 'The flob is skizzled' is true, then 'The flob is not movated' is also true. Therefore, we can infer that 'The flob is skizzled' is true if 'The flob is not movated' is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
