In this case, the two statements are 'The fleeg is surned' and 'The fleeg is bluttered'.\n\n'The fleeg is not surned' is a negative statement, which means that it is true if the statement 'The fleeg is surned' is false.\n\nNow, we need to consider the logical relationships between these statements. If 'The fleeg is not surned', then it must be the case that 'The fleeg is bluttered', since 'The fleeg is surned' is false. Therefore, we can infer that 'The fleeg is bluttered' from 'Either the fleeg is surned or it is bluttered' together with 'The fleeg is not surned'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
