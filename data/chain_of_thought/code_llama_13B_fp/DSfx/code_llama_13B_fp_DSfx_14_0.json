If the clug is snugged, then the statement 'The clug is snugged' is true, and if the clug is fleeked, then the statement 'The clug is fleeked' is true.\n\nOn the other hand, 'The clug is not snugged' is a negation, which means that the statement 'The clug is snugged' is false.\n\nNow, we can use the principle of excluded middle to determine whether we can infer 'The clug is fleeked' from the given statements. The excluded middle principle states that for any proposition, either the proposition is true or its negation is true. In this case, we can infer that either 'The clug is snugged' or 'The clug is fleeked' is true.\n\nSince we know that 'The clug is not snugged', we can conclude that 'The clug is fleeked' must be true. Therefore, the answer is 'yes'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
