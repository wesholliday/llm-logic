The statement \"Either the flug is zimmed or it is blummed\" is a logical contradiction, as it implies that the flug is either zimmed or blummed, but it does not provide any information about which of these two options is true. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the flug's status based on this statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
