The shank is not nugged.\n\nTo infer that the shank is plooked, we need to analyze the given information and determine whether it is logically possible to conclude that the shank is plooked based on the information provided.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possibility that the shank is nugged. If the shank is nugged, then it is not plooked. Therefore, if we know that the shank is not nugged, we can conclude that it is plooked.\n\nHowever, the given information also states that either the shank is nugged or it is plooked. This means that if the shank is not nugged, then it must be plooked. Therefore, we can conclude that the shank is plooked based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
