The splat is not quanked.\n\nTo infer that the splat is morphed, we need to analyze the given information and determine whether it is possible to conclude that the splat is morphed based on the information provided.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first statement: \"Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed.\" This statement suggests that the splat can be either quanked or morphed.\n\nNext, let's consider the second statement: \"The splat is not quanked.\" This statement tells us that the splat is not quanked.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information provided:\n\n1. The splat can be either quanked or morphed.\n2. The splat is not quanked.\n\nBased on the information provided, we can conclude that the splat is morphed. This is because the first statement suggests that the splat can be either quanked or morphed, and the second statement tells us that the splat is not quanked. Therefore, we can infer that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
