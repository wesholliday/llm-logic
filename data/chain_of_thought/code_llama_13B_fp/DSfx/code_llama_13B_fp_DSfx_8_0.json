            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given information is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If the sprocket is daggled, then it is cranked.\" The second statement, \"The sprocket is not daggled,\" is a negation of the first statement, which can be represented as \"The sprocket is not daggled.\"\n\nTo infer that the sprocket is cranked, we need to use the law of excluded middle, which states that a statement is either true or false. In this case, we can infer that the sprocket is cranked because the first statement implies that if the sprocket is daggled, then it is cranked, and the second statement states that the sprocket is not daggled. Therefore, we can conclude that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
