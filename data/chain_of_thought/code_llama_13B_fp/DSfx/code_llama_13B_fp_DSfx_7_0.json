The first statement implies that the whiffle is either tinked or shanked, while the second statement states that the whiffle is not tinked. This means that the whiffle cannot be both tinked and shanked, as these two statements are mutually exclusive. Therefore, we cannot infer that the whiffle is shanked from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
