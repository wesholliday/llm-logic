The statement 'The book might be on the shelf or in the library' implies that there are two possible locations where the book could be: either on the shelf or in the library. This is an 'or' statement, which means that the book could be in one of the two locations, but not necessarily both. Since 'on the shelf' is one of the two possible locations, it is a possible scenario. Therefore, we can infer that 'The book might be on the shelf'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
