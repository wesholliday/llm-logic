The second part of the statement, \"The envelope might be under a bed,\" is one of the two possibilities explicitly mentioned. Therefore, we can logically infer that if the envelope is under a bed or upstairs, and one of those options is \"under a bed,\" then it is indeed possible for the envelope to be under a bed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
