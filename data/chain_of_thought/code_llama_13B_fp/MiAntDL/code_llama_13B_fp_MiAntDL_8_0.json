            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The restaurant might be closed on Mondays or open for limited hours\" is a disjunctive statement, which means it presents two alternative possibilities. The word \"or\" indicates that the restaurant is either closed on Mondays or open for limited hours, but not necessarily both. This statement does not provide any information about the restaurant's hours on days other than Mondays. Therefore, we can infer that the restaurant might be closed on Mondays, but we cannot infer anything about its hours on other days.\n\nAnswer: yes"
