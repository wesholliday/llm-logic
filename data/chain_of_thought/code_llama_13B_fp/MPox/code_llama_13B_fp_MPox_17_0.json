However, they are not the same statement. 'The flob was skizzled' is a statement that describes a specific event, while 'If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated' is a statement that contains a conditional clause.\n\nThe conditional clause in 'If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated' is a statement that is only true if the first part of the clause is true. In this case, the first part of the clause is 'the flob was skizzled'. Therefore, the conditional clause is only true if 'the flob was skizzled' is also true.\n\nSince 'The flob was skizzled' and 'If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated' are not the same statement, we cannot infer 'The flob movated' from 'The flob was skizzled' together with 'If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated'.\n\nAnswer: No",
