'If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged' is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part of the statement is true, then the second part of the statement must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the first part of the statement is 'The smonk was vreebled', which is a fact. Therefore, we can infer that the second part of the statement, 'The smonk plagged', must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
