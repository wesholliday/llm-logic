            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package must have been delivered by truck or by plane\" is a disjunction, which means it presents two alternatives as mutually exclusive options. The word \"or\" in this context implies that the package was either delivered by truck or by plane, but not both. The statement does not provide any information about the possibility of the package being delivered by both truck and plane, or by neither. Therefore, we cannot infer that the package must have been delivered by truck or it must have been delivered by plane, because the original statement does not rule out the possibility of the package being delivered by both or by neither.\n\nAnswer: no"
