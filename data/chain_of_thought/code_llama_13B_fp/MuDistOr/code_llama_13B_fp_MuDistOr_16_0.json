            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a compound sentence with a coordinating conjunction \"or\" connecting two clauses. This conjunction indicates that either one of the clauses can be true, but not necessarily both. The original statement implies that the contract was approved by either the legal team or the CEO, but it does not necessarily mean that it was approved by both. Therefore, we can infer that the contract must have been approved by the legal team or it must have been approved by the CEO, as the original statement already implies this possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes"
