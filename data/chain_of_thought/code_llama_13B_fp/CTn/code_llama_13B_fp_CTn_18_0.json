However, this does not necessarily mean that if the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic.\n\nFor example, if the doll was plastic and the truck was metal, then the implication is true. However, if the doll was plastic and the truck was not metal (e.g. it was made of wood), then the implication is still true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: No",
