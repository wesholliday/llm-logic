In this case, the condition is that Jeff played basketball. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy did not play tennis. This means that if Jeff played basketball, then it is not the case that Amy played tennis.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that if Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball. This is because the original statement only deals with the relationship between Jeff and Amy, and does not provide any information about the relationship between Amy and anyone else. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: No",
