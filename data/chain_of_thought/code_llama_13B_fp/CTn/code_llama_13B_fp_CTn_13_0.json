In this case, the condition is that the car is red. If the car is red, then the truck is not blue.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that if the truck is blue, then the car is not red. The statement only says that if the car is red, then the truck is not blue. It does not say anything about what happens if the truck is blue.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the truck is blue, then the car is not red. The statement only provides information about the relationship between the car and the truck if the car is red.\n\nAnswer: No",
