In this case, the condition is that the dog was inside. If the dog was inside, then the cat was not outside.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that if the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside. The statement only says that if the dog was inside, then the cat was not outside. It does not say anything about what happens if the cat is outside.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside. The statement only provides information about the relationship between the dog and the cat when the dog is inside.\n\nAnswer: No",
