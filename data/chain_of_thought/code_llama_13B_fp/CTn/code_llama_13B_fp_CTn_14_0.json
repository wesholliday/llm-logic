In this case, the condition is that the bear is in the cave. If the bear is in the cave, then the wolf is not in the den.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that if the wolf is in the den, then the bear is not in the cave. The statement only implies that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf is not in the den. It does not say anything about the opposite situation, where the wolf is in the den and the bear is not in the cave.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the wolf is in the den, then the bear is not in the cave. The statement only provides information about the relationship between the bear and the wolf in the cave, and does not provide any information about the relationship between the wolf and the bear in the den.\n\nAnswer: No",
