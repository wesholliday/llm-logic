In this case, the premise is \"Alex finished the race,\" and the conclusion is \"Chris did not finish the race.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex did not finish the race,\" we need to analyze the logical structure of the implication. The implication is of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is the premise and Q is the conclusion.\n\nThe logical structure of the implication is as follows:\n\n1. If Alex finished the race, then Chris did not finish the race. (Premise)\n2. If Chris finished the race, then Alex did not finish the race. (Conclusion)\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premise, which means that the implication is valid. This means that we can infer the conclusion from the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
