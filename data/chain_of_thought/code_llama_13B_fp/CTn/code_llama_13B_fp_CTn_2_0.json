However, this does not necessarily mean that if the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nTo see why, consider the following counterexample:\n\n* The griffin is in the forest.\n* The unicorn is not in the forest.\n\nIn this case, the statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest\" is true, but the statement \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\" is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: No",
