In this case, the condition is that the book was written by James.\n\nTo infer the opposite of the given statement, we need to flip the condition and the conclusion. This means that we need to change the condition from \"the book was written by James\" to \"the book is a mystery novel\" and the conclusion from \"the book is not a mystery novel\" to \"the book was written by James\".\n\nTherefore, the inferred statement would be: \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
