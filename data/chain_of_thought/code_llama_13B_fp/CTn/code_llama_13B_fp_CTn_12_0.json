In this case, the condition is that Joe went to the park. If this condition is met, then the statement is true.\n\nHowever, the statement does not provide any information about what happens if Lucy goes to the zoo. It only states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo. This means that if Lucy goes to the zoo, then we cannot infer anything about Joe's actions.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park. The statement does not provide enough information to make such an inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
