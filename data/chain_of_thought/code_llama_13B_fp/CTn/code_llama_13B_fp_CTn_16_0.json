In this case, the condition is that the shirt is cotton. If the shirt is cotton, then the pants are not denim.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that if the pants are denim, then the shirt is not cotton. The statement only says that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are not denim. It does not say anything about the opposite case, where the pants are denim and the shirt is not cotton.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the pants are denim, then the shirt is not cotton. The statement only provides information about the relationship between the shirt and the pants when the shirt is cotton.\n\nAnswer: No",
