However, this does not necessarily mean that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake.\n\nThe reason for this is that the implication only goes one way, from vampire to mummy. It does not imply that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: No",
