In this case, the premise is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\" This means that if Mary was at the wedding, then it can be inferred that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nHowever, the conclusion \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\" is not necessarily true. It is possible that Sue was at the wedding and Mary was not, or that Sue was not at the wedding and Mary was. Therefore, we cannot infer the conclusion from the premise.\n\nAnswer: No",
