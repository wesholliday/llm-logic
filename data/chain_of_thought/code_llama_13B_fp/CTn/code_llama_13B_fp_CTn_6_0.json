This statement means that if Sue chose pizza, then it is certain that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion: 'If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza'. This statement means that if Bob chose pasta, then it is certain that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nThe question is whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise. To determine this, we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe premise states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta. The conclusion states that if Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nThe relationship between the two statements is that they are negations of each other. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta, and if Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza' from 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
