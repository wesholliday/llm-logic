In this case, the condition is that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nTo infer the second statement, we need to reverse the condition and the conclusion. This means that we need to take the conclusion of the first statement (Mark did not buy the blue shirt) and make it the condition of the second statement.\n\nSo, the second statement would be: \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
