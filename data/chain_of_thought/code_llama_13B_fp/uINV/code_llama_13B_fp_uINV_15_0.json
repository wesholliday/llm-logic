In this case, the condition is that Sam took a plane, and the statement is that Erin took a train.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train, we need to analyze the condition and the statement.\n\nThe condition is that Sam took a plane, which means that Sam did not take a plane if the statement is false. However, the statement is that Erin took a train, which means that Erin did not take a train if the condition is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train. The reason is that the condition and the statement are not necessarily related, and we cannot make any assumptions about Erin's actions based on Sam's actions.\n\nAnswer: No",
