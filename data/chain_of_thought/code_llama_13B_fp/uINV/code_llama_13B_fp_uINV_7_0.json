It means that if Alex did finish the race, then Chris must also have finished the race. However, this does not necessarily mean that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race.\n\nThere are several reasons why this is the case:\n\n1. The statement only applies to the specific scenario where Alex finished the race. If Alex did not finish the race, then the statement does not apply, and we cannot make any inferences about Chris's finishing the race.\n2. The statement is based on a logical implication, which means that it is only true if the premise (Alex finished the race) is true. If the premise is false (Alex did not finish the race), then the conclusion (Chris finished the race) is also false.\n3. The statement does not provide any information about Chris's finishing the race in any other scenario. It only applies to the specific scenario where Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: No",
