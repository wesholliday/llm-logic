            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement. It means that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then it is certain that Mark bought the blue shirt. However, it does not necessarily mean that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nThere are several reasons why we cannot infer that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt. Firstly, it is possible that Lisa and Mark bought the same shirt, but Lisa chose the red one and Mark chose the blue one. In this case, Lisa did not buy the red shirt, but Mark did buy the blue shirt.\n\nSecondly, it is possible that Lisa and Mark bought different shirts altogether. In this case, Lisa did not buy the red shirt, and Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: No",
