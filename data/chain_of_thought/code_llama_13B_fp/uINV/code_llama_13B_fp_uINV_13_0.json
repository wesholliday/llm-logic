It means that if the car was red, then it is also true that the truck was blue. However, it does not necessarily mean that if the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\n\nFor example, let's say that the car is actually blue and the truck is actually red. In this case, the statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is false, because the car is actually blue and the truck is actually red. However, it does not mean that if the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\n\nAnswer: No",
