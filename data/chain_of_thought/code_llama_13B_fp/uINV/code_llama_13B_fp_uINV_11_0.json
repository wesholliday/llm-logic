It means that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. However, it does not necessarily mean that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nThere are several reasons why we cannot infer that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry. First, the statement only mentions the cake and the muffins, and does not provide any information about the other ingredients or the cooking process. Second, the statement only mentions the color of the muffins, and does not provide any information about their taste or texture.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nAnswer: No",
