It means that if the griffin was in the forest, then it is also true that the unicorn was in the forest. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nFor example, if the griffin was in the forest and the unicorn was not in the forest, then the statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" would still be true, even though the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no",
