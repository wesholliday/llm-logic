In this case, the condition is that the shirt is cotton, and the statement is that the pants are denim.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim, we need to analyze the condition and the statement.\n\nThe condition is that the shirt is cotton, which means that the shirt is made of cotton fabric. The statement is that the pants are denim, which means that the pants are made of denim fabric.\n\nIf the shirt was not cotton, then it must be made of a different fabric, such as polyester or silk. In this case, the pants would not be denim, as denim is only made of cotton.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\n\nAnswer: yes",
