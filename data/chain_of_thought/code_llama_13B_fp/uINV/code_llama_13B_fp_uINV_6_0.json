It means that if Sue chose pizza, then it is certain that Bob chose pasta. However, it does not necessarily mean that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nFor example, if Sue chose pizza and Bob chose pasta, then it is certain that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta. However, if Sue did not choose pizza and Bob did choose pasta, then it is not necessarily true that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: No",
