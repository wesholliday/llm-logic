It means that if Mary was at the wedding, then it is certain that Sue was also at the wedding. However, this does not necessarily mean that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nThere are several reasons why this is the case:\n\n1. Mary and Sue could have been at the wedding together, but Mary was not present. In this case, it is still possible that Sue was at the wedding.\n2. Mary and Sue could have been at the wedding separately, but Mary was not present. In this case, it is still possible that Sue was at the wedding.\n3. Mary and Sue could have been at the wedding together, but Mary was not present and Sue was not present either. In this case, it is still possible that they were both not at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding. The only thing we can say for sure is that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding.",
