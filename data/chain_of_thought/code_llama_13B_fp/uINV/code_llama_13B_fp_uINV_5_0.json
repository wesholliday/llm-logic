            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that expresses a relationship between two events. The statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" can be written in symbolic form as:\n\nJeff played basketball \u2192 Amy played tennis\n\nThis statement is a conditional statement because it expresses a relationship between two events, where the event \"Jeff played basketball\" is the antecedent (the condition) and the event \"Amy played tennis\" is the consequent (the consequence).\n\nTo infer that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis, we need to apply the rules of conditional reasoning. The first rule of conditional reasoning is that if the antecedent is false, then the consequent is also false. In other words, if Jeff did not play basketball, then it is not necessarily the case that Amy played tennis.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is \"no\". We cannot infer that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.",
