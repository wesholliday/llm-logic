It means that if the dog was inside, then it is certain that the cat was outside. However, it does not necessarily mean that if the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside.\n\nFor example, if the dog was inside and the cat was outside, and then the dog was taken outside, it is still possible that the cat was still outside. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside.\n\nAnswer: No",
