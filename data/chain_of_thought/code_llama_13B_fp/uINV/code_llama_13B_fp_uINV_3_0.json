It means that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. However, the statement does not say anything about what happens if the book was not written by James.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel. The statement does not provide enough information to make such an inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
