            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that expresses a relationship between two events. The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" can be written in symbolic form as:\n\nTom watched football \u2192 Jen watched basketball\n\nThis statement is a conditional statement because it expresses a relationship between two events, where the event \"Tom watched football\" is the antecedent (the condition) and the event \"Jen watched basketball\" is the consequent (the consequence).\n\nTo infer that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball, we need to apply the contrapositive of the conditional statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is obtained by reversing the order of the antecedent and the consequent, and adding a \"not\" to the consequent.\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of the given statement is:\n\nNot (Tom watched football) \u2192 Not (Jen watched basketball)\n\nThis statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, and it can be used to infer that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
