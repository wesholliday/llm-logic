In this case, the condition is that the doll is plastic, and the statement is that the truck is metal.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that if the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal, we need to analyze the condition and the statement.\n\nThe condition is that the doll is plastic, which means that the doll is made of plastic. The statement is that the truck is metal, which means that the truck is made of metal.\n\nIf the doll was not plastic, then it would not be made of plastic. However, this does not necessarily mean that the truck would not be metal. There are many other materials that can be used to make trucks, such as steel, aluminum, or even wood.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal. The statement is not necessarily true, and we cannot make any conclusions based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
