            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that expresses a relationship between two events. The statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" can be written as \"If P, then Q\", where P is the event \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is the event \"Lucy went to the zoo\".\n\nThe question is asking whether we can infer that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo. To answer this question, we need to consider the relationship between the two events.\n\nIf Joe did not go to the park, then it is possible that Lucy did go to the zoo. For example, if Joe had a prior commitment and could not attend the park, Lucy might have gone to the zoo on her own. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: No",
