The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a logical fallacy known as a faulty cause. This means that the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nIn order to determine whether we can infer that Mark bought the blue shirt, we need to look at the information provided in the question. The question states that Lisa bought the red shirt, but it does not say anything about Mark buying the blue shirt. Therefore, we cannot infer that Mark bought the blue shirt based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No",
