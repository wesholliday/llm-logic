This is a specific piece of information that we can rely on.\n\nThe second piece of information tells us that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. This is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the first part of the statement (the doll is plastic) is true.\n\nHowever, we don't know whether the doll is plastic or not. We only know that it is plastic, but we don't know whether it is plastic or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that the truck is metal based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
