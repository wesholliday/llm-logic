It means that if the apple was red, then it is also true that the banana was yellow. However, this statement does not necessarily mean that the banana was yellow just because the apple was red.\n\nIn order to infer that the banana was yellow, we would need to know more information about the apple and the banana. For example, if we knew that the apple was red and the banana was not yellow, then we could infer that the banana was not yellow. However, if we only know that the apple was red and nothing else, then we cannot infer that the banana was yellow.\n\nAnswer: No",
