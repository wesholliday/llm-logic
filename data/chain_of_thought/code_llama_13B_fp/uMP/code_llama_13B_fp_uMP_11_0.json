This means that if the cake is not chocolate, then the muffins are not necessarily blueberry.\n\nThe second statement states that the cake is chocolate.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot infer that the muffins were blueberry. The first statement only implies that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry, but it does not state that the muffins are necessarily blueberry if the cake is chocolate. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the muffins were blueberry based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
