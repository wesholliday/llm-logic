It means that if the bear was in the cave, then it is also true that the wolf was in the den.\n\nThe second statement \"The bear was in the cave\" is a fact.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the wolf was in the den, we need to evaluate the conditional statement based on the fact that the bear was in the cave.\n\nIf the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n\nSince the bear was in the cave, we can infer that the wolf was in the den.\n\nAnswer: yes",
