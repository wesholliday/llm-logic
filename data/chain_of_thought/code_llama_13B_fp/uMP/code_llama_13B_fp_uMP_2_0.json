However, the question does not provide enough information to determine whether the unicorn was in the forest or not.\n\nThe statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" is a logical implication, but it does not necessarily mean that the unicorn was in the forest. The implication only states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was also in the forest. It does not provide any information about the location of the unicorn if the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the unicorn was in the forest based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No",
