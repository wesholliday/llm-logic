If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. This means that if the bear was in the cave, the wolf must have been in the den.\n2. The wolf was not in the den. This means that the wolf was not in the den, regardless of whether the bear was in the cave or not.\n\nBased on the information provided, we cannot infer that the bear was not in the cave. The wolf was not in the den, but this does not necessarily mean that the bear was not in the cave. The bear could have been in the cave and the wolf could have been in the den, or the bear could have been in the den and the wolf could have been in the cave.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no, we cannot infer that the bear was not in the cave.",
