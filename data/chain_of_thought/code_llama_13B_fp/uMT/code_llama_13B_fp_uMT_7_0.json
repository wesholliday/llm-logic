Chris did not finish the race.\n\nTo determine whether Alex finished the race, we need to analyze the given information and determine whether it is possible for Alex to have finished the race based on the information provided.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first statement: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This statement implies that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must also have finished the race. However, we are also given the second statement: \"Chris did not finish the race.\" This statement contradicts the first statement, as it implies that Chris did not finish the race, which means that Alex did not finish the race either.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that Alex finished the race. The only conclusion we can draw is that Alex did not finish the race, as the second statement contradicts the first statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
