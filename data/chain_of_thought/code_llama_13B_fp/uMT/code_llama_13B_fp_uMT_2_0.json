However, the second statement states that the unicorn was not in the forest. This creates a contradiction, as the first statement implies that the unicorn must be in the forest, but the second statement states that the unicorn is not in the forest.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the griffin was not in the forest based on the given information. The griffin could have been in the forest or not in the forest, and we cannot determine which based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
