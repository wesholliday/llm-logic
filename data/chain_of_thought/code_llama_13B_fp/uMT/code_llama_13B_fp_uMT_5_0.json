This means that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. However, we are also told that Amy did not play tennis. This creates a contradiction, as we cannot have both Jeff playing basketball and Amy not playing tennis.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Jeff did not play basketball based on the given information. The only conclusion we can draw is that Jeff played basketball and Amy did not play tennis.\n\nAnswer: No",
