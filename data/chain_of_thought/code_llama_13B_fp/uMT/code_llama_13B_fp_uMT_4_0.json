We can start by assuming that the alien visited Mars and then see if the information provided allows us to conclude that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nIf the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. This means that the robot visited Jupiter because the alien visited Mars. However, the robot did not visit Jupiter. This means that the robot did not visit Jupiter because the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
