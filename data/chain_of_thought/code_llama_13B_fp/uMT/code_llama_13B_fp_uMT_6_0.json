The first statement says that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. The second statement says that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. However, the second statement also says that Bob did not choose pasta. This creates a contradiction, as we cannot have both that Bob chose pasta and that he did not choose pasta.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Sue did not choose pizza based on the information provided. The statements are inconsistent, and we cannot draw any conclusions about Sue's choice of food.\n\nAnswer: no",
