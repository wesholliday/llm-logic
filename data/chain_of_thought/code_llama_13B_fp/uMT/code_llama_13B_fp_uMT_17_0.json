Kate did not eat salad.\n\nTo determine whether Ben did not eat pasta, we need to analyze the given information and determine whether it is possible for Ben to have eaten pasta while Kate did not eat salad.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first statement: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This statement implies that if Ben ate pasta, then it is also true that Kate ate salad. However, we are not given any information about whether Kate ate salad or not.\n\nNext, let's consider the second statement: \"Kate did not eat salad.\" This statement tells us that Kate did not eat salad.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information we have gathered so far. We know that Ben ate pasta, and we know that Kate did not eat salad. However, we do not know whether Kate ate salad or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether Ben ate pasta or not.\n\nIn conclusion, we cannot infer that Ben did not eat pasta based on the given information. The information does not provide enough information to make a conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No",
