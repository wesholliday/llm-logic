However, we cannot infer that \"The fribble was snurgled\" is true based solely on these two statements.\n\nThe reason for this is that the statement \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\" does not necessarily imply that \"The fribble was snurgled\" is true. It only implies that if \"The fribble was snurgled\" is true, then \"The fribble crinked\" is also true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The fribble was snurgled\" is true based solely on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
