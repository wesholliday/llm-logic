If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\n\nTo infer that the twonk was plinked, we need to use the second premise to deduce that the twonk was plinked. However, the second premise is a conditional statement, which means that it only implies that the twonk was plinked if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true. In this case, the antecedent is \"the twonk was plinked.\"\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the twonk was plinked from the given premises. The only thing we can infer is that the twonk was varnished, which is the first premise.\n\nAnswer: No",
