If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\n\nTo infer 'The whiffle was shanked', we need to use modus ponens, which is a valid inference rule in classical logic. Modus ponens states that if we have a premise of the form 'if P, then Q' and a premise of the form 'P', then we can infer 'Q'.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is 'If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked', and the second premise is 'The whiffle tinked'. Therefore, we can apply modus ponens to infer 'The whiffle was shanked'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
