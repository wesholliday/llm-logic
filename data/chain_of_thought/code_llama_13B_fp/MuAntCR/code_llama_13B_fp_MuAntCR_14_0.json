            "content": "Explanation: To infer 'The contract must have been valid for a year and been renewable', we need to analyze the given statement 'The contract must have been renewable'. The word 'renewable' implies that the contract had a term or duration, and that it could be extended or renewed after that term. This suggests that the contract was not a one-time agreement, but rather a recurring or periodic one. Given that it was renewable, it is reasonable to infer that the contract had a specific duration, such as a year, after which it could be renewed. This inference is based on the common understanding of what it means for a contract to be renewable.\n\nAnswer: yes"
