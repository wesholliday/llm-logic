The first premise is a disjunction, which means that it is a statement that is either true or false. The second premise is a negation, which means that it is a statement that is either true or false. The conclusion is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that is either true or false.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it follows the rules of inference.
