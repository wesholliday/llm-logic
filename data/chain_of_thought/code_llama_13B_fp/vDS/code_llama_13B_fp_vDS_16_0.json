The first premise is a conditional statement, \"Either the pen is in my bag or it is on my desk,\" which is a disjunction of two mutually exclusive possibilities. The second premise is a negation of the second possibility, \"The pen isn't on my desk,\" which is a contradiction of the first premise. The conclusion is the first possibility, \"The pen is in my bag,\" which follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
