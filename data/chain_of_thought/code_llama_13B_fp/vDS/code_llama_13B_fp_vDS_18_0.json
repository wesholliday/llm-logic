The first premise states that the notebook is either in the drawer or sitting on the nightstand, and the second premise states that the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand. The conclusion logically follows from these premises, as the only remaining possibility is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
