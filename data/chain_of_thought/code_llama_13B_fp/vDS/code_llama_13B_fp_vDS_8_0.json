The first premise is an inclusive disjunction, which means that it is possible for both options to be true. The second premise is a negation, which means that it is not the case that the remote control is hiding under the couch. The conclusion is a conditional statement, which means that if the first premise is true, then the second premise must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it follows the rules of logic and is a valid syllogism.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
