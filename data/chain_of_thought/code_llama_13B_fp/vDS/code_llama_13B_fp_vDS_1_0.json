The first premise states that Fido is either inside or in the garden, and the second premise states that Fido is not in the garden. The conclusion states that Fido is inside.\n\nThe argument is a form of categorical syllogism, which is a type of argument that uses the law of excluded middle (i.e., everything is either A or not-A) to deduce a conclusion. In this case, the law of excluded middle is used to deduce that if Fido is not in the garden, then Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
