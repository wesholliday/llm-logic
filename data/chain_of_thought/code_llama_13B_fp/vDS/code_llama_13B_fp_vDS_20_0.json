The first premise is a conditional statement, \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they are perched on her head,\" which can be logically equivalent to \"If the sunglasses are not in her bag, then they are perched on her head.\" The second premise is a negation of the second part of the conditional premise, \"The sunglasses aren't perched on her head.\" The conclusion is the first part of the conditional premise, \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
