The statement is saying that if the sneg (a type of animal) was crampled, then it would sproted (spurt) the frink (a type of liquid). However, the statement does not provide any information about what would happen if the sneg did not sproted the frink.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled. The statement does not provide enough information to make such an inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
