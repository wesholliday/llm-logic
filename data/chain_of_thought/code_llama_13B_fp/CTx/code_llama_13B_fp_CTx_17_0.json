The statement is trying to make a point about the relationship between the two verbs, but it is not a valid argument.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer the opposite of the given statement, we need to understand the meaning of the words being used. \"Skizzled\" and \"movated\" are not real words, so we cannot use them to make a logical argument.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the opposite of the given statement, because it is based on a false premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
