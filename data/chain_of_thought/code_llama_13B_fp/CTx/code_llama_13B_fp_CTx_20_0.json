The statement \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" is a statement that is trying to convey a logical relationship between two concepts, but it is not a valid statement because it is based on a false premise.\n\nThe concept of \"bluttered\" is not a well-defined or meaningful concept, and the statement \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" is not a valid statement because it is based on a false premise. Therefore, we cannot infer anything from this statement, including the statement \"If the fleeg did not surn, then the fleeg was not bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
