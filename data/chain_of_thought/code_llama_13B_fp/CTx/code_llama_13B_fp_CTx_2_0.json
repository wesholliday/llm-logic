In this case, the antecedent is \"If the wug was flooped,\" and the consequent is \"Then the wug bimmed the zoint.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped,\" we need to examine the relationship between the antecedent and the consequent. If the antecedent is true, does that necessarily mean that the consequent is also true?\n\nIn this case, if the wug was flooped, it does not necessarily mean that the wug bimmed the zoint. The wug could have been flooped for other reasons, such as being hit by a car or falling into a well. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped.\n\nAnswer: No",
