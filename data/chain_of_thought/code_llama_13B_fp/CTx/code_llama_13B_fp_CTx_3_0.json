However, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true. This is because the statement \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed\" is not a logical implication. It is possible for the splat to not quank and still be morphed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
