In this case, the antecedent is \"the fribble was snurgled\" and the consequent is \"the fribble crinked.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled,\" we need to consider the truth values of the two statements. If the first statement is true, then the second statement must also be true. However, if the first statement is false, then the second statement may or may not be true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
