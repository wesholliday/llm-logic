However, the converse of this implication (if the smonk did not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled) is not necessarily true.\n\nIn other words, just because the smonk did not plagged, it does not necessarily mean that it was not vreebled. There could be other reasons why the smonk did not plagged, such as it was not in a position to plag, or it did not have the ability to plag.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the converse of the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
