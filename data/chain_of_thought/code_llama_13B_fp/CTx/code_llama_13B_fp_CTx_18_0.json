The statement \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\" implies that if the shank was plooked, then it was also nugged. However, the statement \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked\" implies that if the shank was not nugged, then it was not plooked. This is a contradiction because if the shank was not nugged, then it was not plooked, but the first statement implies that if the shank was plooked, then it was also nugged. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
