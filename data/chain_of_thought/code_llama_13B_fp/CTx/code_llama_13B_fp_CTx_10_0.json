In this case, the antecedent is \"If the wug was sproinged,\" and the consequent is \"then it was garpled.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged\" from the given statement, we need to consider the truth values of the two statements.\n\nIf the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled. (True)\nIf the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged. (False)\n\nSince the antecedent of the second statement is false, the consequent must also be false. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
