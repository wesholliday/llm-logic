            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a logical contradiction. The statement \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\" implies that if the dreb was vroombed, then it was also spened. However, the statement \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\" implies that if the dreb was not spened, then it was not vroombed. This is a logical contradiction because if the dreb was not spened, then it was not vroombed, but the first statement implies that if the dreb was vroombed, then it was also spened. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
