In this case, the antecedent is \"If the twonk was plinked,\" and the consequent is \"then it was varnished.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked,\" we need to consider the truth values of the two statements. If the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true. However, if the consequent is false, then the antecedent may still be true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
