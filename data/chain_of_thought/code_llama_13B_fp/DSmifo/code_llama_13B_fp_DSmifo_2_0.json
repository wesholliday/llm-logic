In this case, the condition is that the book is not resting on the table.\n\nThe conclusion we can draw from this information is that the book is not resting on the table. However, we cannot infer that the book is on the shelf based solely on this information.\n\nThe reason for this is that the information does not provide any information about the book's location. The book could be resting on the table, or it could be on the shelf, or it could be somewhere else entirely.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the book is on the shelf based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
