The first statement suggests that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen, while the second statement implies that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room. This creates a logical contradiction, as it is impossible for the phone to be in both the kitchen and the living room at the same time. Therefore, we cannot infer that the phone is in the living room based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
