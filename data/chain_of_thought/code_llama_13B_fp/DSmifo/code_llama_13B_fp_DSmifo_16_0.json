Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag.\n\nTo infer that the pen is in my bag, we need to use the information in statement 2. This statement is a logical disjunction, which means that it is true if either of the two statements on either side of the 'or' is true.\n\nIn this case, the two statements are:\n\n1. The pen must be on my desk.\n2. The pen is in my bag.\n\nIf we assume that statement 1 is true, then we know that the pen is not on my desk. However, this does not necessarily mean that the pen is in my bag. It could be in any other location, such as on the floor or in a drawer.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the pen is in my bag based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
