This statement does not provide any information about whether Fido is inside or not.\n\nThe second statement, \"Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside,\" suggests that if Fido is not in the garden, then Fido must be inside. This statement implies that if Fido is not in the garden, then Fido is inside.\n\nHowever, the first statement does not provide any information about whether Fido is inside or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that Fido is inside based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
