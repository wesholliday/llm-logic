            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is in the form of a conditional sentence, \"If A, then B\", where A is \"The application must have been completed online\" and B is \"it must have included references\". The word \"and\" in the given statement is a conjunction, connecting two conditions that must be met. This implies that both conditions (being completed online and including references) are necessary for the statement to be true. Therefore, we can infer that both conditions must be met, and the statement can be rephrased as \"The application must have been completed online and included references\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
