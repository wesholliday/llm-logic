The key is to look for any patterns or relationships between the words. In this case, the words \"zibble\", \"blimple\", and \"quazzle\" seem to be related, possibly as a sequence of words that are similar in sound or structure. However, the word \"quank\" and \"snorkel\" and \"frozz\" seem to be unrelated to the first three words. \n\nThere is no clear pattern or relationship between the first three words and the last three words, so we cannot infer that the second statement is necessarily true based on the first statement. The words seem to be randomly connected, and there is no logical or grammatical link between the two statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
