The phrase \"in the quibble glorp\" is an additional location that is not mentioned in the original statement. To infer that the floob might be at both the flump blimp and in the quibble glorp, we would need additional information or a more specific statement that connects the two locations. However, based on the original statement alone, we cannot make this inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
