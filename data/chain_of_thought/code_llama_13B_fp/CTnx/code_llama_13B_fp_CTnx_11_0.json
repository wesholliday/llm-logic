In this case, the statement \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was not zimmed\" implies that if the flug was blummed, then it was not zimmed. However, the statement \"If the flug was zimmed, then the flug was not blummed\" implies that if the flug was zimmed, then it was not blummed.\n\nSince these two statements are contradictory, we cannot infer that \"If the flug was zimmed, then the flug was not blummed\" is true. In other words, we cannot infer that if the flug was zimmed, then it was not blummed.\n\nAnswer: No",
