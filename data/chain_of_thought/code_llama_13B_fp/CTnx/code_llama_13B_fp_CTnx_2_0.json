The statement \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint\" implies that if the wug was flooped, then it did not bim the zoint. However, the statement \"If the wug bimmed the zoint, then the wug was not flooped\" implies that if the wug bimmed the zoint, then it was not flooped.\n\nSince the two statements are contradictory, we cannot infer that \"If the wug bimmed the zoint, then the wug was not flooped\" from \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint\".\n\nAnswer: No",
