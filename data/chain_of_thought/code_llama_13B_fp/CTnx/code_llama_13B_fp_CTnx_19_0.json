The statement \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk did not plagged\" is a conditional statement that implies that if the smonk was vreebled, then it did not plagged. However, the statement \"If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled\" is also a conditional statement that implies that if the smonk plagged, then it was not vreebled.\n\nSince the two statements are contradictory, we cannot infer that \"If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled\" from \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk did not plagged\".\n\nAnswer: No",
