The statement \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg did not sproted the frink\" is a conditional statement that implies that if the sneg was crampled, then it did not sproted the frink. However, the statement \"If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled\" is also a conditional statement that implies that if the sneg sproted the frink, then it was not crampled.\n\nSince the two statements are contradictory, we cannot infer that \"If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled\" from \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg did not sproted the frink\".\n\nAnswer: No",
