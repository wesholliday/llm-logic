It is not a logical contradiction, but rather a statement that highlights the relationship between the two events.\n\nTo infer \"If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed,\" we would need to know more information about the relationship between the two events. For example, if we know that the splat quanking is a necessary condition for the splat to be morphed, then we can infer that if the splat quanked, then it was not morphed. However, if we do not have this information, then we cannot make this inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
