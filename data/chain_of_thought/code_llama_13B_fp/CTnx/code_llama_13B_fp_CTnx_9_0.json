This means that the twonk was not varnished, but it was also not plinked. This is a logical contradiction, as a thing cannot be both varnished and plinked at the same time.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the twonk was varnished, then it was not plinked. The given statement is a logical contradiction, and it does not provide any information about the relationship between the twonk and plinking.\n\nAnswer: no",
