The statement \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was not spened\" is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true. However, the antecedent is \"the dreb was vroombed,\" which is a contradiction because \"vroombed\" and \"spened\" are two different things. Therefore, the statement \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was not spened\" is always false, regardless of the truth or falsehood of the consequent (the part after the \"then\").\n\nAnswer: No",
