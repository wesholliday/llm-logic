The statement \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob did not movated\" is a logical contradiction because it is impossible for a flob to be both skizzled and movated at the same time.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the flob movated, then the flob was not skizzled\" from the given statement. The statement is always false, regardless of whether the flob movated or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
