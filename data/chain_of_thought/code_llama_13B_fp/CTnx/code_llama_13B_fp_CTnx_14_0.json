The statement \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug did not snugged\" is a conditional statement that implies that if the clug was fleeked, then it did not snugged. However, the statement \"If the clug snugged, then the clug was not fleeked\" is also a conditional statement that implies that if the clug snugged, then it was not fleeked.\n\nSince the two statements are contradictory, we cannot infer that \"If the clug snugged, then the clug was not fleeked\" from \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug did not snugged\".\n\nAnswer: No",
