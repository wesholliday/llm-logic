The statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled\" is a logical contradiction because it is impossible for a zinger to be both fraggled and smoogled at the same time.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
