The statement \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was not zargled\" is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true. However, the antecedent is \"the flugel was blimmed,\" which is a statement that is always false. Therefore, the statement \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was not zargled\" is always false, regardless of the truth or falsehood of the consequent (the part after the \"then\").\n\nAnswer: No",
