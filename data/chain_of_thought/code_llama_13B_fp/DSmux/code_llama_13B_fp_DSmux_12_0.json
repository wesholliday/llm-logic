It's not the case that the smip must be lupped.\n\nTo infer that the smip is shripped, we need to use the law of excluded middle, which states that for any proposition, either it is true or it is false. In this case, we can apply the law of excluded middle to the proposition \"the smip is shripped\" and conclude that either it is true or it is false.\n\nIf we assume that the smip is shripped, then we can use the first premise to conclude that either the smip is shripped or it must be lupped. Since we have already assumed that the smip is shripped, we can conclude that the smip must be lupped. This leads to a contradiction, since we have already assumed that the smip is shripped and the second premise states that it is not the case that the smip must be lupped.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the assumption that the smip is shripped leads to a contradiction, and we can infer that the smip is not shripped.\n\nAnswer: No",
