It's not the case that the twonk must be plinked.\n\nTo infer that the twonk is varnished, we need to use the information given in the first premise. The first premise states that either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked. This means that if the twonk is not varnished, it must be plinked.\n\nHowever, the second premise states that it's not the case that the twonk must be plinked. This means that the twonk is not plinked, which means that it must be varnished.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
