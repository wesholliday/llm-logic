It's not the case that the wug must be garpled.\n\nTo infer that the wug is sproinged, we need to use the information in the first statement to eliminate the possibility that the wug is garpled.\n\nThe first statement says that either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled. If the wug is garpled, then it cannot be sproinged. Therefore, if we assume that the wug is garpled, we can conclude that the first statement is false.\n\nHowever, the second statement says that it's not the case that the wug must be garpled. This means that the wug is not garpled. Therefore, we can conclude that the wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
