It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled.\n\nTo infer that the sprocket is cranked, we need to use the law of excluded middle, which states that for any proposition, either it is true or it is false. In this case, we can infer that the sprocket is cranked if we assume that the sprocket is not daggled.\n\nHowever, the second premise states that it is not the case that the sprocket must be daggled, which means that the sprocket is not necessarily daggled. Therefore, we cannot infer that the sprocket is cranked based solely on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
