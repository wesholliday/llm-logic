    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crastin, a nivet, and a jomial are the top bispets this breeding season. Breeders expect the crastin likely will birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, with the jomial birthing many fewer. These lead in birthing, so if the nivet doesn\u2019t birth the most offspring, then if the crastin doesn\u2019t, the jomial will. Moreover, the crastin likely will lead births and hence the nivet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the crastin doesn\u2019t lead births, the jomial will?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe reasoning behind this question is based on the assumption that the crastin is the most likely to lead births, followed by the nivet, and the jomial is the least likely to lead births. If the crastin does not lead births, then the nivet is likely to lead births, and if the nivet does not lead births, then the jomial is likely to lead births.\n\nHowever, the question asks whether it is likely that if the crastin does not lead births, the jomial will lead births. This is not necessarily true, as the jomial may not lead births even if the crastin does not lead births.\n\nAnswer: No",
