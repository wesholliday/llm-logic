    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect are applying for one open zulision. The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

If the cramen doesn't get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn't, the sulect will. This is because the sulect is the last remaining applicant.\n\nHowever, this reasoning is not necessarily true. It is possible that the jantiz may not get the zulision even if the cramen does not get it. This is because the jantiz may have weaker qualifications than the cramen, but still be more qualified than the sulect.\n\nTherefore, it is not necessarily true that if the jantiz doesn't get the zulision, the sulect will. The answer is no.",
