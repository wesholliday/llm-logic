    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a blimfet, a crongle, and a narzil are the leading bafwidgers. Experts expect the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most this year, followed by the crongle, with the narzil bafwidging much less. These are the only major bafwidgers, so if the crongle doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, then if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will bafwidge the most. Moreover, the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most, and hence the crongle likely won\u2019t bafwidge the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe reasoning behind this question is based on the assumption that the blimfet, crongle, and narzil are the only major bafwidgers, and that the crongle is likely to bafwidge the most. The question then asks whether it follows that, if the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, the narzil will.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the relationships between the three bafwidgers. If the crongle is likely to bafwidge the most, then it is likely that the blimfet will bafwidge the most, and hence the narzil will bafwidge the least. Therefore, if the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, it is likely that the narzil will bafwidge the most.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
