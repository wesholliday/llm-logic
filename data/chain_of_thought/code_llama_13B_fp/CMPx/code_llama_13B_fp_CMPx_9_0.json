    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a vringel, a nastil, and a joncul are shortlisted for this year\u2019s Luggleton Prize. The vringel is regarded as the most likely winner, followed by the nastil, while the joncul is considered a significant underdog. Since these are the only finalists, if the nastil doesn\u2019t win the prize, then if the vringel doesn\u2019t win, the joncul will win. Moreover, the vringel likely will win the prize and hence the nastil likely won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the vringel doesn\u2019t win the prize, the joncul will?",
