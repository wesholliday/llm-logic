    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a dasetil, a lentum, and a vifali are competing to be this year's batalit. The dasetil is the most likely to become the batalit, followed closely by the lentum, with the vifali trailing way behind. Since these are the only competitors, if the lentum isn\u2019t the batalit, then if the dasetil isn\u2019t the batalit, the vifali will be. Since the dasetil is ahead, the lentum most likely won\u2019t be the batalit. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the dasetil isn\u2019t the batalit, the vifali will be?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe reasoning behind this question is based on the assumption that the dasetil is the most likely to become the batalit, followed closely by the lentum, and the vifali is trailing behind. If the lentum is not the batalit, then it follows that if the dasetil is not the batalit, the vifali will be. This is because the dasetil is ahead of the lentum, so if the lentum is not the batalit, it means that the dasetil is the most likely candidate to become the batalit. Therefore, if the dasetil is not the batalit, it means that the vifali is the most likely candidate to become the batalit.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
