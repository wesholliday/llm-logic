    "user_prompt": "Suppose a flinker, a dringen, and a n\u00fcffen have the best projections to have a breakout season next year. Talent scouts believe it's highly probable the flinker will have a breakout season, followed closely by the dringen, while the n\u00fcffen is an outside shot. Since these are the only top prospects, if the dringen doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season. Moreover, scouts think the flinker will likely have a breakout season and hence the dringen likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will?",

The scouts believe that the flinker will likely have a breakout season, followed closely by the dringen, while the n\u00fcffen is an outside shot.\n\nThe question then asks if it follows that if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will. This is a logical conclusion based on the assumption that if the dringen doesn't have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season.\n\nHowever, this conclusion is not necessarily true. It is possible that the flinker and dringen both have breakout seasons, in which case the n\u00fcffen would not have a breakout season. Therefore, the answer to the question is no.",
