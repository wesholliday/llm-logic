    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crinel, a nafiz, and a tomul are competing to be snarggle of next year's laggle team. The crinel is considered the frontrunner for snarggle, followed by the nafiz, while the tomul is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates, if the nafiz isn\u2019t named snarggle, then if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle. Moreover, the crinel likely will be named snarggle and hence the nafiz likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be?",

This means that if the nafiz is not named snarggle, then if the crinel is not named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that it is likely that if the crinel is not named snarggle, the tomul will be. The likelihood of the tomul being named snarggle depends on the specific circumstances and the preferences of the selection committee.\n\nAnswer: No",
