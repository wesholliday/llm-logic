    "user_prompt": "Suppose a stribben, a vanoon, and a jentapp are applying to rent a bondle. The owner thinks the stribben is the strongest applicant, followed by the vanoon, while the jentapp seems much less qualified to rent a bondle. Since these are the only applicants, if the vanoon isn\u2019t selected, then if the stribben isn\u2019t selected, the jentapp will be selected. Moreover, the stribben likely will be chosen and hence the vanoon likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the stribben isn\u2019t selected to rent the bondle, the jentapp will be?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe reasoning behind this question is based on the idea that the owner of the bondle has a certain level of bias towards the stribben, and that the vanoon is not as qualified as the stribben. However, the jentapp is the only other applicant, and if the vanoon is not selected, then the jentapp will be selected. This means that if the stribben is not selected, the jentapp will be selected.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
