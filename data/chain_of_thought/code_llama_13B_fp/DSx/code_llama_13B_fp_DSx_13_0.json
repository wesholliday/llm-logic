This means that the glip is either in a state of being slogged or in a state of being tragged.\n\nThe second statement, 'The glip is not tragged,' tells us that the glip is not in a state of being tragged. This means that the glip is either slogged or not slogged.\n\nNow, we can use the information from the first statement and the second statement to determine whether we can infer 'The glip is slogged.'\n\nIf the glip is not tragged, then it must be slogged. Therefore, we can infer that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
