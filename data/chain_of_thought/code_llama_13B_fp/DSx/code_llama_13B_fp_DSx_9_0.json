The twonk is not plinked.\n\nTo infer that the twonk is varnished, we need to analyze the given information and determine whether it is logically consistent.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first premise: \"Either the twonk is plinked or it is varnished.\" This means that either the twonk is plinked or it is varnished, but not both.\n\nNext, let's consider the second premise: \"The twonk is not plinked.\" This means that the twonk is not plinked, which means that it is not plinked or varnished.\n\nNow, let's apply the principle of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time. In this case, we have two statements:\n\n1. The twonk is either plinked or varnished.\n2. The twonk is not plinked.\n\nIf we combine these two statements, we get:\n\n1. The twonk is either plinked or varnished.\n2. The twonk is not plinked.\n\nThis means that the twonk cannot be both plinked and varnished at the same time. Therefore, we can conclude that the twonk is either plinked or varnished, but not both.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion: \"The twonk is varnished.\" This means that the twonk is varnished, which means that it is not plinked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the twonk is varnished based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
