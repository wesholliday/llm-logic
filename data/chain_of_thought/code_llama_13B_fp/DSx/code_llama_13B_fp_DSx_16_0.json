If the sneg is crampled, then the statement 'The sneg is crampled' is true, and if the sneg is sproted, then the statement 'The sneg is sproted' is true.\n\nOn the other hand, 'The sneg is not sproted' is a negation, which means that the statement 'The sneg is sproted' is false.\n\nNow, we can use the principle of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time. If we assume that 'The sneg is crampled', then we can conclude that 'The sneg is not sproted', which contradicts the assumption. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The sneg is crampled' from 'Either the sneg is crampled or it is sproted' together with 'The sneg is not sproted'.\n\nAnswer: no",
