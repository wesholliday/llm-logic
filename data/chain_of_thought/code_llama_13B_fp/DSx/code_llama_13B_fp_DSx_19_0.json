If the smonk is vreebled, then the statement 'The smonk is vreebled' is true, and if the smonk is plagged, then the statement 'The smonk is plagged' is true.\n\nOn the other hand, 'The smonk is not plagged' is a negation, which means that the statement 'The smonk is plagged' is false.\n\nNow, we can use the principle of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time. If we assume that 'The smonk is vreebled', then we can conclude that 'The smonk is not plagged' is false, which contradicts the fact that 'The smonk is not plagged'. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The smonk is vreebled' from 'Either the smonk is vreebled or it is plagged' together with 'The smonk is not plagged'.\n\nAnswer: No",
