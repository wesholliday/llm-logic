This is a direct inference from the statement. However, the statement does not provide any information about whether the restaurant was open on other days or for limited hours. It only specifies that it was closed on Mondays. Therefore, we cannot infer that the restaurant was open for limited hours or closed on Mondays from the original statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
