The phrase \"semi-formal or formal\" is a broader category that includes both formal and semi-formal events. Since \"formal\" is a subset of \"semi-formal or formal\", we can infer that if an event is formal, it must also be semi-formal or formal. However, we cannot infer the opposite, that is, if an event is semi-formal or formal, we cannot conclude that it must be formal. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
