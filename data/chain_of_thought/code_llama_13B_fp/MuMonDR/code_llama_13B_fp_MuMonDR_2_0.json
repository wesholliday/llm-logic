The statement 'The book must be on the shelf' implies that the book is currently located on a shelf, but it doesn't provide any information about the book's location outside of that specific shelf. It doesn't mention the library at all. Therefore, we cannot assume that the book is in the library just because it's on the shelf. The shelf could be anywhere, not necessarily within a library.\n\nAnswer: no"
