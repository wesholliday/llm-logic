The original statement, 'The exam must have been difficult', is a specific claim about the nature of the exam. To infer a more general statement, we need to consider whether the original statement provides enough information to support a broader conclusion.\n\nIn this case, the original statement only mentions that the exam was difficult, without providing any information about the exam being easy. Therefore, we cannot infer that the exam must have been easy or difficult, as the original statement only provides evidence for one of these possibilities.\n\nAnswer: no"
