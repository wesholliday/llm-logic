            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The project must have been completed by Friday' implies that the project was finished by Friday, with no mention of any extension. However, the statement 'The project must have been extended or completed by Friday' suggests that the project might have been extended beyond the original deadline, but still finished by Friday. The key difference lies in the word 'extended', which introduces the possibility of the project being delayed, but still meeting the deadline. Since the original statement does not provide any information about the project being extended, we cannot infer that it must have been extended.\n\nAnswer: no"
