This means that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake.\n\nThe second statement, 'The vampire was awake,' provides additional information about the vampire's state.\n\nBased on the information provided, we can infer that the vampire is awake, but we cannot infer that the mummy is also awake. The causal relationship between the vampire and the mummy only implies that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake, but it does not guarantee that the mummy is awake.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'no'. We cannot infer that the mummy was awake based on the given information.",
