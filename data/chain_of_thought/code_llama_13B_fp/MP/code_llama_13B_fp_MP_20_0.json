            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe question is asking whether we can infer that the banana was yellow based on the fact that the apple was red and the statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the premise (the apple was red) is true.\n\nIn this case, the premise is true, since we know that the apple was red. Therefore, we can infer that the banana was yellow based on the conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
