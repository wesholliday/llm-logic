However, this implication does not necessarily mean that the truck was metal.\n\nThe reason for this is that the implication is based on the assumption that the doll was plastic, but this assumption is not explicitly stated in the question. Therefore, we cannot infer that the truck was metal based solely on the implication.\n\nAnswer: No",
