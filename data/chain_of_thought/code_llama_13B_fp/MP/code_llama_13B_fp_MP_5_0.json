            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'Amy played tennis' from 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis' together with 'Jeff played basketball', we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement, 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis', is a conditional statement. It means that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. This statement is a logical implication, which means that if the antecedent (the part before the 'then') is true, then the consequent (the part after the 'then') must also be true.\n\nThe second statement, 'Jeff played basketball', is a fact. It is a statement that is true by definition.\n\nNow, we can use the logical rules of inference to determine whether we can infer 'Amy played tennis' from the two statements.\n\n1. Modus ponens: If we know that the antecedent of a conditional statement is true, and we know that the consequent of the same statement is also true, then we can infer that the conditional statement is true.\n2. Modus tollens: If we know that the consequent of a conditional statement is false, and we know that the antecedent of the same statement is true, then we can infer that the antecedent of the same statement is false.\n\nIn this case, we can use modus ponens to infer that 'Amy played tennis' is true, because we know that 'Jeff played basketball' is true, and we know that 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis' is true. Therefore, we can infer that 'Amy played tennis' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
