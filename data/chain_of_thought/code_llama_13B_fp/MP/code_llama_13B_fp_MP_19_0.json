It means that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. This statement is a logical consequence of the second statement, 'Tom watched football'.\n\nTherefore, if we know that Tom watched football, we can infer that Jen watched basketball. This is because the first statement is a logical consequence of the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
