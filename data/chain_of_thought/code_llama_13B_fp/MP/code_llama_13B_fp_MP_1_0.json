            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'Sue was at the wedding' from 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' together with 'Mary was at the wedding', we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement, 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', is a conditional statement. It states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. This means that if we know that Mary was at the wedding, we can conclude that Sue was also at the wedding.\n\nThe second statement, 'Mary was at the wedding', is a fact. It states that Mary was indeed at the wedding.\n\nNow, we can use the conditional statement to draw a conclusion about Sue's presence at the wedding. If we know that Mary was at the wedding, then we can conclude that Sue was also at the wedding. Therefore, we can infer that Sue was at the wedding based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: yes",
