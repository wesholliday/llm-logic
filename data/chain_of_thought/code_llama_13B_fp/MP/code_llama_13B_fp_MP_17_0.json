The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the condition (Ben ate pasta) is met. In this case, the condition is met, so the conclusion (Kate ate the salad) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that Kate ate the salad.\n\nAnswer: yes",
