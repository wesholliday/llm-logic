The argument is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement of the form \"if P, then Q.\" In this case, the premise is \"Joe went to the park,\" and the conclusion is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nThe question is whether we can infer the conclusion from the premise. To do this, we need to determine whether the premise is sufficient to entail the conclusion. In other words, we need to determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nThe premise \"Joe went to the park\" is a statement of fact, and it does not provide any information about whether Lucy went to the zoo. Therefore, we cannot infer the conclusion \"Lucy went to the zoo\" from the premise alone.\n\nAnswer: No",
