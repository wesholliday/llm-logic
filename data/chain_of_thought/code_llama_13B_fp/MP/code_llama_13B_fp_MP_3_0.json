It states that if a certain condition (in this case, the book being written by James) is true, then a certain conclusion (the book being a mystery novel) will also be true.\n\nThe second statement, 'The book was written by James', is a factual statement. It states that the book was indeed written by James.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether we can infer 'The book is a mystery novel' from the two statements. To do this, we need to consider whether the first statement is a sufficient condition for the second statement to be true.\n\nIn other words, we need to determine whether the fact that the book was written by James is a sufficient condition for the book to be a mystery novel.\n\nIf we assume that the first statement is a sufficient condition, then we can infer 'The book is a mystery novel' from the two statements. This is because the first statement states that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. Since we know that the book was written by James, we can conclude that it is a mystery novel.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the first statement is not a sufficient condition, then we cannot infer 'The book is a mystery novel' from the two statements. This is because the first statement only states that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel, but it does not provide any other information about the book.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The book is a mystery novel' from 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' together with 'The book was written by James' without further information.\n\nAnswer: No",
