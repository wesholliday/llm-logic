This is a classic example of a disjunctive syllogism, where we have a list of mutually exclusive possibilities. Since \"zibber might be zazzle zizz zibber\" is one of the options, and \"blurble\" is another option, we can infer that the zibber might indeed be blurble, as it is a separate and distinct possibility from the first option.\n\nAnswer: yes"
