The word \"or\" is used to indicate that the statement is true if either of the alternatives is true. In this case, the statement is saying that the flim might be either plonk or zooble, but not necessarily both. This means that we can infer that the flim might be zooble, because the statement explicitly includes zooble as one of the possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes"
