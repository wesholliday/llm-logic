            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement, where \"The fribble might be in the blurble\" is the condition, and \"or on the wumble\" is the consequence. This means that if the fribble is in the blurble, then it might also be on the wumble. However, it does not necessarily mean that if the fribble is on the wumble, it must be in the blurble. The statement does not provide any information about the relationship between the fribble being on the wumble and the fribble being in the blurble. Therefore, we can infer that the fribble might be on the wumble, but we cannot infer that the fribble is on the wumble.\n\nAnswer: yes"
