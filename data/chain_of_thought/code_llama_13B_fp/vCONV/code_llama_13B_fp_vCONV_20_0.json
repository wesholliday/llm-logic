            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise. In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. In this case, the premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. The conclusion states that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\n\nThe problem with this argument is that the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise. Just because the apple was red does not mean that the banana was yellow. In fact, it is possible for the apple to be red and the banana to be green. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
