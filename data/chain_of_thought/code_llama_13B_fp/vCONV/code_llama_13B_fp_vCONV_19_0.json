In this case, the premise is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball', and the conclusion is 'If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football'.\n\nThe reasoning behind this argument is that if Tom watched football, then it is likely that Jen also watched basketball, as they are both interested in the same sport. Therefore, if Jen watched basketball, it can be inferred that Tom also watched football.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
