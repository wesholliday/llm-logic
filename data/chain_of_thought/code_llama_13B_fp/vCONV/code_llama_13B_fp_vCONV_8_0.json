In this case, the premise is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake,\" and the conclusion is \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake.\"\n\nThe argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premise. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake, and if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
