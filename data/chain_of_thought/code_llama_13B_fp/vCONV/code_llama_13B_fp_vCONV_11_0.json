In this case, the conclusion is \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate,\" and the premise is \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. In this case, the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premise. If the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
