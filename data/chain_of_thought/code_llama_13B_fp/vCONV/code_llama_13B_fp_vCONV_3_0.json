The premise states that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. The conclusion states that if the book is a mystery novel, then it was written by James. This creates a logical contradiction, as the conclusion implies that the book was written by James, which is the same as the premise. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
