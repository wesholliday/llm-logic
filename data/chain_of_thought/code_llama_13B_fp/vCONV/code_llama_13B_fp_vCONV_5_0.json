            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion follows from the premise. In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premise and conclusion and determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nThe premise of the argument is 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis'. This means that if Jeff played basketball, then it is necessarily true that Amy played tennis.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is 'If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball'. This means that if Amy played tennis, then it is necessarily true that Jeff played basketball.\n\nNow, let's examine the premise and conclusion of the argument:\n\nPremise: If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\nConclusion: If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premise if the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premise. In other words, if the conclusion is true, then the premise must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the conclusion is true if the premise is true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
