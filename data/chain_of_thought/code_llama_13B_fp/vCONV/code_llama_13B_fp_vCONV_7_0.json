The conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nThe argument is in the form of a syllogism, which is a type of argument that consists of three parts: a major premise, a minor premise, and a conclusion. In this case, the major premise is 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race', and the minor premise is 'If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race'. The conclusion is 'If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race'.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it follows the rules of syllogistic reasoning. The conclusion follows logically from the premises, and there is no logical flaw in the argument.\n\nAnswer: yes",
