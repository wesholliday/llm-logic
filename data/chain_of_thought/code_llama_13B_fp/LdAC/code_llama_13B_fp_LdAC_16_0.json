            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can logically deduce 'The shirt was cotton' from 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim' together with 'The pants were denim', we need to evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\nThe argument is based on the conditional statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'. This statement is a logical implication, which means that if the premise (the shirt was cotton) is true, then the conclusion (the pants were denim) must also be true.\n\nHowever, the argument also includes the premise 'The pants were denim', which is not necessarily related to the shirt. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce 'The shirt was cotton' from the argument.\n\nAnswer: No",
