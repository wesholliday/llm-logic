            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo logically deduce 'The dog was inside' from 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside' together with 'The cat was outside', we need to use the principle of conditional proof. This means that we need to show that the conclusion of the conditional statement ('The dog was inside') follows logically from the premises.\n\nIn this case, the premises are 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside' and 'The cat was outside'. We can use the law of excluded middle to deduce that either the dog was inside or the dog was outside. If the dog was inside, then the cat would be outside, which is not the case. Therefore, we can conclude that the dog was outside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
