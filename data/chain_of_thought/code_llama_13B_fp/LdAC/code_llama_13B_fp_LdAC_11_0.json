'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' means that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would also be blueberry. 'The muffins were blueberry' means that the muffins were indeed blueberry.\n\nNow, let's apply the reasoning. If we assume that the cake was chocolate, then we can deduce that the muffins were blueberry. However, we are given that the muffins were indeed blueberry. Therefore, we can conclude that the cake was chocolate.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
