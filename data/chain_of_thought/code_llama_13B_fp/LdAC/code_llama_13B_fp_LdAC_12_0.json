This means that we need to use the information provided to make a conclusion that is logically consistent with the information given.\n\nIn this case, we are given two statements:\n\n1. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n2. Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nWe can use the first statement to deduce that Joe went to the park, because the statement says that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. Since Lucy went to the zoo, we can conclude that Joe went to the park.\n\nTherefore, we can logically deduce 'Joe went to the park' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
