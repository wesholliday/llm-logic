This law states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time.\n\nIn this case, we have two statements: 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' and 'Chris finished the race'. If we assume that 'Alex finished the race' is true, then we can use the first statement to deduce that 'Chris finished the race' must also be true. However, we are also given that 'Chris finished the race', which contradicts the assumption that 'Alex finished the race' is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce 'Alex finished the race' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
