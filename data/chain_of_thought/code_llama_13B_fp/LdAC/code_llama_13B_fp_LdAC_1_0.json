            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo logically deduce 'Mary was at the wedding' from 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' together with 'Sue was at the wedding', we need to use the principle of modus ponens. Modus ponens states that if we have a statement of the form 'if P, then Q' and we know that P is true, then we can deduce that Q is also true.\n\nIn this case, we have the statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' and we know that Sue was at the wedding. Therefore, we can apply modus ponens to deduce that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
