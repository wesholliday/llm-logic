This means that we can only draw conclusions that are logically implied by the given information.\n\nIn this case, we are given two statements:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n2. Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can deduce that Lisa bought the red shirt. This is because the first statement implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. Since we know that Mark bought the blue shirt, we can conclude that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes, we can logically deduce 'Lisa bought the red shirt' from the given information.",
