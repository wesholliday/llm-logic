            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe question is asking whether we can logically deduce 'The apple was red' from the given information. The information given is 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' and 'The banana was yellow'.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the 'then') is true. In this case, the antecedent is 'The apple was red', and the consequent is 'The banana was yellow'.\n\nThe second statement is a simple statement of fact, which means that it is always true regardless of the truth of the antecedent. In this case, the statement is 'The banana was yellow'.\n\nNow, we need to consider whether the second statement is sufficient to deduce the truth of the first statement. If the second statement is true, then it is possible that the antecedent (the apple was red) is false. In other words, the second statement does not provide any information about the color of the apple. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce 'The apple was red' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
