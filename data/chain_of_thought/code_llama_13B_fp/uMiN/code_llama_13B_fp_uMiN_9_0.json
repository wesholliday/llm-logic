However, it does not necessarily mean that it is not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\n\nIn order to determine whether or not we can infer that it's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt, we need to consider the context in which the statement was made. If the statement was made in a situation where it is known that Lisa did in fact buy the red shirt, then we can infer that it is not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt. However, if the statement was made in a situation where it is not known whether or not Lisa bought the red shirt, then we cannot infer that it is not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: No",
