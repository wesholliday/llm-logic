However, this does not necessarily mean that it is not the case that the book must have been written by James.\n\nFor example, if we know that the book was written by someone else, then it is not the case that the book must have been written by James. In this case, the statement \"The book might not have been written by James\" is true, but it does not necessarily mean that the book must have been written by someone else.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is \"no\", we cannot infer that it's not the case that the book must have been written by James.",
