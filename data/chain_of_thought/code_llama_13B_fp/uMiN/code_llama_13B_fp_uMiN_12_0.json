However, it does not necessarily mean that it is not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair.\n\nIn other words, the statement does not provide enough information to determine whether or not the jacket must be draped over the chair. Therefore, we cannot infer that it is not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: no",
