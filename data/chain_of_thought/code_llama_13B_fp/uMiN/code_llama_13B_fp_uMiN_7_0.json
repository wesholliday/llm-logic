However, it does not necessarily mean that it is not the case that Alex must have finished the race.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that it's not the case that Alex must have finished the race, we need to consider the context in which the statement was made. If the speaker is certain that Alex did not finish the race, then we can infer that it is not the case that Alex must have finished the race. However, if the speaker is unsure or uncertain about whether Alex finished the race, then we cannot infer that it is not the case that Alex must have finished the race.\n\nAnswer: No",
