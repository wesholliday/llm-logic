However, it does not necessarily mean that it is not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\n\nThere are several reasons why we cannot infer that it is not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza:\n\n1. The statement \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" does not provide any information about Sue's preferences or choices. It only states that there is a possibility that she did not choose pizza.\n2. The statement does not rule out the possibility that Sue chose something else. It only states that there is a possibility that she did not choose pizza.\n3. The statement does not provide any information about the context in which the choice was made. It does not indicate whether Sue was in a situation where she had to choose between pizza and something else, or whether she had the option to choose between pizza and something else.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that it is not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza based on the statement \"Sue might not have chosen pizza.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
