However, this does not necessarily mean that it is not the case that the alien must have visited Mars.\n\nFor example, if we know that the alien visited Earth, then it is not the case that the alien must have visited Mars. However, it is still possible that the alien visited Mars, and we cannot infer that it did not visit Mars based on the fact that it visited Earth.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
