This statement is not the same as saying that the griffin must have been in the forest, which would be a positive statement.\n\nTo infer that the griffin must have been in the forest, we would need more information or evidence. For example, if we knew that the griffin was known to live in the forest, we could infer that it must have been in the forest. However, without any additional information, we cannot infer that the griffin must have been in the forest.\n\nAnswer: No",
