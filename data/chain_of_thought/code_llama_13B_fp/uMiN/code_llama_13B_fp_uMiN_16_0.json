However, the statement \"The pen must be in my bag\" is a positive statement, which means that it is the case that the pen is in my bag.\n\nTo infer that the pen must not be in my bag, we would need to know more information about the situation. For example, if we know that the pen is not in my bag, then we can infer that it must not be in my bag. However, if we only know that the pen might not be in my bag, then we cannot infer that it must not be in my bag.\n\nAnswer: No",
