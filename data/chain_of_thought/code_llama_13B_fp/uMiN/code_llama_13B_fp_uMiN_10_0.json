However, this statement does not necessarily imply that it is not the case that the dog must have been inside.\n\nFor example, if we know that the dog was not inside the house at a certain time, but we do not know whether it was inside or outside at other times, then we cannot infer that it must have been inside.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no",
