            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is 'The unicorn was in the forest', and the premises are 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest' and 'The griffin was in the forest'.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the validity of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement of the form 'if P, then Q'. In this case, the premise is 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest'.\n2. The second premise is a statement of the form 'P'. In this case, the premise is 'The griffin was in the forest'.\n3. The conclusion is a statement of the form 'Q'. In this case, the conclusion is 'The unicorn was in the forest'.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion logically follows from the premises if the griffin was in the forest, because the first premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
