In this case, the conclusion 'Kate ate salad' logically follows from the premise 'Ben ate pasta' and the premise 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad'.\n\nThe first premise states that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. This means that if Ben ate pasta, then it is necessarily true that Kate ate salad.\n\nThe second premise states that Ben ate pasta. This means that it is necessarily true that Ben ate pasta.\n\nTherefore, by modus ponens, the conclusion 'Kate ate salad' logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
