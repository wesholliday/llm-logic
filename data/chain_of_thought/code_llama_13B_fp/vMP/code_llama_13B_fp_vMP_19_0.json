In this case, the conclusion is 'Jen watched basketball', and the premises are 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' and 'Tom watched football'.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. In this case, the first premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the 'then') is true. The antecedent in this case is 'Tom watched football', which is the second premise.\n\nIf the second premise is true, then the first premise is also true, and the conclusion follows logically. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
