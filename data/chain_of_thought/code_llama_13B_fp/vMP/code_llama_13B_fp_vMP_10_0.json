            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is 'The cat was outside' and the premises are 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside' and 'The dog was inside'.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the validity of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. The first premise, 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside', is a conditional statement. This means that the conclusion, 'The cat was outside', logically follows from the premise if the antecedent (the part before the 'then') is true.\n2. The second premise, 'The dog was inside', is a statement of fact. This means that the premise is true regardless of whether the conclusion is true or not.\n3. The conclusion, 'The cat was outside', is also a statement of fact. This means that the conclusion is true regardless of whether the premises are true or not.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
