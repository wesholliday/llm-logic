            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is 'Mark bought the blue shirt', and the premises are 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' and 'Lisa bought the red shirt'.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the validity of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement of the form 'if P, then Q'. In this case, the premise is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n2. The second premise is a statement of the form 'P'. In this case, the premise is 'Lisa bought the red shirt'.\n3. The conclusion is a statement of the form 'Q'. In this case, the conclusion is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion logically follows from the premises if we can establish that the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises.\n\nTo establish that the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises, we need to show that the conclusion is a logical implication of the premises. In other words, we need to show that the conclusion is a statement of the form 'if P, then Q', where P is the first premise and Q is the conclusion.\n\nIn this case, the conclusion is a logical implication of the premises if we can establish that the conclusion is a statement of the form 'if P, then Q', where P is the first premise and Q is the conclusion.\n\nTo establish this, we need to examine the structure of the argument. The argument is structured as follows:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n2. Lisa bought the red shirt.\n3. Therefore, Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nThe argument is structured as a conditional argument, where the first premise is a conditional statement, the second premise is a statement of the form 'P', and the conclusion is a statement of the form 'Q'.\n\nIn this case, the conclusion is a logical implication of the premises if we can establish that the conclusion is a statement of the form 'if P, then Q', where P is the first premise and Q is the conclusion.\n\nTo establish this, we need to examine the structure of the argument. The argument is structured as follows:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n2. Lisa bought the red shirt.\n3.
