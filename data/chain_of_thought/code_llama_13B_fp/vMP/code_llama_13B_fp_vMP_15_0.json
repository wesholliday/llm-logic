            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is 'Erin took a train', and the premises are 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' and 'Sam took a plane'.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. In this case, the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. This means that if Sam took a plane, then it is necessarily true that Erin took a train.\n\nThe second premise states that Sam took a plane. This means that it is necessarily true that Sam took a plane.\n\nTherefore, by modus ponens, we can conclude that it is necessarily true that Erin took a train. This means that the conclusion 'Erin took a train' logically follows from the premises 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' and 'Sam took a plane'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
