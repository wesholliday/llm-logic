            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is 'The banana was yellow' and the premises are 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' and 'The apple was red'.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. In this case, the conclusion logically follows from the premises if the implication in the first premise is true.\n\nThe implication in the first premise is 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'. This means that if the apple was red, then the banana must be yellow. If the apple was not red, then the implication is not true, and the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid if the apple was red. If the apple was not red, then the implication is not true, and the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
