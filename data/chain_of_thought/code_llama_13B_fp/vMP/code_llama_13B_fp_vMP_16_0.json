            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is \"The pants were denim\" and the premises are \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" and \"The shirt was cotton.\"\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the validity of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. The first premise \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is a conditional statement. This means that the conclusion \"The pants were denim\" logically follows from the premise if the antecedent (the part of the conditional statement before the \"then\") is true.\n2. The second premise \"The shirt was cotton\" is a statement of fact. This means that the premise is true regardless of whether the conclusion is true or not.\n3. The conclusion \"The pants were denim\" is also a statement of fact. This means that the conclusion is true regardless of whether the premises are true or not.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can determine that the argument is logically valid. The conclusion logically follows from the premises, and the premises are true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
