In this case, the conclusion is \"The muffins were blueberry\" and the premises are \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" and \"The cake was chocolate\".\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. In this case, the conclusion logically follows from the premises because the first premise states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. Since the second premise states that the cake was chocolate, we can conclude that the muffins were blueberry.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
