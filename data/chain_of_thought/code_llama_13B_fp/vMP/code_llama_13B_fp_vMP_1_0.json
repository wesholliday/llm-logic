            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it is a form of modus ponens, which is a valid logical inference. Modus ponens states that if a conclusion follows from a premise and a premise is true, then the conclusion is also true. In this case, the first premise is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', which is a conditional statement. The second premise is 'Mary was at the wedding', which is a statement of fact. The conclusion is 'Sue was at the wedding', which is a statement of fact.\n\nIf the first premise is true and the second premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
