            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is 'Chris finished the race', and the premises are 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' and 'Alex finished the race'.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the validity of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. The first premise, 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race', is a conditional statement. This means that the conclusion follows from the premise if the antecedent (the part before the 'then') is true. In this case, the antecedent is 'Alex finished the race', and the conclusion is 'Chris finished the race'.\n2. The second premise, 'Alex finished the race', is a statement of fact. This means that it is true or false, but it does not necessarily imply anything about the conclusion.\n3. The conclusion, 'Chris finished the race', is also a statement of fact.\n\nNow, let's examine the validity of the argument:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that the conclusion follows from the premise if the antecedent is true.\n2. The second premise is a statement of fact, which means that it is true or false, but it does not necessarily imply anything about the conclusion.\n3. The conclusion is a statement of fact, which means that it is true or false, but it does not necessarily imply anything about the premises.\n\nSince the conclusion follows from the premises, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
