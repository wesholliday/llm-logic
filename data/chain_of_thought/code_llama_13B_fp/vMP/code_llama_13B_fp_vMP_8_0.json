            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is \"The mummy was awake\" and the premises are \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" and \"The vampire was awake.\"\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the validity of each premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. The first premise \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is a conditional statement. This means that the premise is logically valid if the conclusion \"The mummy was awake\" logically follows from the premise \"The vampire was awake.\"\n2. The second premise \"The vampire was awake\" is a statement of fact. This means that the premise is logically valid if it is true.\n3. The conclusion \"The mummy was awake\" is a statement of fact. This means that the conclusion is logically valid if it is true.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the validity of each premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. The first premise \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is logically valid because the conclusion \"The mummy was awake\" logically follows from the premise \"The vampire was awake.\"\n2. The second premise \"The vampire was awake\" is logically valid because it is a statement of fact that is true.\n3. The conclusion \"The mummy was awake\" is logically valid because it is a statement of fact that is true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
