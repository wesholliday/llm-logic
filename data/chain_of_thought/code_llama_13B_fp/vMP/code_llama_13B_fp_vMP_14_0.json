            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is 'The wolf was in the den', and the premises are 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den' and 'The bear was in the cave'.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the validity of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement of the form 'if P, then Q'. In this case, the premise is 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den'.\n2. The second premise is a statement of the form 'P'. In this case, the premise is 'The bear was in the cave'.\n3. The conclusion is a statement of the form 'Q'. In this case, the conclusion is 'The wolf was in the den'.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion logically follows from the premises if the bear was in the cave, because the first premise states that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. Therefore, the conclusion is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
