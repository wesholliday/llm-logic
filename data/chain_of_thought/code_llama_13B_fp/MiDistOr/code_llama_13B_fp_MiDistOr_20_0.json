            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The event might be formal or semi-formal\" implies that the event has two possible scenarios: it could be formal or it could be semi-formal. The word \"or\" is used to indicate an alternative, suggesting that the event is not necessarily one or the other, but rather it could be either one. This is a classic example of a disjunctive statement, where two possibilities are presented as mutually exclusive alternatives. Therefore, we can logically infer that the event might be formal or it might be semi-formal.\n\nAnswer: yes"
