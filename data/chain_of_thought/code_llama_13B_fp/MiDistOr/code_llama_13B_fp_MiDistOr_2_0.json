            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The book might be on the shelf or in the library\" is a disjunction, which means it presents two possibilities: the book is either on the shelf or in the library. The word \"or\" is used to indicate that these are mutually exclusive options. The statement does not imply that the book might be in both places at the same time. Therefore, we can infer that the book might be on the shelf or it might be in the library, but it cannot be both.\n\nAnswer: yes"
