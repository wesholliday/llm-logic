The phrase \"or\" is used to indicate that one or the other (or both) of the options can be true. In this case, the statement \"The application might be completed online or in person\" is saying that there are two possible ways to complete the application: online or in person. The statement is not saying that the application can be completed in both ways simultaneously, but rather that it can be completed in one of the two ways. Therefore, we can infer that the application might be completed online or it might be completed in person.\n\nAnswer: yes"
