The use of \"or\" suggests an exclusive disjunction, meaning that the document is in one of two states: either it is signed, or it is notarized, but not both. This is different from saying \"The document might be signed or it might be notarized\", which would imply that the document could be in either state, including both signed and notarized.\n\nAnswer: no"
