The premise states that if you get enough sleep, you won't be tired, which is a correct statement. The conclusion states that if you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired, which is also a correct statement.\n\nThe conclusion follows logically from the premise because the addition of hard labor to the premise does not change the fact that getting enough sleep is necessary for not being tired. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
