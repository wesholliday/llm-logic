            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise. In other words, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premise and conclusion and determine whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nThe premise is 'If I water the plants, they will grow.' This statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that is only true if a certain condition is met. In this case, the condition is that the plants are watered.\n\nThe conclusion is 'If I water the plants and there is no sunlight, they will grow.' This statement is also a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that is only true if a certain condition is met. In this case, the condition is that the plants are watered and there is no sunlight.\n\nTo determine whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise, we need to examine the conditions that are required for the conclusion to be true. In this case, the conditions are that the plants are watered and there is no sunlight.\n\nIf the premise is true, then the plants will grow. However, the conclusion is not necessarily true if the premise is true. The conclusion requires that there is no sunlight, which is not necessarily true if the plants are watered. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premise, and the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
