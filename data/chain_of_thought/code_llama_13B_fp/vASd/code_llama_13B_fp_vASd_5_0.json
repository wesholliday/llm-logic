In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premise and conclusion and determine whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nThe premise of the argument is 'If the bill is paid, then the services will continue.' This means that if the bill is paid, then it is certain that the services will continue.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is 'If the bill is paid and the check bounces, then the services will continue.' This means that if the bill is paid and the check bounces, then it is certain that the services will continue.\n\nNow, let's examine whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise. If the bill is paid and the check bounces, then it is possible that the services will not continue. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premise, and the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
