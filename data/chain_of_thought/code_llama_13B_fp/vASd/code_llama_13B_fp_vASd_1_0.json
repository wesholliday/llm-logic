The premise states that if the match is struck, then it will light, and the conclusion states that if the match is struck and it has been soaked in water, then it will light. The conclusion logically follows from the premise because the soaking of the match in water does not affect the fact that the match will light if it is struck. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
