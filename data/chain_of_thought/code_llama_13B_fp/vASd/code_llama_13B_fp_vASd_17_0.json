In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. In this case, the premise states that changing the oil will make the car run smoothly, while the conclusion states that changing the oil and the transmission will make the car run smoothly.\n\nThe problem with this argument is that the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise. Changing the oil may improve the performance of the car, but it does not necessarily address the issue of a shot transmission. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
