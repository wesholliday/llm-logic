In this case, the premise is 'If I exercise, I will lose weight' and the conclusion is 'If I exercise and eat junk food, I will lose weight'.\n\nThe premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the condition is met. In this case, the condition is 'I exercise'. If the condition is met, then the conclusion is also true.\n\nHowever, the conclusion is not necessarily true if the condition is not met. If I do not exercise, then I will not lose weight, regardless of what I eat. Therefore, the conclusion is not necessarily true if the premise is not true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid if the premise is true, but it is not necessarily valid if the premise is false.\n\nAnswer: No",
