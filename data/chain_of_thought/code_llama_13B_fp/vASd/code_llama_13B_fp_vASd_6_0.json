The premise states that if you scream, it will hurt my ears, and the conclusion states that if you scream and I am wearing earplugs, it will hurt my ears. The conclusion follows logically from the premise because the fact that I am wearing earplugs does not change the fact that if you scream, it will hurt my ears.\n\nAnswer: yes",
