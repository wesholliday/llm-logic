In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. In this case, the premise is 'If we go to the concert, then we'll have a good time' and the conclusion is 'If we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time'.\n\nThe premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the condition (in this case, going to the concert) is met. However, the conclusion is a simple statement that does not depend on any conditions. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise, and the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
