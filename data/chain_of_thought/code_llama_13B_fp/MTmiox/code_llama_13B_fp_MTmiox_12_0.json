If the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint.\n\nTo infer 'The smip was not shripped', we need to analyze the given statements and their logical relationships.\n\n1. The first statement suggests that the smip might not have lupped the zoint, which means that it is possible that the smip did not lupped the zoint.\n2. The second statement states that if the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint. This means that if the smip was shripped, then it is certain that the smip did lupped the zoint.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationship between these two statements:\n\n1. The first statement is a possibility, while the second statement is a certainty.\n2. The first statement is about the smip lupping the zoint, while the second statement is about the smip being shripped.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we cannot infer 'The smip was not shripped' from the given statements. The reason is that the first statement is a possibility, while the second statement is a certainty. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the smip was not shripped based solely on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
