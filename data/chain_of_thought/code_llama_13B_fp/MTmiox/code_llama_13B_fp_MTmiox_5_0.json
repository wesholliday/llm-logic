If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger must have been smoogled.\n\nTo infer that the zinger was not fraggled, we need to use the information in the given statements.\n\nFirst, we can see that the first statement suggests that the zinger might not have been smoogled. This means that the zinger could have been either smoogled or not smoogled.\n\nNext, we can see that the second statement suggests that if the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger must have been smoogled. This means that if the zinger was fraggled, then it was smoogled.\n\nHowever, the first statement does not say that the zinger was fraggled. Therefore, we cannot infer that the zinger was not fraggled based solely on the first statement.\n\nIn order to infer that the zinger was not fraggled, we need to use the information in both statements. We can do this by using the fact that the zinger might not have been smoogled and the fact that if the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger must have been smoogled.\n\nIf the zinger was fraggled, then it must have been smoogled. However, the first statement suggests that the zinger might not have been smoogled. Therefore, we can conclude that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
