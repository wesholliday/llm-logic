This means that it is possible that the twonk was not varnished.\n\nNext, we can see that the second statement suggests that if the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished. This means that if the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\n\nHowever, we are not given any information about whether the twonk was plinked or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that the twonk was not plinked based solely on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
