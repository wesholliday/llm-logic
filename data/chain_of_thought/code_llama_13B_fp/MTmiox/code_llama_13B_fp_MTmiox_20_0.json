If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\n\nTo infer 'The fleeg was not bluttered', we need to apply the rules of logic. Specifically, we need to use the rule of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot both be true and false at the same time.\n\nIn this case, the first premise states that the fleeg might not have been surned, which means that it is possible for the fleeg to have not been surned. However, the second premise states that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned. This means that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned, regardless of whether or not it was actually surned.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The fleeg was not bluttered' from the given premises. The premises do not provide enough information to make a conclusion about whether or not the fleeg was bluttered.\n\nAnswer: No",
