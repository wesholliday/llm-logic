If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled.\n\nTo infer that the flugel was not blimmed, we need to analyze the given statements and their logical relationships.\n\nThe first statement suggests that the flugel might not have been zargled, which means that it is possible that the flugel was not zargled.\n\nThe second statement states that if the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled. This means that if the flugel was blimmed, then it was zargled.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical relationship between these two statements. If the flugel was blimmed, then it was zargled. But if the flugel was not blimmed, then it was not zargled. Therefore, we can conclude that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
