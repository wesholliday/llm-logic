The statement \"The smonk might not have plagged\" is not a valid statement, as it is not clear what the speaker means by \"smonk\" or \"plagged.\" Additionally, the statement \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged\" is also not a valid statement, as it is not clear what the speaker means by \"vreebled.\" Therefore, it is not possible to infer anything about the smonk's state of being vreebled or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
