If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled.\n\nTo infer that the sprocket was not cranked, we need to use the information in the given statements to reach a conclusion.\n\nFirst, we can see that the first statement suggests that the sprocket might not have been daggled. This means that the sprocket was not necessarily daggled, but it could have been.\n\nNext, we can see that the second statement suggests that if the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled. This means that if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled.\n\nNow, we can use the information in the first statement and the second statement to reach a conclusion. If the sprocket was not necessarily daggled, and if it must have been daggled if it was cranked, then we can conclude that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
