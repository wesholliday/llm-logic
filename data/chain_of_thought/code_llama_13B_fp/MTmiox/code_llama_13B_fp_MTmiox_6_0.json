If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink.\n\nTo infer that the grommet was not sploffed, we need to analyze the given statements and their logical relationships.\n\nThe first statement suggests that the grommet might not have plopped the frink, which means that it is possible that the grommet did not plop the frink.\n\nThe second statement states that if the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink. This means that if the grommet was sploffed, then it is certain that the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationship between these two statements. If the grommet was sploffed, then it is certain that the grommet plopped the frink. However, the first statement suggests that the grommet might not have plopped the frink. This means that the first statement is not necessarily true, and the grommet might have plopped the frink even if it was sploffed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the grommet was not sploffed based on the given statements. The grommet might have been sploffed, but it is also possible that it was not sploffed and still plopped the frink.\n\nAnswer: No",
