If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked.\n\nTo infer that the splat was not morphed, we need to analyze the given statements and their logical relationships.\n\nThe first statement suggests that the splat might not have quanked, which means that it is possible that the splat did not quank. However, this statement does not provide any information about whether the splat was morphed or not.\n\nThe second statement states that if the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked. This statement implies that if the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked, which means that the splat was not morphed if it did not quank.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the splat was not morphed based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
