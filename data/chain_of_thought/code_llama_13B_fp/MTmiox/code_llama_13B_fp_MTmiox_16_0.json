If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink.\n\nTo infer that the sneg was not crampled, we need to analyze the given statements and their logical relationships.\n\nThe first statement suggests that the sneg might not have sproted the frink, which means that it is possible that the sneg did not sprot the frink. However, this statement does not provide any information about whether the sneg was crampled or not.\n\nThe second statement states that if the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink. This statement implies that if the sneg was crampled, then it must have sproted the frink, regardless of whether it was crampled or not.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot infer that the sneg was not crampled. The second statement does not provide any information about whether the sneg was crampled or not, and the first statement does not provide any information about whether the sneg sproted the frink or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the sneg was not crampled based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
