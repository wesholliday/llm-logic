If the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed.\n\nTo infer 'The flug was not blummed', we need to use the information in the given statements to reach a conclusion.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first statement: \"The flug might not have been zimmed.\" This statement suggests that the flug was not zimmed, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the flug was not blummed.\n\nNext, let's look at the second statement: \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed.\" This statement suggests that if the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed. However, this statement doesn't necessarily mean that the flug was blummed.\n\nNow, let's consider the implication of the two statements:\n\n1. If the flug was not zimmed, then it might have been blummed.\n2. If the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that if the flug was not zimmed, then it might have been blummed. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that the flug was not blummed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The flug was not blummed' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
