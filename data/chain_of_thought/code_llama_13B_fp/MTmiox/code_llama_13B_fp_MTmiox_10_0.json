If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled.\n\nTo infer that the wug was not sproinged, we need to analyze the given statements and their logical relationships.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first statement: \"The wug might not have been garpled.\" This statement suggests that the wug was not garpled, but it does not provide any information about whether the wug was sproinged or not.\n\nNext, let's consider the second statement: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled.\" This statement suggests that if the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled. However, this statement does not provide any information about whether the wug was sproinged or not.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationship between the two statements. The first statement suggests that the wug was not garpled, while the second statement suggests that if the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled. However, these two statements do not provide any information about whether the wug was sproinged or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the wug was not sproinged based on the given statements. The statements do not provide any information about whether the wug was sproinged or not, and we cannot draw any conclusions about the wug's state based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
