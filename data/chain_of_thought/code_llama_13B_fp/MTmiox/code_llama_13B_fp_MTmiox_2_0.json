If the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint.\n\nTo infer that the wug was not flooped, we need to analyze the given statements and their logical relationships.\n\nThe first statement suggests that the wug might not have bimmed the zoint, which means that the wug did not bim the zoint. However, the second statement implies that if the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint. This means that if the wug was flooped, then it must have bimmed the zoint.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the wug was not flooped from the given statements. The wug might have been flooped and still not have bimmed the zoint.\n\nAnswer: No",
