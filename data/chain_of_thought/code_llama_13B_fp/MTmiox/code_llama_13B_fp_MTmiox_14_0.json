If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged.\n\nTo infer that the clug was not fleeked, we need to assume that the clug was not snugged. However, the first premise states that the clug might not have been snugged, which means that it is possible that the clug was snugged. Therefore, we cannot infer that the clug was not fleeked based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
