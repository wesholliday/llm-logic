If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged.\n\nTo infer 'The glip was not slogged', we need to apply the rules of logic. Specifically, we need to use the rule of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot both be true and false at the same time.\n\nIn this case, the first premise states that the glip might not have tragged, which means that it is possible for the glip to not have tragged. The second premise states that if the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged. However, this premise is in conflict with the first premise, as it states that if the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged, which means that the glip must have tragged, even if it was not slogged.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The glip was not slogged' from the given premises, as the second premise is in conflict with the first premise.\n\nAnswer: No",
