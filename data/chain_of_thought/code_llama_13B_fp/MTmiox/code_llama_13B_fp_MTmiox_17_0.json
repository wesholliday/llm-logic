If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'The flob was not skizzled' from these statements, we need to analyze the logical relationships between them.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first statement: 'The flob might not have movated.' This statement is a possibility, but it does not necessarily mean that the flob did not move.\n\nNext, let's look at the second statement: 'If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated.' This statement is a logical consequence of the first statement. If the flob was skizzled, then it must have moved.\n\nNow, let's consider the implication of these two statements. If the flob was skizzled, then it must have moved. But if the flob did not move, then it was not skizzled. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The flob was not skizzled' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
