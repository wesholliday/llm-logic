If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened.\n\nTo infer 'The dreb was not vroombed', we need to apply the rules of logic. Specifically, we need to use the rule of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot both be true and false at the same time.\n\nIn this case, the first premise states that the dreb might not have been spened, which means that it is possible that the dreb was not spened. However, the second premise states that if the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened. This means that if the dreb was vroombed, then it was spened.\n\nSince the first premise states that the dreb might not have been spened, and the second premise states that if the dreb was vroombed, then it was spened, we can conclude that the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
