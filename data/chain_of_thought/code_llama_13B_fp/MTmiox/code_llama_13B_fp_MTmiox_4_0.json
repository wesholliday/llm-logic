If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked.\n\nTo infer 'The fribble was not snurgled', we need to use the principle of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time.\n\nIn this case, the first premise states that the fribble might not have crinked, which means that it is possible for the fribble to not have crinked. However, the second premise states that if the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked. This means that if the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked, which contradicts the first premise.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The fribble was not snurgled' from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
