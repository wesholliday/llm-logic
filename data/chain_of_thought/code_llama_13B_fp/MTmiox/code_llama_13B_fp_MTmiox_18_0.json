If the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged.\n\nTo infer 'The shank was not plooked', we need to apply the rules of logic. Specifically, we need to use the rule of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot both be true and false at the same time.\n\nIn this case, the first premise states that the shank might not have been nugged, which means that it is possible for the shank to have been nugged or not. The second premise states that if the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged. This means that if the shank was plooked, then it must have been nugged.\n\nHowever, the first premise also states that the shank might not have been nugged. This means that it is possible for the shank to have been nugged or not. If the shank was not nugged, then it would not have been plooked, as stated in the second premise.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The shank was not plooked' from the given premises. The shank might have been plooked or not, depending on whether it was nugged or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
