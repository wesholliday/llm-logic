If we assume that Alex did not finish the race, then we can conclude that Chris did not finish the race either, since the second statement tells us that if Alex completed the race, then Chris also completed the race.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race, since we have established that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
