The second statement, 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo,' tells us that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy would also go to the zoo.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not tell us anything about whether Joe went to the park or not. It only tells us that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy would go to the zoo. Therefore, we cannot infer that Joe did not go to the park based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
