If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nTo infer that the doll was not plastic, we need to apply the rules of logic. Specifically, we need to use the rule of modus tollens, which states that if a conditional statement is true and its converse is false, then the antecedent of the conditional statement must be false.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" The converse of this statement is \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic.\" Since the premise \"The truck was not metal\" is true, and the converse \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic\" is false, we can conclude that the antecedent \"The doll was plastic\" must be false. Therefore, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
