            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'The apple was not red' from the given information, we need to analyze the logical relationships between the statements.\n\nThe first statement, 'The banana was not yellow,' is a negative statement that asserts the absence of a particular property. The second statement, 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow,' is a conditional statement that asserts a relationship between two properties.\n\nThe question is whether the absence of yellow in the banana implies the absence of red in the apple. To answer this question, we need to consider the logical relationships between the two statements.\n\nThe conditional statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' implies that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow. However, this statement does not imply that if the banana is not yellow, then the apple is not red.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The apple was not red' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
