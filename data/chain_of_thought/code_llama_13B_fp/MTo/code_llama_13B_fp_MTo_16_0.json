The second statement, 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim,' tells us that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible combinations of the two statements:\n\n1. The shirt is cotton and the pants are denim.\n2. The shirt is cotton and the pants are not denim.\n3. The shirt is not cotton and the pants are denim.\n4. The shirt is not cotton and the pants are not denim.\n\nFrom the given information, we can infer that the shirt is not cotton, because the second statement tells us that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim. Therefore, if the pants are not denim, then the shirt must be not cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
