The second statement, 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den,' tells us that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf is also in the den.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not tell us anything about the bear's location. It only tells us that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf is in the den. Therefore, we cannot infer that the bear is not in the cave based solely on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No",
