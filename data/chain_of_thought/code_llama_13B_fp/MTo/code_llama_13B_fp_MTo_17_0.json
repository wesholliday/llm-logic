If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\n\nTo infer that Ben did not eat pasta, we need to analyze the given information and the logical relationships between them.\n\nFirst, we can see that the second statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true. In this case, the antecedent is \"Ben ate pasta.\"\n\nSecond, we can see that the first statement is a negative statement, which means that it is only true if the subject (Kate) did not do the action (eat the salad).\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationships between these two statements:\n\n1. If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad. (Conditional statement)\n2. Kate did not eat the salad. (Negative statement)\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that Ben did not eat pasta. This is because the second statement contradicts the first statement, which means that the first statement is false. Therefore, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
