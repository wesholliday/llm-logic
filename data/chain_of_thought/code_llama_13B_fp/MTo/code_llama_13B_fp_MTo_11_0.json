The second statement, \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry,\" tells us that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would be blueberry-flavored.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that the cake was not chocolate. This is because the second statement only applies when the cake is chocolate, and since we know that the muffins were not blueberry-flavored, it follows that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
