If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n\nTo infer that Jeff did not play basketball, we need to analyze the given information and determine whether it is logically consistent.\n\nFirst, we can see that the second statement implies that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. This means that if Jeff played basketball, then there must be a tennis court available for Amy to play on.\n\nHowever, the first statement tells us that Amy did not play tennis. This means that there is no tennis court available for Amy to play on, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Jeff did not play basketball from the given information. The information is logically inconsistent, and we cannot draw any conclusions about Jeff's behavior based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
