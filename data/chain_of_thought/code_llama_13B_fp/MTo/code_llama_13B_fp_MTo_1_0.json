            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given information is a classic example of a logical contradiction. The first statement, \"Sue was not at the wedding,\" and the second statement, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" are both true, but they lead to a logical contradiction.\n\nIf Mary was at the wedding, then by the second statement, Sue was also at the wedding. However, the first statement states that Sue was not at the wedding. This creates a logical contradiction, as we cannot have both statements be true at the same time.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
