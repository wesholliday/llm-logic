If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n\nTo infer that Sam did not take a plane, we need to analyze the given information and the logical implications of the statements.\n\nFirst, we can see that the statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" implies that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. This is because the statement is a conditional statement, and the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nHowever, we are also given the information that Erin did not take a train. This means that the statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is not true, because Erin did not take a train.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Sam did not take a plane, because the given information does not allow us to make that inference. The statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is not logically consistent with the information that Erin did not take a train.\n\nAnswer: No",
