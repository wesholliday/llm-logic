In other words, if the book is a mystery novel, then it must have been written by James.\n\nHowever, the argument is not logically valid if the consequent (Q) is false whenever the antecedent (P) is true. In other words, if the book is a mystery novel, it does not necessarily follow that it was written by James.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer 'The book was written by James' from 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' together with 'The book is a mystery novel.'\n\nAnswer: no",
