Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nTo draw a conclusion that Joe went to the park, we need to use the given premises in a logical way. The first premise states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. This means that if we know that Lucy went to the zoo, we can infer that Joe went to the park.\n\nHowever, the second premise states that Lucy went to the zoo. This means that we already know that Lucy went to the zoo, and we don't need to use the first premise to infer that Joe went to the park.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that Joe went to the park from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
