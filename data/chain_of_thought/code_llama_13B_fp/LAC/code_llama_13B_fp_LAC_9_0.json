Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nTo logically infer 'Lisa bought the red shirt', we need to use the given information in a logical way.\n\nFirst, we can see that the first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the condition (Lisa bought the red shirt) is met.\n\nSecond, we can see that the second statement is a direct statement, which means that it is always true.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. If she did not buy the red shirt, then the first statement would not be true, and we would not be able to infer that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that if the first statement is true, then the second statement must also be true. In other words, if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
