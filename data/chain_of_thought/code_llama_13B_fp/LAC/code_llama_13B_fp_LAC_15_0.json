We can see that the first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the 'then') is true. In this case, the antecedent is 'Sam took a plane'.\n\nThe second statement is a simple statement that Erin took a train.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether we can logically infer 'Sam took a plane' from the given information. To do this, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the 'then') is true. In this case, the antecedent is 'Sam took a plane'.\n\nThe second statement is a simple statement that Erin took a train.\n\nSince the first statement is a conditional statement, we can only infer that 'Sam took a plane' is true if the antecedent (the part before the 'then') is true. In this case, the antecedent is 'Sam took a plane'.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer 'Sam took a plane' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
