Chris finished the race.\n\nTo draw a conclusion that Alex finished the race, we need to use the law of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time. In this case, we have two statements:\n\n1. If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n2. Chris finished the race.\n\nIf we assume that Alex did not finish the race, then we can conclude that Chris did not finish the race, which contradicts the second premise. Therefore, we can infer that Alex did finish the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
