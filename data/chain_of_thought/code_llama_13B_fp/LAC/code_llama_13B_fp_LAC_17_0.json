The information given is that Ben ate pasta if and only if Kate ate salad, and that Kate ate salad.\n\nTo determine whether we can logically infer that Ben ate pasta, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements. The first statement states that Ben ate pasta if and only if Kate ate salad. This means that if Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta, and vice versa.\n\nThe second statement states that Kate ate salad. This means that we know that Kate ate salad, but we don't know whether Ben ate pasta or not.\n\nBased on the information given, we cannot logically infer that Ben ate pasta. The only thing we know for sure is that Kate ate salad, but we don't know whether Ben ate pasta or not. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nAnswer: no",
