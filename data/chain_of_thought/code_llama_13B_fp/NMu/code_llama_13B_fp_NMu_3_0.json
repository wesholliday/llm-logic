This statement does not necessarily imply that the book might not have been written by James.\n\nFor example, if we know that the book was written by someone else, then we can infer that it is not the case that the book must have been written by James. However, this does not necessarily mean that the book might not have been written by James.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no. We cannot infer that the book might not have been written by James from the statement \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James.\"",
