However, it does not necessarily imply that the vampire might not have been awake.\n\nFor example, if the vampire was asleep, then it would not be the case that the vampire must have been awake, but it would still be possible that the vampire might not have been awake.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no. We cannot infer that the vampire might not have been awake from the given statement.",
