This statement does not provide any information about whether Alex actually finished the race or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Alex might not have finished the race from this statement alone. The statement only tells us that it is not necessarily true that Alex finished the race, but it does not provide any information about whether Alex actually finished the race or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
