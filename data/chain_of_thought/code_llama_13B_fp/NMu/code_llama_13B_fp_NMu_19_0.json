This statement does not provide any information about whether the watch is charging on the dresser or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The watch might not be charging on the dresser\" from this statement. The statement only tells us that it is not necessarily the case that the watch is charging on the dresser, but it does not provide any information about whether the watch is charging on the dresser or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
