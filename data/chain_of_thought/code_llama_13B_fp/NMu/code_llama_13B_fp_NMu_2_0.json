This statement does not provide any information about whether the griffin was in the forest or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The griffin might not have been in the forest\" from this statement. The statement only tells us that it is not necessarily true that the griffin was in the forest, but it does not provide any information about whether the griffin was in the forest or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
