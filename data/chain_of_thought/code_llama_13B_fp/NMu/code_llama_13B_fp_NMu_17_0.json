However, it does not necessarily mean that the scarf is not stuffed in the backpack.\n\nFor example, if the statement \"The scarf must be stuffed in my backpack\" is true, then the statement \"It's not the case that the scarf must be stuffed in my backpack\" would be false, as the scarf is indeed stuffed in the backpack.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the scarf might not be stuffed in the backpack from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
