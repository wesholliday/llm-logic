This does not necessarily mean that the notebook might not be in the drawer, as there could be other reasons why it is not in the drawer.\n\nFor example, the notebook could be in a different location, or it could be lost or misplaced. Therefore, we cannot infer that the notebook might not be in the drawer based solely on the statement \"It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
