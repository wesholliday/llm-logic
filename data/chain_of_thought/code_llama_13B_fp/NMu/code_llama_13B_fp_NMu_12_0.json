This statement does not provide any information about whether or not the jacket is draped over the chair, only that it is not necessarily the case that it is.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The jacket might not be draped over the chair\" from this statement. The statement only provides information about the possibility of the jacket being draped over the chair, not the certainty of it.\n\nAnswer: No",
