However, it does not necessarily imply that the shoes might not be in the closet.\n\nFor example, if the shoes are in the closet, then it is not the case that the shoes must be in the closet. However, if the shoes are not in the closet, then it is not the case that the shoes must be in the closet. In this case, we cannot infer that the shoes might not be in the closet.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no. We cannot infer that the shoes might not be in the closet from the statement \"It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet\".",
