This means that it is possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nHowever, the statement \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\" is a different statement than the one we started with. It is a more general statement that simply states that Lisa might not have bought the red shirt, without providing any additional information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\" from the statement \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\" The two statements are not equivalent, and we cannot make the inference you are asking about.\n\nAnswer: No",
