This statement does not provide any information about whether the toy is in the toy box or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The toy might not be in the toy box\" from this statement. The statement only tells us that the toy is not necessarily in the toy box, but it does not provide any information about whether the toy is in the toy box or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
