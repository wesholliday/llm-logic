This means that it is possible that Sue did not choose pizza, but it also means that it is not necessarily the case that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Sue might not have chosen pizza from the given statement. The statement only tells us that it is not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza, but it does not provide any information about whether Sue might have chosen pizza or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
