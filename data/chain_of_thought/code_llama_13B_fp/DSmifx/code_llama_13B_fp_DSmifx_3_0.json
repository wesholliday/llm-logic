The splat might not be quanked.\n\nTo infer that the splat is morphed, we need to analyze the given information and determine whether it is possible to conclude that the splat is morphed based on the information provided.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first statement: \"Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed.\" This statement suggests that if the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed. However, the second statement \"The splat might not be quanked\" suggests that the splat might not be quanked, which means that the first statement is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the splat is morphed based solely on the given information. The information provided does not provide enough evidence to conclude that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: No",
