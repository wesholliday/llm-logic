The flugel might not be zargled.\n\nTo infer that the flugel is blimmed, we need to use the information in the first statement to determine the possible states of the flugel.\n\nThe first statement implies that the flugel is either zargled or blimmed. If the flugel is not zargled, then it must be blimmed. Therefore, we can conclude that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
