This means that if the grommet is not plopped, it must be sploffed.\n\nThe second statement, 'The grommet might not be plopped,' suggests that the grommet is not necessarily plopped. This means that the grommet could be either plopped or sploffed, depending on the context.\n\nBased on these two statements, we cannot infer that the grommet is sploffed. The grommet could be either plopped or sploffed, depending on the context. Therefore, the answer is 'no'.",
