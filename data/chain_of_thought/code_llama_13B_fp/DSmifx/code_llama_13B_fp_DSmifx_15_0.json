The dreb might not be spened.\n\nTo infer that the dreb is vroombed, we need to analyze the given information and determine whether it is logically consistent.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first statement: \"Either the dreb must be spened or it is vroombed.\" This statement implies that if the dreb is not spened, then it must be vroombed.\n\nNext, let's consider the second statement: \"The dreb might not be spened.\" This statement suggests that the dreb is not necessarily spened, but it could be.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information together. If the dreb is not spened, then it must be vroombed, as stated in the first statement. However, if the dreb is not necessarily spened, then it could be vroombed without being spened. Therefore, we cannot infer that the dreb is vroombed based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
