The shank might not be nugged.\n\nTo infer that the shank is plooked, we need to analyze the given information and determine whether it is possible to draw that conclusion based on the information provided.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first statement: \"Either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked.\" This statement suggests that if the shank is not nugged, it must be plooked. However, the second statement \"The shank might not be nugged\" suggests that the shank is not necessarily nugged.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the shank is plooked based solely on the given information. The shank might be nugged or it might be plooked, but we cannot say for certain which it is.\n\nAnswer: No",
