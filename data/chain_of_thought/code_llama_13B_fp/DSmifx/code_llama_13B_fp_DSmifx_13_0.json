The glip might not be tragged.\n\nTo infer that the glip is slogged, we need to use the information in a logical way. We can do this by using the principle of excluded middle, which states that for any proposition, either it is true or it is false.\n\nUsing this principle, we can say that either the glip is tragged or it is slogged. Since we know that the glip might not be tragged, we can conclude that the glip must be slogged.\n\nTherefore, the inference is:\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe given information is:\n\n1.
