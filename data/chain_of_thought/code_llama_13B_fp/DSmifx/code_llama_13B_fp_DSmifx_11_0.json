The flug might not be zimmed.\n\nTo infer that the flug is blummed, we need to use the information in the first statement to eliminate the possibility that the flug is zimmed.\n\nIf the flug is zimmed, then it cannot be blummed, as the two statements are mutually exclusive. Therefore, if the flug is zimmed, we can conclude that it is not blummed.\n\nHowever, the second statement tells us that the flug might not be zimmed. This means that there is a possibility that the flug is not zimmed, which is consistent with the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the flug is blummed from the given information. The answer is no.",
