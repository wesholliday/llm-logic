The flob might not be movated.\n\nTo infer that the flob is skizzled, we need to analyze the given information and determine whether it is possible to conclude that the flob is skizzled based on the information provided.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first statement: \"Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled.\" This statement suggests that if the flob is not movated, then it is skizzled. However, the second statement \"The flob might not be movated\" suggests that the flob is not necessarily movated.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that the flob is skizzled based solely on the given information. The flob might be movated or it might not be movated, and we do not know which one it is.\n\nAnswer: No",
