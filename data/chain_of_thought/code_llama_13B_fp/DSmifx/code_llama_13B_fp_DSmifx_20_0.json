The fleeg might not be surned.\n\nTo infer that the fleeg is bluttered, we need to analyze the given information and determine whether it is possible to conclude that the fleeg is bluttered based on the information provided.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first statement: \"Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered.\" This statement suggests that if the fleeg is not surned, it must be bluttered. However, the second statement \"The fleeg might not be surned\" suggests that the fleeg might not be surned, which means that the first statement is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the fleeg is bluttered based solely on the given information. The information provided does not provide enough evidence to conclude that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nAnswer: No",
