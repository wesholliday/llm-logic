We know that the statement 'The unicorn was in the forest' is true, but we don't know whether the griffin was in the forest or not.\n\nIf the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest, but we don't know whether the unicorn was in the forest or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the griffin was in the forest.\n\nAnswer: No",
