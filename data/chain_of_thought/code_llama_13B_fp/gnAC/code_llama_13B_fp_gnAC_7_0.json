Chris finished the race.\n\nTo determine whether Alex finished the race, we need to analyze the given information and determine whether it is logically consistent.\n\n1. If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (Alex finished the race) is true.\n2. Chris finished the race. This statement is a simple statement of fact, which means that it is always true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This statement is true, because Alex finishing the race implies that Chris also finished the race.\n2. Chris finished the race. This statement is true, because Chris did in fact finish the race.\n\nBased on the given information, it is not necessarily true that Alex finished the race. The only thing we can conclude is that if Alex finished the race, then Chris also finished the race. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nAnswer: no",
