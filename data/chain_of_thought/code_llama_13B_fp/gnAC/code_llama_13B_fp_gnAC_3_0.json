'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel'\n2. 'The book is a mystery novel'\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n'The book was written by James'\n\nTo determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises, we need to evaluate whether the premises are sufficient to guarantee the conclusion.\n\nIn this case, the first premise states that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. This premise does not provide any information about whether the book was written by James or not. Therefore, this premise does not provide any information that would allow us to conclude that the book was written by James.\n\nThe second premise states that the book is a mystery novel. This premise does not provide any information about who wrote the book. Therefore, this premise does not provide any information that would allow us to conclude that the book was written by James.\n\nSince neither premise provides any information that would allow us to conclude that the book was written by James, we cannot conclude that 'The book was written by James' is true.\n\nAnswer: No",
