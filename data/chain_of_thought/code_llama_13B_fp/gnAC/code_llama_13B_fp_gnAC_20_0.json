            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true. In this case, the antecedent is \"the apple was red.\"\n\nThe statement \"The banana was yellow\" is also true.\n\nSo, we have two true statements:\n\n1. \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\"\n2. \"The banana was yellow\"\n\nNow, we need to determine whether \"The apple was red\" is true.\n\nTo do this, we need to apply the law of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time.\n\nIn this case, we have two true statements, so we can apply the law of non-contradiction to determine whether \"The apple was red\" is true.\n\nIf \"The apple was red\" were false, then we would have a contradiction, because \"The apple was red\" and \"The apple was not red\" cannot both be true at the same time.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that \"The apple was red\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
