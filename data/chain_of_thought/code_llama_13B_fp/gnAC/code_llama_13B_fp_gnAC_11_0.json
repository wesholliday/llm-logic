We know that the conditional statement is true, and we also know that 'The muffins were blueberry' is true. However, we don't know whether 'The cake was chocolate' is true or not.\n\nIn order to determine whether 'The cake was chocolate' is true, we need to evaluate the antecedent and consequent of the conditional statement. The antecedent is 'The cake was chocolate', and the consequent is 'The muffins were blueberry'.\n\nIf the antecedent is true, then we know that 'The cake was chocolate' is true. However, we don't know whether the consequent is true or not. In this case, the consequent is 'The muffins were blueberry', and we know that this is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that 'The cake was chocolate' is true based solely on the information provided. The conditional statement 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' is true, but we don't know whether 'The cake was chocolate' is true or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
