            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether 'The vampire was awake' is true, we need to examine the given information and the logical relationships between them.\n\nThe first piece of information is 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake'. This statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the 'then') is true. In this case, the antecedent is 'the vampire was awake', and the consequent is 'the mummy was awake'.\n\nThe second piece of information is 'The mummy was awake'. This statement is a simple statement of fact, and it is not a conditional statement.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether the first statement implies the second statement. To do this, we need to examine the logical relationships between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement implies the second statement if the antecedent is true, and the consequent is also true. In this case, the antecedent is 'the vampire was awake', and the consequent is 'the mummy was awake'.\n\nSince we know that 'The mummy was awake' is true, we can conclude that the antecedent is also true. Therefore, the first statement implies the second statement, and we can conclude that 'The vampire was awake' is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
