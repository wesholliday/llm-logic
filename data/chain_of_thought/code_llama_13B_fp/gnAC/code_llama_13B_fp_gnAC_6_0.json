This statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the 'then') is true. In this case, the antecedent is 'Sue chose pizza', and the consequent is 'Bob chose pasta'.\n\nThe second piece of information is 'Bob chose pasta'. This statement is a simple statement of fact, and it is not dependent on any other information.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical relationships between these two statements. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent is true. In this case, the antecedent is 'Sue chose pizza', and the consequent is 'Bob chose pasta'.\n\nThe second statement is a simple statement of fact, and it is not dependent on any other information.\n\nSo, to determine whether 'Sue chose pizza' is true, we need to examine the antecedent of the first statement. If the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true. In this case, the antecedent is 'Sue chose pizza', and the consequent is 'Bob chose pasta'.\n\nSince we know that 'Bob chose pasta' is true, we can conclude that 'Sue chose pizza' is also true. Therefore, the answer is 'yes'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
