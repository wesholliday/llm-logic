If the antecedent (the part before 'then') is true, then the consequent (the part after 'then') must also be true. In this case, the antecedent is 'Jeff played basketball', and the consequent is 'Amy played tennis'.\n\nSince we know that 'Amy played tennis' is true, we can conclude that the antecedent must also be true. Therefore, 'Jeff played basketball' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
