            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true. In this case, the antecedent is \"Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe statement \"Sue was at the wedding\" is also true.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true. The reason is that the conditional statement only implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. It does not say anything about the opposite case, which is that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was also at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, it is not necessarily true that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true, even though both statements are true.\n\nAnswer: No",
