If the antecedent (Tom watched football) is true, then the consequent (Jen watched basketball) must also be true. However, we are given that the consequent is true, so we need to determine whether the antecedent is also true.\n\nIn this case, we are not given any information about whether Tom watched football or not, so we cannot determine whether the antecedent is true or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether 'Tom watched football' is true or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
