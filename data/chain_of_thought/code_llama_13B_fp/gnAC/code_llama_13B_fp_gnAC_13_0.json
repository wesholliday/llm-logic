            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true. In this case, the antecedent is \"the car was red.\"\n\nThe statement \"The truck was blue\" is also true.\n\nSo, we have two true statements:\n\n1. \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\"\n2. \"The truck was blue\"\n\nNow, we need to determine whether \"The car was red\" is true.\n\nTo do this, we need to apply the law of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time.\n\nIn this case, we have two true statements, so we can apply the law of non-contradiction to determine whether \"The car was red\" is true.\n\nIf \"The car was red\" were true, then it would be contradictory to have \"The truck was blue\" be true, since \"The car was red\" implies that the truck was not blue.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that \"The car was red\" is not true, since it would lead to a contradiction.\n\nAnswer: No",
