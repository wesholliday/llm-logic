The original statement \"The candidate might win or lose the election\" implies that there are two possible outcomes: the candidate winning or the candidate losing. The word \"or\" is a disjunction, indicating that one or the other (or both) of the outcomes can occur. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the candidate might win the election and the candidate might lose the election, as these are the two possibilities being considered.\n\nAnswer: yes"
