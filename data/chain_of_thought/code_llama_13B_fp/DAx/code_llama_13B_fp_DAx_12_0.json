This is a conditional statement, which means that the conclusion only follows if the premise is true.\n\nThe second statement, 'The smip was not shripped,' provides additional information that the smip was not shripped. This contradicts the first statement, as the premise of the first statement is that the smip was shripped.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The smip did not lup the zoint' from the given information. The first statement alone does not provide enough information to make this inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
