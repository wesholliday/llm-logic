The argument is based on a logical fallacy, specifically, the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nThe fallacy of affirming the consequent occurs when we assume that the conclusion of a conditional statement is true, even if the premise is false. In this case, the premise is 'If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged', which is a conditional statement. The conclusion is 'The shank was not nugged', which is the opposite of the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The shank was not nugged' from the given premises, as the argument is based on a logical fallacy.\n\nAnswer: no",
