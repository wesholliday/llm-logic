It means that if the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink. However, the statement \"The grommet was not sploffed\" is a fact. It means that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nNow, we need to use the conditional statement to infer whether the grommet plopped the frink or not. If the grommet was not sploffed, then it did not plop the frink. Therefore, we can infer that the grommet did not plop the frink.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
