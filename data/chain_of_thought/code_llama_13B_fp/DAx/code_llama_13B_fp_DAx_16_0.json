This statement is a logical implication, which means that if the antecedent (the sneg was crampled) is true, then the consequent (the sneg sproted the frink) must also be true.\n\nOn the other hand, 'The sneg was not crampled' is a statement that states that the sneg was not crampled. This statement is a negation, which means that it is a statement that denies the existence or occurrence of something.\n\nNow, we can use the rules of logic to determine whether we can infer 'The sneg did not sprot the frink' from 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink' together with 'The sneg was not crampled'.\n\nFirst, we need to determine whether the antecedent of the conditional statement is true. In this case, the antecedent is 'The sneg was crampled', which is false according to the second statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that the consequent is true.\n\nSecond, we need to determine whether the consequent of the conditional statement is true. In this case, the consequent is 'The sneg sproted the frink', which is false according to the second statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that the consequent is true.\n\nFinally, we can conclude that we cannot infer 'The sneg did not sprot the frink' from 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink' together with 'The sneg was not crampled'. The reason is that the antecedent and consequent of the conditional statement are both false, which means that the statement is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
