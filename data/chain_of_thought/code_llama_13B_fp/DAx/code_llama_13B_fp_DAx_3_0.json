It means that if the splat was morphed, then it would also quank. However, the statement \"The splat was not morphed\" contradicts this. It means that the splat was not morphed, which means that it did not quank.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the splat did not quank from the given information. The information provided does not provide enough evidence to make such an inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
