This implies that the fleeg was bluttered and surned at the same time.\n\nThe second statement, 'The fleeg was not bluttered,' contradicts the first statement by stating that the fleeg was not bluttered. This means that the fleeg was not bluttered and did not surn at the same time.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The fleeg did not surn' from the given information. The two statements are contradictory, and we cannot draw any conclusions about the fleeg's behavior based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No",
