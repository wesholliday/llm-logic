It states that if the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened. This means that if the first premise is true, then the second premise must also be true.\n\nThe second premise, 'The dreb was not vroombed,' is a negative statement. It states that the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion, 'The dreb was not spened.' This is a negative statement that states that the dreb was not spened.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'The dreb was not spened' from the given premises, we need to examine the logical relationships between the statements.\n\nIf the first premise is true, then the second premise must also be true. However, the second premise states that the dreb was not vroombed, which is a negative statement. Therefore, the second premise is not necessarily true.\n\nIn conclusion, we cannot infer 'The dreb was not spened' from the given premises. The first premise does not necessarily imply the second premise, and the second premise is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: No",
