This means that the two statements are not contradictory, and we cannot infer that the zinger was not smoogled based solely on the first statement.\n\nThe second statement, 'The zinger was not fraggled,' provides additional information that the zinger is not fraggled. This information is consistent with the first statement, as it suggests that the zinger is not fraggled, which means it is not smoogled either.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the zinger was not smoogled.\n\nAnswer: No",
