In this case, the first part is 'The flug was blummed', and the second part is 'The flug was zimmed'.\n\n'The flug was not blummed' is a negative statement, which means that the flug was not blummed.\n\nNow, we need to consider the logical relationship between these two statements. If the flug was not blummed, then it is not necessarily the case that the flug was zimmed. In other words, the fact that the flug was not blummed does not necessarily imply that the flug was zimmed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The flug was not zimmed' from 'If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed' together with 'The flug was not blummed'.\n\nAnswer: No",
