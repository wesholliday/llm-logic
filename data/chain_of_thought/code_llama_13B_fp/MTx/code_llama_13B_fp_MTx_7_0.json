This means that if the whiffle was not shanked, it would not make a tinkling sound.\n\nThe second statement, 'The whiffle did not tink,' tells us that the whiffle did not make a tinkling sound. This information is consistent with the first statement, as it suggests that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The whiffle was not shanked.'\n\nAnswer: yes",
