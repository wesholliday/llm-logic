The grommet did not plop the frink.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the grommet was not sploffed, we need to analyze the logical relationships between the statements.\n\nThe first statement implies that if the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink. This means that if the grommet was not sploffed, then it is not necessarily true that the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nThe second statement states that the grommet did not plop the frink. This means that the grommet did not plop the frink, regardless of whether it was sploffed or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the grommet was not sploffed based solely on the given statements. The grommet could have been sploffed and still not plopped the frink, or it could have been not sploffed and still plopped the frink. We need more information to make a conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No",
