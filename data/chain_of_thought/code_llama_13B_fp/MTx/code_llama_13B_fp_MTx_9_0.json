This means that if the twonk was not plinked, then it was not varnished.\n\nThe second statement, \"The twonk was not varnished,\" tells us that the twonk was not varnished. This information is independent of the first statement and does not provide any additional information about whether the twonk was plinked or not.\n\nBased on the information provided, we cannot infer that the twonk was not plinked. The first statement does not provide any information about whether the twonk was plinked or not, and the second statement only tells us that the twonk was not varnished. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the twonk was not plinked based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
