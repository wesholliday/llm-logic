This means that if the shank was plooked, it is necessarily true that the shank was nugged.\n\nThe second premise states that the shank was not nugged. This means that the shank was not plooked, because if the shank was plooked, it would have been nugged.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shank was not plooked from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
