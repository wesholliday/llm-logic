This implies that if the flob was not skizzled, then it would not move.\n\nThe second statement, 'The flob did not movate,' provides additional information that the flob did not move. This contradicts the first statement, which suggests that if the flob was skizzled, then it would move.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The flob was not skizzled' from the given information. The statements are contradictory, and we cannot draw any conclusions about the flob's state of being skizzled or not based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
