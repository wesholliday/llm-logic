            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'The zinger was not fraggled' from the given premises, we need to analyze the logical relationships between them.\n\nThe first premise states that if the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled. This means that if the zinger was fraggled, then it is also the case that the zinger was smoogled.\n\nThe second premise states that the zinger was not smoogled. This means that the zinger was not smoogled, regardless of whether it was fraggled or not.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether the first premise logically implies the second premise. In other words, we need to determine whether the first premise entails the second premise.\n\nTo do this, we can use a logical analysis tool called a truth table. A truth table is a table that shows the truth values of a statement for all possible combinations of input values.\n\nHere is a truth table for the first premise:\n\n| Fraggled | Smoogled |\n| --- | --- |\n| T | T |\n| F | F |\n\nAs you can see, the first premise is true when the zinger is fraggled and smoogled, and false when the zinger is not fraggled and not smoogled.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise:\n\n| Smoogled |\n| --- |\n| F |\n\nAs you can see, the second premise is false when the zinger is smoogled, and true when it is not smoogled.\n\nNow, let's use the truth table to determine whether the first premise logically implies the second premise. We can do this by filling in the truth values for the first premise and the second premise in the truth table, and then checking whether the first premise logically implies the second premise.\n\nHere is the completed truth table:\n\n| Fraggled | Smoogled | Smoogled |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| T | T | T |\n| F | F | F |\n\nAs you can see, the first premise logically implies the second premise, because the first premise is true when the zinger is fraggled and smoogled, and the second premise is true when the zinger is not smoogled. Therefore, we can infer that the zinger was not fraggled from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
