This means that if the clug was fleeked, then it is also the case that the clug snugged.\n\nThe second premise states that the clug did not snugged. This means that the clug did not snugged, regardless of whether it was fleeked or not.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether the first premise and the second premise are logically consistent. If they are consistent, then we can infer that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nTo determine whether the premises are consistent, we need to analyze the logical relationships between them. In this case, the first premise implies that if the clug was fleeked, then it is also the case that the clug snugged. The second premise states that the clug did not snugged.\n\nIf we assume that the first premise is true, then we can conclude that the clug was fleeked. However, the second premise states that the clug did not snugged, which contradicts the first premise. Therefore, the premises are not logically consistent, and we cannot infer that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: No",
