However, the statement \"The wug was not garpled\" is a fact. It means that the wug was not garpled.\n\nNow, we need to use the conditional statement to infer whether the wug was sproinged or not. If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled. But, the wug was not garpled. Therefore, we can infer that the wug was not sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
