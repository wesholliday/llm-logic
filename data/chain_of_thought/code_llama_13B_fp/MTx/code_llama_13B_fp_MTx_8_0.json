The sprocket was not daggled.\n\nTo infer that the sprocket was not cranked, we need to apply the rules of logic. Specifically, we need to use the rule of modus tollens, which states that if a conditional statement is true and its negation is true, then the antecedent of the conditional statement must be false.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\" The negation of this statement is \"The sprocket was not daggled.\" Since the conditional statement is true and its negation is true, we can conclude that the antecedent of the conditional statement, \"The sprocket was cranked,\" must be false. Therefore, we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
