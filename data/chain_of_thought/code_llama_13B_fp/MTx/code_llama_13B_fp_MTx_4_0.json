This means that if the fribble was snurgled, then it would not be crinked.\n\nThe second statement, 'The fribble did not crink', tells us that the fribble did not crink. This means that the fribble was not snurgled, because if it was snurgled, it would have crinked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the fribble was not snurgled, because the second statement tells us that the fribble did not crink, and the first statement tells us that if the fribble was snurgled, it would have crinked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
