The premises are 'If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed' and 'The flug was not zimmed'. The conclusion is 'The flug was not blummed'.\n\nNext, we need to determine whether the premises logically entail the conclusion. In other words, we need to determine whether the conclusion can be deduced from the premises using valid logical reasoning.\n\nTo do this, we need to examine the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. In this case, the conclusion is the negation of the first premise, which is 'The flug was not blummed'. The first premise is 'If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed', which is a conditional statement.\n\nIf we assume that the first premise is true, then we can deduce that the second premise is also true. However, if we assume that the first premise is false, then we cannot deduce anything about the second premise.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The flug was not blummed' from 'If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed' together with 'The flug was not zimmed'.\n\nAnswer: No",
