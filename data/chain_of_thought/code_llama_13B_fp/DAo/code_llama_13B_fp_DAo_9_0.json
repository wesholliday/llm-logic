            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt' from the given information, we need to analyze the logical relationships between the statements.\n\nThe first statement, 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt,' tells us that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. The second statement, 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt,' tells us that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications of these statements. If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then it is not the case that she bought the red shirt. Therefore, the conditional statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is not true.\n\nSince the conditional statement is not true, we cannot infer that Mark bought the blue shirt. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
