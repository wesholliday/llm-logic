This statement alone does not tell us anything about the presence or absence of the wolf in the den.\n\nSecond, we have 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den'. This statement implies that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must also be in the den. However, it does not tell us anything about the presence or absence of the wolf in the den if the bear is not in the cave.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The wolf was not in the den' from 'The bear was not in the cave' together with 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den'.\n\nAnswer: no",
