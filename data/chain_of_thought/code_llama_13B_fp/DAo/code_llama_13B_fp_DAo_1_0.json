The second statement, 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications of these statements. If Mary was not at the wedding, then it is not possible for Sue to be at the wedding, since the second statement only applies when Mary is at the wedding. Therefore, we cannot infer that Sue was not at the wedding from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
