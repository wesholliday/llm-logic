To do this, we need to analyze the logical relationships between the statements.\n\nIf we assume that Ben did not eat pasta, then we can conclude that Kate did not eat salad. This is because the second statement implies that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad. Since Ben did not eat pasta, it follows that Kate did not eat salad.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Kate did not eat salad from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
