            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'Lucy did not go to the zoo' from the given information, we need to analyze the logical relationships between the statements.\n\nThe first statement, 'Joe did not go to the park,' is a negative statement that implies that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nThe second statement, 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo,' is a conditional statement that implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationships between these two statements:\n\n1. The first statement, 'Joe did not go to the park,' is a negative statement that implies that Joe did not go to the park.\n2. The second statement, 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo,' is a conditional statement that implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nSince the first statement is negative, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park. Therefore, we can conclude that Lucy did not go to the zoo, because the second statement implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
