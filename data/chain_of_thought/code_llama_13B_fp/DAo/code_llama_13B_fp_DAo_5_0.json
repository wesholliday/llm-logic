            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'Amy did not play tennis' from the given information, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement, 'Jeff did not play basketball,' is a negative statement that asserts that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nThe second statement, 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis,' is a conditional statement that asserts that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n\nThe logical structure of this statement is as follows:\n\nIf Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which means that it asserts that if a certain condition is met (in this case, Jeff playing basketball), then a certain consequence will follow (in this case, Amy playing tennis).\n\nHowever, the first statement, 'Jeff did not play basketball,' contradicts the condition of the second statement, which is that Jeff played basketball. Therefore, we cannot infer that Amy played tennis from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
