If the vampire was awake, then the mummy would also be awake, since the statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' is true.\n\nHowever, we are given the information that the vampire was not awake. This means that the assumption that the vampire was awake was incorrect, and we can conclude that the vampire was not awake.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the mummy was not awake, since the vampire was not awake and the mummy was awake if the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
