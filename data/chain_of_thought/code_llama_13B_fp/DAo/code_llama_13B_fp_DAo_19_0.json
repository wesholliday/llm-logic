The second statement, 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball,' tells us that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not tell us anything about whether Jen watched basketball if Tom did not watch football. In other words, the second statement does not provide any additional information about Jen's behavior.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Jen did not watch basketball' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
