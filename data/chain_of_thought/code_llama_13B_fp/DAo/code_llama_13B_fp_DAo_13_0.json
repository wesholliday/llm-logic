This means that the car is not red.\n\nNext, we have 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'. This means that if the car is red, then the truck is blue.\n\nNow, we need to apply the logic of the given statements to determine whether we can infer 'The truck was not blue'.\n\nIf we assume that the car is not red, then we can conclude that the car is not blue. However, this does not necessarily mean that the truck is not blue.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The truck was not blue' from 'The car was not red' together with 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'.\n\nAnswer: No",
