            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'The truck was not metal' from 'The doll was not plastic' together with 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal', we need to follow the logical reasoning.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the meaning of the given statements. 'The doll was not plastic' means that the doll was not made of plastic. 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' means that if the doll was made of plastic, then the truck was made of metal.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given statements:\n\n1. 'The doll was not plastic'\n2. 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'\n\nFrom the given statements, we can conclude that the doll was not made of plastic. However, we cannot infer that the truck was not made of metal based solely on this information. The statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' only tells us that if the doll was made of plastic, then the truck was made of metal. It does not tell us anything about the material of the truck if the doll was not made of plastic.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The truck was not metal' from 'The doll was not plastic' together with 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'.\n\nAnswer: No",
