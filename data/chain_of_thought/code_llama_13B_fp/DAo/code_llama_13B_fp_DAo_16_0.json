            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the pants were not denim from the given information, we need to analyze the logical relationships between the statements.\n\nThe first statement, \"The shirt was not cotton,\" implies that the shirt was made of a different material than cotton.\n\nThe second statement, \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim,\" implies that if the shirt was made of cotton, then the pants must be made of denim.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that if the shirt was not cotton, then we cannot infer that the pants were denim. This is because the second statement only applies when the shirt is cotton, and if the shirt is not cotton, then the second statement does not apply.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the pants were not denim from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
