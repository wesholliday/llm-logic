The first statement states that either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag. The second statement states that the sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the sunglasses are not necessarily perched on her head. However, we do not know for certain whether they are in her bag or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that the sunglasses are in her bag based solely on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No",
