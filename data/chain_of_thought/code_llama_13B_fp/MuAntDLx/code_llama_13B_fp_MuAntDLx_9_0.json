This is a disjunction, which means it is a statement that combines two or more statements with 'or'. In this case, it is saying that the floob must be either wobble or on wozzle. \n\nTo infer 'The floob must be wobble', we would need to know that the floob cannot be on wozzle. However, the statement does not provide any information about the relationship between the two options, or that one option is exclusive of the other. Therefore, we cannot infer that the floob must be wobble.\n\nAnswer: no"
