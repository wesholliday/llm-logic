The statement is 'The glorp must be wozzle frazzle or blurble'. This is a disjunctive statement, meaning it presents two alternatives: either 'The glorp must be wozzle frazzle' or 'The glorp must be blurble'. The use of 'or' indicates that these are mutually exclusive possibilities. \n\nSince we are trying to infer 'The glorp must be wozzle frazzle', we need to consider if the statement provides any direct or indirect evidence to support this conclusion. However, the statement does not provide any information that directly supports or contradicts 'The glorp must be wozzle frazzle'. It only presents two alternatives, neither of which is proven or disproven by the statement itself.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we cannot infer 'The glorp must be wozzle frazzle' because the statement does not provide any direct or indirect evidence to support this conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
