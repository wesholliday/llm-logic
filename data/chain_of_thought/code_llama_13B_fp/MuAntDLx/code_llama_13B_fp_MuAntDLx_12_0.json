It follows the pattern of:\n\nAll A are B\nX is A\n\u2234 X is B\n\nIn this case, the original statement can be broken down as follows:\n\nAll blimps are quank (implied by \"or blimp\")\nThe zizz must be quank by blimp (the original statement)\n\nUsing the syllogism pattern, we can infer that if all blimps are quank, and the zizz must be quank by blimp, then the zizz must indeed be quank.\n\nAnswer: yes"
