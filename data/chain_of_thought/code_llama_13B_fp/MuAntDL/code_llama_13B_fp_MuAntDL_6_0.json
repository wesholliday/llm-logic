            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The concert must have been sold out' from 'The concert must have been sold out or postponed', let's break down the statement. The phrase 'or' is a logical operator that indicates an exclusive disjunction, meaning that only one of the two options can be true at the same time. If the concert was postponed, it would not be sold out, and vice versa. Therefore, if we know that the concert must have been sold out or postponed, it implies that it was indeed sold out, as the other option (postponed) would be mutually exclusive.\n\nAnswer: yes"
