However, this does not provide any information about the wibble's state when it is not a quibble. The original statement does not provide any information about the wibble's zibber state, regardless of whether it is a quibble or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that the wibble must be zibber based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
