The words \"zibble\", \"wozzle\", and \"zump\" are not related to each other in any meaningful way, and the statement doesn't provide any context or information that would allow us to make a logical connection to the additional phrase \"frazzle wozzle wibble\". In other words, there is no logical or grammatical connection between the two phrases, and we can't infer the second phrase from the first.\n\nAnswer: no"
