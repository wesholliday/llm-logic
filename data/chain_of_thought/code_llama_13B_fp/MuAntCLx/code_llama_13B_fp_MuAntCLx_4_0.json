This statement implies a location, but it does not provide any information about the bimboozle's state or condition within that location. It only specifies the location itself. Therefore, we cannot infer that the bimboozle must be in the flump quazzle, as that is an additional condition that is not mentioned in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
