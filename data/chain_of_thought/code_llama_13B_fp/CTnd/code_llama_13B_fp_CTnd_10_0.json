However, this does not necessarily mean that if helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered.\n\nFor example, if a doctor offers a patient advice that is not helpful, it does not mean that the doctor did not offer any advice at all. The doctor may have offered other types of advice that were helpful, but the patient may not have taken it.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered.\n\nAnswer: No",
