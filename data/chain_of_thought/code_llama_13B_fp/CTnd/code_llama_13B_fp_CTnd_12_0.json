The statement \"If Jane studied, then she did not study long\" is a contradiction because it implies that if Jane studied, then she did not study long, but this is a logical contradiction because if Jane studied, then she must have studied for some amount of time, which means that she did not study long.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Jane studied long, then she did not study\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
