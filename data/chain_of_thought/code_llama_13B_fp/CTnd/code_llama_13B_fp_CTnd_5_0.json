The statement \"If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly\" implies that if the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly. However, this is a logical contradiction because if the room was cleaned, then it was cleaned thoroughly. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
