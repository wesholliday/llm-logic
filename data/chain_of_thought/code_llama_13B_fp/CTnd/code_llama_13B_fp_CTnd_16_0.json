The statement \"If the job was completed, then it was not completed well\" is a contradiction because it implies that if the job was completed, then it was not completed well. This is a logical contradiction because if the job was completed, then it was completed well, but the statement says that if the job was completed, then it was not completed well.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the job was completed well, then it was not completed\" from the given statement. The statement is a logical contradiction, and it does not provide any information about the relationship between the two statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
