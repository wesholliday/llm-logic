If directions were provided, then they were not explained clearly, which means that the directions were not explained in a clear and concise manner. However, if directions were explained clearly, then they were provided, which means that the directions were given in a clear and concise manner. Therefore, we cannot infer that if directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
