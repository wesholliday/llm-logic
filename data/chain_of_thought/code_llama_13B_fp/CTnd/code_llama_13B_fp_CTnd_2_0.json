In this case, the antecedent is 'Ann exercised' and the consequent is 'she did not exercise strenuously'.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise', we need to consider the truth of the antecedent and the consequent. If the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true. However, if the consequent is false, then the antecedent can still be true.\n\nIn this case, the antecedent is 'Ann exercised strenuously', and the consequent is 'she did not exercise'. If the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true, which means that if Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
