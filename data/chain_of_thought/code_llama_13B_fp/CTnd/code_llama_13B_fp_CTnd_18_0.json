This is because discussing an issue in depth means that it was discussed, and if it was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed. The statement is a logical contradiction, and it is not possible to draw any conclusions from it.\n\nAnswer: no",
