The statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" implies that the milk is either on the counter or in the fridge, but it does not exclude the possibility that the milk is in neither location.\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" implies that the milk is not necessarily in the fridge, but it does not rule out the possibility that the milk is in the fridge.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: No",
