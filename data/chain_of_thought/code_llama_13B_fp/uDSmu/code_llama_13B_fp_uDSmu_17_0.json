The scarf is either stuffed in the backpack or draped on the coat rack.\n2. It is not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\n\nFrom these two pieces of information, we can conclude that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack. This is because the first piece of information states that the scarf is either stuffed in the backpack or draped on the coat rack, and the second piece of information states that it is not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack. Therefore, we can infer that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
