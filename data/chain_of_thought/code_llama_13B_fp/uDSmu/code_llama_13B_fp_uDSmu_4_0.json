However, the question also states that it's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom.\n\nTo determine whether the cat is napping on the couch or not, we need to consider all the possible scenarios. In this case, there are two possible scenarios:\n\n1. The cat is napping on the couch.\n2. The cat is playing in the bedroom.\n\nSince the question states that the cat is not playing in the bedroom, we can rule out scenario 2. This leaves us with scenario 1, where the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes, we can infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
