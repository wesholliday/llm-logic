Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet.\n2. It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\n\nFrom the first piece of information, we can infer that the jacket is either draped over the chair or not hanging in the closet. However, the second piece of information tells us that the jacket is not hanging in the closet, so we can conclude that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
