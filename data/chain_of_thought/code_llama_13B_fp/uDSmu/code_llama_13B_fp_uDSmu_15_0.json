The statement \"Either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door\" implies that the shoes are either in the closet or lined up by the door, but it does not exclude the possibility that the shoes are in neither location.\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door\" implies that the shoes are not lined up by the door, but it does not necessarily mean that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: No",
