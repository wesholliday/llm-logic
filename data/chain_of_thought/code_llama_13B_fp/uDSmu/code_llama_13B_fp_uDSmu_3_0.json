The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" implies that the keys are either in the drawer or in the cabinet, but it does not exclude the possibility that they are not in either location.\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" implies that the keys are not necessarily dangling in the cabinet, but it does not provide any information about whether they are in the drawer or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: No",
