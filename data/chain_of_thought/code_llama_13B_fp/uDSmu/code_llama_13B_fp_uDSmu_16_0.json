However, the question also states that it's not the case that the pen must be on my desk. This creates a logical contradiction, as the assumption that the pen must be on my desk is incompatible with the assumption that the pen is in my bag.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the pen is in my bag. The only conclusion we can draw from the information provided is that the pen is not on my desk, but we don't know where it is.\n\nAnswer: No",
