The missing sock is either in the laundry basket or under the bed.\n2. It is not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\n\nFrom these two pieces of information, we can conclude that the missing sock is not necessarily under the bed. However, we are not given any information about whether the missing sock is in the laundry basket or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: No",
