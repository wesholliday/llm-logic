The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" implies that the remote control is either on the coffee table or under the couch, but it does not exclude the possibility that it is somewhere else.\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" implies that the remote control is not necessarily hiding under the couch, but it does not provide any information about its location.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: No",
