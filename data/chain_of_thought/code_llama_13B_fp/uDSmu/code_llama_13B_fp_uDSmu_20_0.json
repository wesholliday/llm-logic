Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\n2. It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\n\nFrom the first piece of information, we can infer that the sunglasses are either in her bag or not in her bag. However, the second piece of information tells us that the sunglasses are not necessarily perched on her head, so we cannot infer that they are in her bag.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: no",
