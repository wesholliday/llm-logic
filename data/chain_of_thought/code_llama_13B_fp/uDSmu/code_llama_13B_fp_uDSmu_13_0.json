This means that the toy is either in the toy box or not in the toy box.\n\nSecond, we can see that it's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf. This means that the toy is not necessarily sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nNow, we can use the information provided to make an inference. If the toy is not in the toy box, then it must be sitting on the bookshelf. Therefore, if we assume that the toy is not in the toy box, we can infer that the toy is sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer that the toy is in the toy box without more information. Therefore, the answer is no, we cannot infer that the toy is in the toy box based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
