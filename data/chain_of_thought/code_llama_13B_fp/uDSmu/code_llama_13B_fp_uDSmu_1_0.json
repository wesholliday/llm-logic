It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that Fido is inside, we need to analyze the given information and determine whether it is possible to draw a conclusion based on the information provided.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first statement: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\" This statement implies that Fido is either inside or in the garden, but it does not provide any information about which one it is.\n\nNext, let's consider the second statement: \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" This statement implies that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not provide any information about whether Fido is inside or not.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information provided:\n\n1. Fido is either inside or in the garden.\n2. Fido is not in the garden.\n\nBased on the information provided, we cannot infer that Fido is inside. The only thing we can say is that Fido is not in the garden, but we don't know whether Fido is inside or not.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that Fido is inside.",
