Either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked.\n\nTo infer that the twonk is varnished, we need to analyze the given statements and determine whether they are logically consistent.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first statement: \"The twonk might not be plinked.\" This statement suggests that the twonk is not necessarily plinked, but it could be.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement: \"Either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked.\" This statement suggests that if the twonk is not varnished, it must be plinked.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that the twonk is not necessarily varnished, but it could be. Therefore, we cannot infer that the twonk is varnished based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
