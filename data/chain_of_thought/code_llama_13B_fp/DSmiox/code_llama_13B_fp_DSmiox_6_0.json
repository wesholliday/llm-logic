Either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped.\n\nTo infer that the grommet is sploffed, we need to analyze the given statements and determine whether they are logically consistent.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first statement: \"The grommet might not be plopped.\" This statement suggests that the grommet is not necessarily plopped, but it could be.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement: \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped.\" This statement suggests that the grommet is either sploffed or it must be plopped.\n\nIf we assume that the grommet is not necessarily plopped, as stated in the first statement, then we can conclude that the grommet is either sploffed or it must be plopped, as stated in the second statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
