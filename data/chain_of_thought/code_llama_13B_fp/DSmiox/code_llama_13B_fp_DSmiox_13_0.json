Either the glip is slogged or it must be tragged.\n\nTo infer that the glip is slogged, we need to use the information in a logical way.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possibility that the glip is not tragged. If the glip is not tragged, then it must be slogged, since the second statement says that either the glip is slogged or it must be tragged.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the glip is tragged. If the glip is tragged, then it is not slogged, since the first statement says that the glip might not be tragged.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
