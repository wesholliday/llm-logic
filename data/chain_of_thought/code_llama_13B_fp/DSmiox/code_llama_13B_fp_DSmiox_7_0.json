Either the whiffle is shanked or it must be tinked.\n\nTo infer that the whiffle is shanked, we need to analyze the statements and their logical relationships.\n\nThe first statement suggests that the whiffle might not be tinked, which means that it is possible that the whiffle is not tinked.\n\nThe second statement states that either the whiffle is shanked or it must be tinked. This means that if the whiffle is not shanked, it must be tinked.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications of these statements. If the whiffle is not tinked, then it must be shanked. Therefore, we can infer that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
