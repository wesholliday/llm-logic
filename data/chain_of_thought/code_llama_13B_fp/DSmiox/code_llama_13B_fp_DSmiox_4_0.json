Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked.\n\nTo infer that the fribble is snurgled, we need to use the given information to make a logical conclusion.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first statement: \"The fribble might not be crinked.\" This statement suggests that the fribble is not necessarily crinked, but it could be.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement: \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked.\" This statement suggests that if the fribble is not snurgled, then it must be crinked.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that if the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled. Therefore, we can infer that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
