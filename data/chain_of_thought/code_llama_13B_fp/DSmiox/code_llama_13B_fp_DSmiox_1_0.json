Either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled.\n\nTo infer that the flugel is blimmed, we need to apply the principle of non-contradiction. This means that we cannot infer that the flugel is blimmed if the first statement is false, as this would lead to a contradiction.\n\nHowever, the first statement is not necessarily false. It is possible that the flugel is not zargled, but this does not necessarily mean that it is blimmed. Therefore, we cannot infer that the flugel is blimmed from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
