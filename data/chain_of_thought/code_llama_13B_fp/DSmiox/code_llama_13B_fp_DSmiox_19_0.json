Either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged.\n\nTo infer that the smonk is vreebled, we need to use the information in a logical way. We can do this by using the principle of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time.\n\nIn this case, we have two statements:\n\n1. The smonk might not be plagged.\n2. Either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged.\n\nIf we assume that the smonk is not plagged, then we can conclude that it must be vreebled. This is because the second statement states that if the smonk is not plagged, then it must be vreebled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
