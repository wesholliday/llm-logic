Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the splat is morphed, we need to analyze the logical relationships between the statements.\n\nThe first statement suggests that the splat might not be quanked, which means that it is possible that the splat is not quanked.\n\nThe second statement, on the other hand, states that either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked. This means that if the splat is not morphed, it must be quanked.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications of these statements. If the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed, since the second statement states that if the splat is not morphed, it must be quanked. Therefore, we can infer that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
