The word \"and\" is used to connect the two characteristics, indicating that both are necessary conditions for the event. Therefore, if the event was formal and required tickets, it is reasonable to infer that it required tickets, as this is one of the two necessary conditions mentioned.\n\nAnswer: yes"
