            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The movie must have been in English and had subtitles\" implies that the movie had subtitles because it was in English. This is because English is a language that is often accompanied by subtitles in movies, especially when the dialogue is in English but the movie is intended for a non-English speaking audience or when the dialogue is fast-paced and hard to follow. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the movie had subtitles.\n\nAnswer: yes"
