            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the mummy was not awake from the given information, we need to carefully consider the relationships between the entities.\n\nThe first statement, \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake,\" suggests that there is a causal relationship between the two entities. In other words, if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake.\n\nThe second statement, \"The vampire was not awake,\" provides additional information about the vampire's state.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that the mummy was not awake. This is because the first statement suggests that the mummy is awake whenever the vampire is awake, and the second statement states that the vampire is not awake. Therefore, we can infer that the mummy is not awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
