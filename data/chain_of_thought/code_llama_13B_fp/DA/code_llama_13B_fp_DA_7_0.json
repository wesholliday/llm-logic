            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'Chris did not finish the race' from the given premises, we need to analyze the logical relationships between the statements.\n\nThe first premise, 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race,' is a conditional statement. It means that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have also finished the race.\n\nThe second premise, 'Alex did not finish the race,' is a statement that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of logic to determine whether we can infer 'Chris did not finish the race' from the given premises.\n\n1. If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race.\n\nThis is a logical consequence of the first premise. If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race, because the first premise states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\n2. Chris did not finish the race.\n\nThis is the conclusion we can draw from the first premise and the second premise. If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race, because the first premise states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'Chris did not finish the race' from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
