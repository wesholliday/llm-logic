            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt' from the given information, we need to analyze the logical relationships between the statements.\n\nThe first statement, 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt,' is a conditional statement. It means that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nThe second statement, 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt,' is a negative statement. It means that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationships between these two statements:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n2. Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, and therefore, Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
