            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the pants were not denim from the given information, we need to carefully consider the relationships between the different pieces of information.\n\nThe first piece of information is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'. This statement implies that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must be denim. However, this statement does not imply that if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants must not be denim.\n\nThe second piece of information is 'The shirt was not cotton'. This statement tells us that the shirt is not cotton.\n\nNow, we need to consider the relationships between the two pieces of information. If the shirt was not cotton, then it is not necessarily the case that the pants are not denim. There could be other factors that determine whether the pants are denim or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the pants were not denim from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
