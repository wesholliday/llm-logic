            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'The cat was not outside' from the given information, we need to analyze the logical relationships between the statements.\n\nThe first statement, 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside,' is a conditional statement. It means that if the dog was inside, then the cat must be outside. However, we are given the additional information that the dog was not inside.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the dog was not inside, and the cat was not outside. This is because the conditional statement only applies when the dog is inside, and since the dog was not inside, the cat was not outside either.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
