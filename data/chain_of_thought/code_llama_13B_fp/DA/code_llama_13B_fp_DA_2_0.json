            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'The unicorn was not in the forest' from the given premises, we need to examine the logical relationships between the statements.\n\nThe first premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was also in the forest. This is a conditional statement, which means that the conclusion (the unicorn was in the forest) only follows from the assumption (the griffin was in the forest) if the assumption is true.\n\nThe second premise states that the griffin was not in the forest. This is a negative statement, which means that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nNow, we need to apply the rules of logic to determine whether we can infer 'The unicorn was not in the forest' from the given premises.\n\nIf we assume that the griffin was in the forest, then we can conclude that the unicorn was also in the forest, since the first premise states that this is the case. However, since the griffin was not in the forest, we cannot conclude that the unicorn was in the forest, since the first premise only applies when the griffin is in the forest.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The unicorn was not in the forest' from the given premises, since the second premise contradicts the first premise.\n\nAnswer: No",
