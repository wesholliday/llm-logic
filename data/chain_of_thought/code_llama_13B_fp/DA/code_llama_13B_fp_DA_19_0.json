            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'Jen did not watch basketball' from the given information, we need to analyze the logical relationships between the statements.\n\nThe first statement, 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball,' is a conditional statement. It means that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nThe second statement, 'Tom did not watch football,' is a negative statement. It means that Tom did not watch football.\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of logical reasoning to determine whether we can infer 'Jen did not watch basketball' from the given information.\n\n1. If Tom did not watch football, then we cannot infer that Jen watched basketball.\n2. If Tom did not watch football, then we cannot infer that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Jen did not watch basketball' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
