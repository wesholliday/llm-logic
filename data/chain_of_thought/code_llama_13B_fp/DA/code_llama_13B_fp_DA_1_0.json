            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'Sue was not at the wedding' from the given premises, we need to examine the logical relationships between the statements.\n\nThe first premise, 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', is a conditional statement. It means that if Mary was at the wedding, then it is also the case that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nThe second premise, 'Mary was not at the wedding', is a statement of fact. It means that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nNow, we need to apply the rules of logic to determine whether we can infer 'Sue was not at the wedding' from the given premises.\n\nThe rule of logic that we need to apply here is the rule of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot both be true and false at the same time.\n\nIn this case, we have two statements: 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' and 'Mary was not at the wedding'. If we assume that the first statement is true, then it would follow that Sue was at the wedding. However, the second statement tells us that Mary was not at the wedding, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Sue was not at the wedding' from the given premises. The premises do not provide enough information to make such an inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
