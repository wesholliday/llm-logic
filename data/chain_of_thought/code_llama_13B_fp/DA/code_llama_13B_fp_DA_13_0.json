            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'The truck was not blue' from 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' together with 'The car was not red', we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement, 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue', is a conditional statement. It means that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. This statement is not necessarily true, as there may be other factors that affect the color of the truck.\n\nThe second statement, 'The car was not red', is a fact. It means that the car was not red.\n\nNow, we need to consider the logical relationship between these two statements. If the car was not red, then it is possible that the truck was not blue. However, we cannot infer that the truck was not blue from the first statement alone, as the first statement only states that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. It does not state that the truck was not blue if the car was not red.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The truck was not blue' from 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' together with 'The car was not red'.\n\nAnswer: No",
