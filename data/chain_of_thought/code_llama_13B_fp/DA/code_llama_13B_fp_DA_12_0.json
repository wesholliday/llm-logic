            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'Lucy did not go to the zoo' from the given information, we need to analyze the logical relationships between the statements.\n\nThe first statement, 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo,' is a conditional statement. It means that if Joe went to the park, then it is also true that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nThe second statement, 'Joe did not go to the park,' is a negative statement. It means that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationships between these two statements:\n\n1. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. (Conditional statement)\n2. Joe did not go to the park. (Negative statement)\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. However, since Joe did not go to the park, we cannot infer that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Lucy did not go to the zoo' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
