            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The room must have been cleaned daily' implies a mandatory or required cleaning schedule, without any flexibility or exceptions. The word 'must' suggests a necessity or obligation. In contrast, the phrase 'as requested' implies that the cleaning schedule is flexible and can be adjusted based on individual preferences or needs. Since the original statement does not provide any information about exceptions or flexibility, we cannot infer that the room must have been cleaned daily or as requested. The original statement is a more restrictive condition than the inferred statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
