However, it does not provide any information about the location of the bed itself. It does not specify whether the bed is upstairs or downstairs. Therefore, we cannot infer that the envelope is upstairs and under a bed, as the original statement does not provide any information about the location of the bed in relation to the floor.\n\nAnswer: no"
