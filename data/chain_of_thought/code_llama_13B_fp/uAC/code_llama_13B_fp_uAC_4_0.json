This means that if the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nThe second statement states that the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether the first statement is logically consistent with the second statement. If the first statement is logically consistent with the second statement, then we can infer that the alien visited Mars.\n\nTo determine whether the first statement is logically consistent with the second statement, we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement implies that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. This means that if the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nThe second statement states that the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nSince the second statement does not mention the alien, it does not provide any information about whether the alien visited Mars or not. Therefore, the first statement is logically consistent with the second statement, and we can infer that the alien visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
