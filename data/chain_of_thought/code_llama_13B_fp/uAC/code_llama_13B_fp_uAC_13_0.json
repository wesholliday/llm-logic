The truck was blue.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the car was red, we need to analyze the given information and determine whether it is logically consistent.\n\n1. If the car was red, then the truck was blue. This statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the premise (the car was red) is true.\n2. The truck was blue. This statement is a fact, which means that it is always true regardless of the premise.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. If the car was red, then the truck was blue. This statement is true, because if the car was red, then the truck must be blue.\n2. The truck was blue. This statement is true, because the truck was indeed blue.\n\nBased on the given information, we can conclude that the car was red. This is because the first statement is a conditional statement, and the second statement is a fact. Therefore, we can infer that the car was red based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
