It means that if the bear was in the cave, then it is also true that the wolf was in the den.\n\nThe statement \"The wolf was in the den\" is a fact. It is a statement that is true regardless of whether the bear was in the cave or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the bear was in the cave based solely on the information provided. We need more information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
