In this case, the first statement implies that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake. The second statement states that the mummy is awake.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that the mummy is awake. However, we cannot infer that the vampire is also awake based solely on the information provided. The first statement only implies that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake, but it does not provide any information about the vampire's state of awake-ness.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the vampire was awake based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
