This means that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nThe second statement states that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot infer that Mary was at the wedding. The first statement implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding, but the second statement only states that Sue was at the wedding. This means that we do not know whether Mary was at the wedding or not.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no, we cannot infer that Mary was at the wedding based on the given information.",
