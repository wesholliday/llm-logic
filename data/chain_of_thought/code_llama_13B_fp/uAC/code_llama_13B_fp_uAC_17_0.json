Kate ate salad.\n\nTo infer that Ben ate pasta, we need to use the information in a logical way. We can do this by using the principle of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time.\n\nIn this case, we have two statements:\n\n1. Ben ate pasta.\n2. Kate ate salad.\n\nIf we assume that Ben ate pasta, then we can conclude that Kate ate salad.
