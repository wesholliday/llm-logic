Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nTo infer that Joe went to the park, we need to use the information in a logical way. We can do this by using the principle of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time.\n\nIn this case, we have two statements:\n\n1. Joe went to the park.\n2. Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nIf we assume that Joe went to the park, then we can conclude that Lucy went to the zoo. This is because the second statement is a consequence of the first statement.\n\nHowever, we also have the third statement, which states that Lucy went to the zoo. This means that the second statement is true, and therefore the first statement is also true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Joe went to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
