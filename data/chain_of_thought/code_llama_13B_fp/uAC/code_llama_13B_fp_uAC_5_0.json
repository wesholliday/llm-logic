Amy played tennis.\n\nTo infer that Jeff played basketball, we need to use the given information to make a logical conclusion.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the condition (Jeff played basketball) is met.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement: \"Amy played tennis.\" This statement is a fact, which means that it is always true.\n\nSince the second statement is a fact, we can conclude that Amy played tennis. However, we still need to consider the first statement to determine whether Jeff played basketball.\n\nIf we assume that Jeff played basketball, then we can use the first statement to conclude that Amy played tennis. This means that the first statement is true, which means that Jeff played basketball.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Jeff played basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
