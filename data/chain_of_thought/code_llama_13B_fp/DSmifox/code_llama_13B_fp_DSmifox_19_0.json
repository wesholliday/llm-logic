Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled.\n\nTo infer that the smonk is vreebled, we need to use the information in the given statements to reach a conclusion.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first statement: \"The smonk might not be plagged.\" This statement suggests that the smonk is not necessarily plagged, but it could be.\n\nNext, let's look at the second statement: \"Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled.\" This statement suggests that if the smonk is not plagged, then it must be vreebled.\n\nNow, let's apply the information in these statements to reach a conclusion. If the smonk is not plagged, then it must be vreebled. Therefore, we can infer that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
