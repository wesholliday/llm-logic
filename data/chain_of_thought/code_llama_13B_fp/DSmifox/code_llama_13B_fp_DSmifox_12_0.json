Either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped.\n\nTo infer that the smip is shripped, we need to analyze the given statements and their logical relationships.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first statement: \"The smip might not be lupped.\" This statement implies that the smip is not necessarily lupped, but it could be.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement: \"Either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped.\" This statement implies that if the smip is not lupped, then it must be shripped.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that if the smip is not lupped, then it must be shripped. Therefore, we can infer that if the smip is not lupped, then it is shripped.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
