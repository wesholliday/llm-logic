Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed.\n\nTo infer that the splat is morphed, we need to analyze the logical relationships between the statements.\n\n1. The first statement suggests that the splat might not be quanked, which means that it is not necessarily quanked.\n2. The second statement states that either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed. This means that if the splat is not quanked, it must be morphed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the splat is morphed if we assume that the first statement is true. However, we cannot infer that the splat is morphed if we assume that the first statement is false.\n\nAnswer: No",
