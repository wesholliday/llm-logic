The second statement, \"Either the clug must be snugged or it is fleeked,\" implies that the clug must be snugged or it is fleeked. However, these two statements are contradictory, as the first statement implies that the clug is not necessarily snugged, while the second statement implies that the clug must be snugged. Therefore, we cannot infer that the clug is fleeked from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
