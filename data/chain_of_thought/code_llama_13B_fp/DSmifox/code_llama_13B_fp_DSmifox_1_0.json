Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed.\n\nTo infer that the flugel is blimmed, we need to apply the rules of logic. Specifically, we need to use the law of excluded middle, which states that for any proposition, either it is true or it is false.\n\nIn this case, we have two statements:\n\n1. The flugel might not be zargled.\n2. Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed.\n\nThe first statement implies that the flugel is not necessarily zargled, but it does not rule out the possibility that it is zargled. The second statement, on the other hand, implies that if the flugel is not zargled, then it is blimmed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the flugel is blimmed from the given statements. The law of excluded middle does not apply in this case, because the first statement does not rule out the possibility that the flugel is zargled.\n\nAnswer: No",
