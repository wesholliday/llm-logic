Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed.\n\nTo infer that the grommet is sploffed, we need to use the information in the given statements to reach a conclusion.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first statement: \"The grommet might not be plopped.\" This statement suggests that the grommet is not necessarily plopped, but it could be.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement: \"Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed.\" This statement suggests that if the grommet is not plopped, then it must be sploffed.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that if the grommet is not plopped, then it must be sploffed. Therefore, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
