Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged.\n\nTo infer that the glip is slogged, we need to use the law of excluded middle, which states that for any proposition, either it is true or it is false. In this case, we can infer that the glip is slogged if we assume that the glip is not tragged, since the second premise states that if the glip is not tragged, then it must be slogged.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer that the glip is slogged if we assume that the glip is tragged, since the second premise does not state that the glip must be slogged if it is tragged. Therefore, we cannot infer that the glip is slogged from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
