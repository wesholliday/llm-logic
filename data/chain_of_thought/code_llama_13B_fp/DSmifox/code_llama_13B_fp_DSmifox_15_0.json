This statement suggests that the dreb is not necessarily spened, but it could be.\n\nNext, let's look at the second premise, 'Either the dreb must be spened or it is vroombed'. This statement implies that if the dreb is not spened, then it is vroombed.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion, 'The dreb is vroombed'. This statement suggests that the dreb is definitely vroombed, which is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The dreb is vroombed' from 'The dreb might not be spened' together with 'Either the dreb must be spened or it is vroombed'.\n\nAnswer: No",
