Either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked.\n\nTo infer that the whiffle is shanked, we need to apply the rules of logic. Specifically, we need to use the law of excluded middle, which states that for any proposition, either it is true or it is false.\n\nIn this case, we have two options:\n\n1. The whiffle is tinked.\n2. The whiffle is shanked.\n\nIf we assume that the whiffle is not tinked, then we can conclude that it must be shanked. This is because the second statement states that either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked, and since we have already ruled out the possibility that it is tinked, the only remaining option is that it is shanked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
