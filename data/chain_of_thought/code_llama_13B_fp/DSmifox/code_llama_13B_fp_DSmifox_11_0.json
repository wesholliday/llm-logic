Either the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed.\n\nTo infer that the flug is blummed, we need to use the information in the given statements to reach a conclusion.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first statement: \"The flug might not be zimmed.\" This statement suggests that the flug is not necessarily zimmed, but it could be.\n\nNext, let's look at the second statement: \"Either the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed.\" This statement suggests that if the flug is not zimmed, then it must be blummed.\n\nNow, let's apply the information from the first statement to the second statement. If the flug is not zimmed, then it must be blummed, as stated in the second statement. Therefore, we can infer that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
