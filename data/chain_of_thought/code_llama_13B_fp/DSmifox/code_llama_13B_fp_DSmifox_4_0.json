This means that the fribble could be either crinked or not crinked.\n\nThe second statement, 'Either the fribble must be crinked or it is snurgled,' implies that if the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled. This means that if the fribble is not crinked, then it is either crinked or snurgled.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of these statements. If the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled. However, if the fribble is not crinked, then it could also be not snurgled. Therefore, we cannot infer that the fribble is snurgled from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
