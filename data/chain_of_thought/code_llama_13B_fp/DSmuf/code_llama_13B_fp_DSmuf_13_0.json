This implies that the toy is not necessarily in the toy box, but it could be either there or on the bookshelf.\n\nThe second statement, \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" suggests that the toy is not necessarily sitting on the bookshelf. This implies that the toy could be in the toy box or on the bookshelf, but it is not necessarily sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot infer that the toy is in the toy box. The toy could be either in the toy box or on the bookshelf, but we do not know for sure which one it is. Therefore, the answer is no.",
