This implies that the notebook is not necessarily sitting on the nightstand, but it could be in the drawer.\n\nThe second statement, \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand,\" suggests that the notebook is not necessarily sitting on the nightstand. This implies that the notebook could be in the drawer or somewhere else.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot infer that the notebook is in the drawer. The notebook could be sitting on the nightstand or somewhere else. Therefore, the answer is no.",
