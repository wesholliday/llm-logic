            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the book is on the shelf, we need to analyze the given information and the logical relationships between them.\n\nThe first statement, \"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf,\" suggests that the book is either resting on the table or on the shelf. This implies that the book is not resting on the table, as the alternative is that it is on the shelf.\n\nThe second statement, \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" suggests that the book is not resting on the table. This is because the statement \"the book must be resting on the table\" is a contradiction to the fact that the book is not resting on the table.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can infer that the book is on the shelf. This is because the first statement suggests that the book is either resting on the table or on the shelf, and the second statement rules out the possibility that the book is resting on the table. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
