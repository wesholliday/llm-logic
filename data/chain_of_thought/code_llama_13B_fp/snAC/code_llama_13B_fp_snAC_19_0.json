In this case, the antecedent is \"Tom watched football.\"\n\nThe statement \"Jen watched basketball\" is also true.\n\nTo determine whether \"Tom watched football\" is true, we need to consider the truth of the antecedent and the consequent of the conditional statement. If the antecedent is true and the consequent is true, then the conditional statement is true.\n\nIn this case, the antecedent is true (Tom watched football), and the consequent is also true (Jen watched basketball). Therefore, the conditional statement is true, and we can conclude that \"Tom watched football\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
