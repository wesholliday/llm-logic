In this case, the antecedent is false, so the conditional statement is also false.\n\nThe statement \"The truck was metal\" is true, but this does not necessarily mean that the doll was plastic. The two statements are unrelated, and it is possible that the truck was metal and the doll was not plastic.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that \"The doll was plastic\" is true.\n\nAnswer: No",
