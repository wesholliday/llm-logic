In this case, the antecedent is \"Alex finished the race.\"\n\nThe statement \"Chris finished the race\" is also true.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that \"Alex finished the race\" is true. The reason is that the conditional statement only implies that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. It does not say anything about the converse, which is that if Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that \"Alex finished the race\" is true based solely on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No",
