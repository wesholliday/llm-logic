'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta'\n2. 'Bob chose pasta'\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n'Sue chose pizza'\n\nWe can use a logical argument to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises. The argument is:\n\n1. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta (premise 1)\n2. Bob chose pasta (premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Sue chose pizza (conclusion)\n\nThe argument is valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, so the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
