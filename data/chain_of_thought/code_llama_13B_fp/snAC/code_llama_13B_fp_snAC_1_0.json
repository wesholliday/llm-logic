            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether 'Mary was at the wedding' is true, we need to examine the premises and the conclusion. The first premise states that 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.' This means that if Mary was at the wedding, then it is also true that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nThe second premise states that 'Sue was at the wedding.' This means that Sue was indeed at the wedding.\n\nNow, we need to consider the conclusion. The conclusion is that 'Mary was at the wedding.' This means that we need to determine whether it is true that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nTo determine whether the conclusion is true, we need to examine the premises and see if they logically entail the conclusion. In this case, the first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. Since we know that Sue was at the wedding, we can conclude that if Mary was at the wedding, then it is also true that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nHowever, we do not know whether Mary was at the wedding or not. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that Mary was at the wedding based solely on the premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
