In this case, the antecedent is \"The cake was chocolate.\"\n\nThe statement \"The muffins were blueberry\" is also true.\n\nTo determine whether \"The cake was chocolate\" is true, we need to look at the conditional statement and see if the antecedent is true. In this case, the antecedent is \"The cake was chocolate,\" and it is true.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that \"The cake was chocolate\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
