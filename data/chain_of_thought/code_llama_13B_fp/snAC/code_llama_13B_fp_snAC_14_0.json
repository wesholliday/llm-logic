'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den'\n2. 'The wolf was in the den'\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n1. 'The bear was in the cave'\n\nTo determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises, we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion. In this case, the conclusion follows from the premises if the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises.\n\nTo determine whether the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises, we need to evaluate the logical form of the premises and the conclusion. In this case, the premises are in the form of an if-then statement, and the conclusion is a statement about the bear being in the cave.\n\nTo determine whether the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises. In this case, the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises if the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion 'The bear was in the cave' follows from the premises 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den' and 'The wolf was in the den'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
