In this case, the antecedent is \"Joe went to the park,\" and the consequent is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nIf we know that \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is true, then we can conclude that the antecedent must also be true. However, we don't know for sure whether \"Joe went to the park\" is true or not.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"no.\" It does not necessarily follow that \"Joe went to the park\" is true, even if we know that \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is true and \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is true.",
