We know that the conditional statement is true, and we also know that 'The pants were denim' is true. However, we don't know whether 'The shirt was cotton' is true or not.\n\nTo determine whether 'The shirt was cotton' is true, we need to evaluate the antecedent and consequent of the conditional statement. The antecedent is 'The shirt was cotton,' and the consequent is 'The pants were denim.' If the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true. However, we don't know whether the antecedent is true or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude whether 'The shirt was cotton' is true or not based solely on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No",
