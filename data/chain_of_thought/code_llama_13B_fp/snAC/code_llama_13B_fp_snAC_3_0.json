'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel'\n2. 'The book is a mystery novel'\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n3. 'The book was written by James'\n\nTo determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises, we need to evaluate whether the premises are sufficient to establish the conclusion.\n\nPremise 1: 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel'\n\nThis premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the 'then') is true. In this case, the antecedent is 'The book was written by James', and the consequent is 'The book is a mystery novel'.\n\nPremise 2: 'The book is a mystery novel'\n\nThis premise is a statement of fact, which means that it is true regardless of whether the antecedent is true or not.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate whether the premises are sufficient to establish the conclusion. In other words, we need to determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nTo establish the conclusion, we need to show that the antecedent of the conditional statement in premise 1 is true. In this case, the antecedent is 'The book was written by James'.\n\nHowever, we are not given any information about who wrote the book, so we cannot determine whether this antecedent is true or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the book was written by James.\n\nAnswer: No",
