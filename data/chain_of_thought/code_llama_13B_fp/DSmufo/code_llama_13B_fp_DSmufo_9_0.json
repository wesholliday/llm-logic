Either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\n\nTo infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box, we need to assume that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor. This is because the second premise states that either the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor or it is in the box. If the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor, then it must be in the box.\n\nHowever, the first premise states that it is not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor. This means that the missing puzzle piece is not necessarily blending in on the floor, and we cannot infer that it is in the box based solely on this premise.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
