The first premise states that it is not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf. This means that the toy is not necessarily sitting on the bookshelf. The second premise states that either the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box. This means that if the toy is not sitting on the bookshelf, it must be in the toy box.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
