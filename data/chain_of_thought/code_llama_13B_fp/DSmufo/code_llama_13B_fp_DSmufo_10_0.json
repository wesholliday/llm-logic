Either the missing sock must be under the bed or it's in the laundry basket.\n\nTo infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket, we need to assume that the missing sock is not under the bed. This is because the second premise states that either the missing sock is under the bed or it's in the laundry basket. If the missing sock is under the bed, then the second premise is not true, and we cannot infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket if we assume that the missing sock is not under the bed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
