            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the book is on the shelf, we need to analyze the given information and the logical relationships between them.\n\nThe first statement, \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" means that the book is not necessarily resting on the table. This statement is a negation of the second statement, \"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf.\"\n\nThe second statement, \"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf,\" is a disjunction of two statements. The first statement, \"The book must be resting on the table,\" means that the book is resting on the table. The second statement, \"The book is on the shelf,\" means that the book is not resting on the table but is on the shelf.\n\nSince the first statement is a negation of the second statement, we can conclude that the book is not necessarily resting on the table. Therefore, we cannot infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: No",
