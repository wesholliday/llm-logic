We can't infer that the umbrella is in the car based solely on the fact that it is not tucked away in the closet.\n\nFor example, imagine a scenario where the umbrella is not in the car, but it is not tucked away in the closet either. In this case, we would not be able to infer that the umbrella is in the car based solely on the information provided.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the umbrella is in the car from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
