The first premise states that it is not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack. This means that the scarf is not necessarily draped on the coat rack, but it could be stuffed in my backpack instead.\n\nThe second premise states that either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack. This means that if the scarf is not draped on the coat rack, then it must be stuffed in my backpack.\n\nUsing these two premises, we can conclude that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
