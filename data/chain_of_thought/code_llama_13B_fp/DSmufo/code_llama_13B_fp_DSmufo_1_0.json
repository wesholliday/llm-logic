            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'Fido is inside' from the given premises, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument. The argument is based on a conditional statement, which is a statement of the form \"if P, then Q.\" In this case, the premises are:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n2. \"Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside.\"\n\nThe conclusion is \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nThe first premise states that Fido is not necessarily in the garden. This means that Fido could be inside or outside the garden. The second premise states that either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside. This means that if Fido is not in the garden, then Fido must be inside.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Fido is inside from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
