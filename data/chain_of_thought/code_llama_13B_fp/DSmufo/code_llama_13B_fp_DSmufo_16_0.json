The argument is based on a conditional statement, which is a statement of the form \"if P then Q.\" In this case, the premises are:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\"\n2. \"Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag.\"\n\nThe conclusion is \"The pen is in my bag.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer the conclusion from the premises, we need to analyze the validity of the argument. The argument is valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the argument is valid if the conclusion is true whenever the premises are true.\n\nTo determine whether the conclusion is true whenever the premises are true, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument.
