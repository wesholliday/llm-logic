Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\n\nTo infer that Fido is inside, we need to use the information in the premises to reach a conclusion. The first premise tells us that Fido is not necessarily in the garden, but it does not tell us anything about whether Fido is inside or not. The second premise tells us that Fido is either inside or in the garden, but it does not tell us which one it is.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Fido is inside based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
