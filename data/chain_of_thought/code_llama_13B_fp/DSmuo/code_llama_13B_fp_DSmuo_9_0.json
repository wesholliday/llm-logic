Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor.\n\nTo infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box, we need to show that the only possible conclusion that can be drawn from these premises is that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nOne way to do this is to assume that the missing puzzle piece is not in the box, and then show that this assumption leads to a contradiction. If the missing puzzle piece is not in the box, then it must be blending in on the floor, which contradicts the first premise. Therefore, we can conclude that the missing puzzle piece must be in the box.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
