The first premise states that it is not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf. This means that the toy is not necessarily sitting on the bookshelf, but it could be in the toy box or somewhere else.\n\nThe second premise states that either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf. This means that if the toy is not in the toy box, then it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nBased on the information provided, we cannot infer that the toy is in the toy box. The toy could be in the toy box or it could be sitting on the bookshelf, but we do not know for sure which one it is.\n\nAnswer: No",
