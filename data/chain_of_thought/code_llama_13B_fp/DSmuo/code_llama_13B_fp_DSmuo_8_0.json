This means that the remote control is either on the coffee table or somewhere else.\n\nThe second premise states that either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch. This means that if the remote control is not on the coffee table, then it must be hiding under the couch.\n\nBased on these premises, we can conclude that the remote control is either on the coffee table or hiding under the couch. However, we are not given any information about the remote control's location, so we cannot infer that it is on the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no, we cannot infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.",
