The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" implies that the remote control is either on the coffee table or under the couch, but it does not rule out the possibility that it is not under the couch. The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" also does not provide any additional information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the remote control is on the coffee table based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
