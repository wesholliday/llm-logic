This statement is a simple conditional statement that does not contain any logical operators or quantifiers.\n\nThe second statement, 'If the zibble is zapped and the quib is squinked, then the glorp will zoon', is a compound conditional statement that combines two conditional statements. This statement is a complex conditional statement that contains a logical operator (the conjunction 'and') and a quantifier (the word 'both').\n\nTo determine whether we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. In this case, the first statement is a simple conditional statement that does not contain any logical operators or quantifiers, while the second statement is a compound conditional statement that combines two conditional statements.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first, as the second statement contains a logical operator and a quantifier that are not present in the first statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
