It states that if the flugel was blimmed, then it was also zargled. However, this statement does not necessarily imply that if the flugel was not blimmed, then it was not zargled.\n\nIn other words, the statement \"If the flugel was not blimmed, then the flugel was not zargled\" is not necessarily true, as there may be other factors that affect whether or not the flugel is zargled.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no. We cannot infer that \"If the flugel was not blimmed, then the flugel was not zargled\" from the given statement.",
