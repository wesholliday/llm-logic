However, the converse of this implication (if the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk was not plagged) is not necessarily true.\n\nIn other words, just because the smonk was not vreebled, it does not necessarily mean that it was not plagged. There could be other reasons why the smonk was not plagged, such as it was not in a position to be plagged or it was not affected by the vreebling.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk was not plagged.\n\nAnswer: No",
