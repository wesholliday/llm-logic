However, the converse of this implication (if the clug was not fleeked, then the clug was not snugged) is not necessarily true.\n\nIn other words, just because the clug was not fleeked, it does not necessarily mean that it was not snugged. There could be other reasons why the clug was not snugged, such as the clug was not in a position to be snugged or the clug was not able to be snugged due to some other factor.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the clug was not fleeked, then the clug was not snugged.\n\nAnswer: No",
