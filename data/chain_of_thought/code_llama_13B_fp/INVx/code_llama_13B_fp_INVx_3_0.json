However, the statement does not provide any information about the relationship between the splat and the concept of morphing or quanking.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank\" from the given statement. The statement does not provide any information about the relationship between the splat and the concept of morphing or quanking, so we cannot make any conclusions about the splat's behavior based on the assumption that it was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: No",
