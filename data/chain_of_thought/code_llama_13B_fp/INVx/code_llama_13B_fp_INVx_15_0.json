In this case, the premise is \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\" This means that if the dreb was vroombed, then it was also spened.\n\nHowever, the question asks us to infer whether the following statement is also true: \"If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened.\" This is a different statement, and it is not necessarily true based on the given premise.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no, we cannot infer that \"If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened\" from the given premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
