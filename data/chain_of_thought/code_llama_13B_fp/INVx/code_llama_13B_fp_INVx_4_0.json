In this case, the antecedent is \"the fribble was snurgled,\" and the consequent is \"the fribble crinked.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"If the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink,\" we need to consider the truth of the antecedent and the consequent. If the antecedent is false (i.e., the fribble was not snurgled), then the implication is true regardless of the truth of the consequent. In other words, if the fribble was not snurgled, then it is not necessarily the case that the fribble did not crink.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
