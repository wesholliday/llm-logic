It means that if the smip was shripped, then the smip did lup the zoint. However, the statement does not say what happens if the smip was not shripped.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If the smip was not shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint\" from the given statement. The statement does not provide enough information to make such an inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
