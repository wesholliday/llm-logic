However, the converse of this implication (if the shank was not plooked, then the shank was not nugged) is not necessarily true.\n\nIn other words, just because the shank was not plooked, it does not necessarily mean that it was not nugged. There could be other reasons why the shank was not nugged, such as it was not in the correct position or it was not properly secured.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that 'If the shank was not plooked, then the shank was not nugged' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
