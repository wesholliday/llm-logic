In this case, the statement is \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\" This means that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have surned.\n\nTo infer the opposite of this statement, we need to reverse the relationship between the two events or states. In this case, we can infer that \"If the fleeg was not bluttered, then it did not surn.\" This is because if the fleeg was not bluttered, then it did not surn.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes. We can infer the opposite of the given statement by reversing the relationship between the two events or states.",
