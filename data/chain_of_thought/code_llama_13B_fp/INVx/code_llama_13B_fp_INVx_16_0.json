            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\" is a logical statement that uses the concept of implication. It states that if the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink. However, this statement does not necessarily imply that if the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink.\n\nTo see why, consider the following counterexample:\n\nSuppose that the sneg was not crampled, but it still sproted the frink. In this case, the statement \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\" is false, because the sneg was not crampled, but it still sproted the frink. However, the statement \"If the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink\" is also false, because the sneg did sprot the frink, even though it was not crampled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink\" from the statement \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\".\n\nAnswer: No",
