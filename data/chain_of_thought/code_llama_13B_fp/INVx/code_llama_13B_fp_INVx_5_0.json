It is a type of ad hominem argument that relies on a false assumption and is used to attack the character of an opponent rather than addressing the issue at hand.\n\nIn this case, the statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\" is a false assumption because it is not a valid conclusion based on the given information. The statement does not provide enough information to make a conclusion about the zinger's state of being smoogled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the zinger was not fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
