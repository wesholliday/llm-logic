It states that if the sprocket was cranked, then it was also daggled. However, this statement does not necessarily imply that if the sprocket was not cranked, then it was not daggled.\n\nIn other words, the statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" does not provide enough information to determine whether the sprocket was daggled if it was not cranked. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If the sprocket was not cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled\" from this statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
