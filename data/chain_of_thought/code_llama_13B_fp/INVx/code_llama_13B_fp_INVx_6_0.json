            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" is a logical statement that is based on the assumption that the grommet was sploffed. However, this statement does not necessarily imply that the grommet did not plop the frink if it was not sploffed.\n\nIn order to determine whether the statement \"If the grommet was not sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink\" is logically equivalent to the original statement, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe original statement is a conditional statement that has the form \"if P, then Q.\" In this case, P is the statement \"the grommet was sploffed\" and Q is the statement \"the grommet plopped the frink.\"\n\nThe statement \"If the grommet was not sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink\" is also a conditional statement that has the form \"if P, then Q.\" In this case, P is the statement \"the grommet was not sploffed\" and Q is the statement \"the grommet did not plop the frink.\"\n\nTo determine whether these two statements are logically equivalent, we need to analyze the truth tables for each statement.\n\nTruth Table for the Original Statement:\n\n| P (Grommet was sploffed) | Q (Grommet plopped the frink) |\n| --- | --- |\n| True | True |\n| False | False |\n\nTruth Table for the Inferred Statement:\n\n| P (Grommet was not sploffed) | Q (Grommet did not plop the frink) |\n| --- | --- |\n| True | True |\n| False | False |\n\nAs we can see, the truth tables for the two statements are identical, which means that they are logically equivalent. Therefore, we can infer that \"If the grommet was not sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink\" is a logically equivalent statement to \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
