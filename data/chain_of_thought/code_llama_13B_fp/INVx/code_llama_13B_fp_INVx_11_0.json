In this case, the premise is \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\" This means that if the flug was blummed, then it was also zimmed.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"If the flug was not blummed, then the flug was not zimmed\" from the given statement, we need to consider the possibility that the flug was not blummed. If the flug was not blummed, then it is not necessarily true that it was zimmed. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If the flug was not blummed, then the flug was not zimmed\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
