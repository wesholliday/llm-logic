However, the converse of this implication (if the glip was not slogged, then the glip was not tragged) is not necessarily true.\n\nIn other words, just because the glip was not slogged, it does not necessarily mean that it was not tragged. There could be other reasons why the glip was not tragged, such as it was not in a position to be tragged or it was not in a state of being tragged.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the glip was not slogged, then it was not tragged.\n\nAnswer: No",
