In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premises and conclusion and determine whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. This means that if the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.\n\nThe second premise states that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nThe conclusion states that the wolf was not in the den.\n\nIf the first premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true. However, the second premise states that the bear was not in the cave, which contradicts the first premise. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premises, and the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
