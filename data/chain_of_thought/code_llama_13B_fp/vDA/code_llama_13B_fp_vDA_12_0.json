            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\" and the premises are \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" and \"Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the validity of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. The first premise \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is a conditional statement. This means that the conclusion \"Lucy went to the zoo\" logically follows from the premise \"Joe went to the park.\"\n2. The second premise \"Joe did not go to the park\" is a statement of fact. This means that the premise \"Joe did not go to the park\" is true.\n3. The conclusion \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\" is a statement of fact. This means that the conclusion \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\" is either true or false.\n\nNow, let's examine the validity of the argument:\n\n1. If the first premise is true, then the conclusion is logically valid.\n2. If the second premise is true, then the conclusion is logically valid.\n3. If both premises are true, then the conclusion is logically valid.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid if both premises are true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
