In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. In this case, the first premise states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. The second premise states that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nIf we assume that the first premise is true, then we can conclude that Erin did not take a train. However, the second premise states that Sam did not take a plane, which contradicts the first premise. Therefore, the argument is logically invalid.\n\nAnswer: No",
