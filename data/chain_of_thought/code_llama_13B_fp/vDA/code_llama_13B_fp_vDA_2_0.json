In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premises and the conclusion. The first premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was also in the forest. This means that if the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nThe second premise states that the griffin was not in the forest. Therefore, based on the first premise, we can conclude that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nThe conclusion states that the unicorn was not in the forest. This is the same as the conclusion we reached based on the first premise, so the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
