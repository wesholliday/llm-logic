In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. In this case, the first premise states that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. The second premise states that Ben did not eat pasta. The conclusion states that Kate did not eat salad.\n\nThe problem with this argument is that the first premise is not logically consistent with the second premise. If Ben did not eat pasta, then it is not necessarily the case that Kate ate salad. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premises, and the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
