            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is 'Bob did not choose pasta', and the premises are 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta' and 'Sue did not choose pizza'.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the validity of each premise and the conclusion.\n\nPremise 1: 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta'\n\nThis premise is logically valid because it is a conditional statement that is based on a true premise. The antecedent (the 'if' part) is 'Sue chose pizza', which is a possible event. The consequent (the 'then' part) is 'Bob chose pasta', which is also a possible event. Therefore, the premise is logically valid.\n\nPremise 2: 'Sue did not choose pizza'\n\nThis premise is also logically valid because it is a statement of fact. Sue did not choose pizza, and this is a known fact.\n\nConclusion: 'Bob did not choose pasta'\n\nThe conclusion is logically valid if it logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion logically follows from the premises because the first premise states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. Since Sue did not choose pizza, the first premise is false, and therefore the conclusion that Bob did not choose pasta is also false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
