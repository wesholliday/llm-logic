            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is \"The cat was not outside\" and the premises are \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" and \"The dog was not inside.\"\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the validity of each premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. The first premise \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" is a conditional statement. This means that the conclusion \"The cat was outside\" logically follows from the premise \"The dog was inside.\"\n2. The second premise \"The dog was not inside\" is a negative statement. This means that the premise \"The dog was inside\" is false.\n3. The conclusion \"The cat was not outside\" is a negative statement. This means that the conclusion \"The cat was outside\" is false.\n\nSince the first premise logically follows from the second premise, and the second premise is false, the conclusion is also false. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
