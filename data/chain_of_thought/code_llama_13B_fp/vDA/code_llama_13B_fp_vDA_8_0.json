In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premises and the conclusion.\n\nPremise 1: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\nPremise 2: The vampire was not awake.\nConclusion: The mummy was not awake.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises if we assume that the vampire and the mummy are the same person. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake, and if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
