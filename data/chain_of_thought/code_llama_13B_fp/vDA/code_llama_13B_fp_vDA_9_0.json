            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt,\" and the premises are \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" and \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion. In this case, the conclusion logically follows from the premises if we assume that the premises are true.\n\nThe first premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This means that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This is a logical implication, which means that if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nThe second premise states that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This means that the first premise is true, and therefore the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
