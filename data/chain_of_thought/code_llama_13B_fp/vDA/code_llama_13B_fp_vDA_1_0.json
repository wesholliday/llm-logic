            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it is a valid syllogism. The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the 'then') is true. In this case, the antecedent is 'Mary was at the wedding', and the consequent is 'Sue was at the wedding'. The second premise is a negation of the first premise, which means that it is only true if the first premise is false. In this case, the second premise is 'Mary was not at the wedding', which means that the first premise is false. Therefore, the conclusion 'Sue was not at the wedding' is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
