In this case, the conclusion is \"The banana was not yellow\" and the premises are \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" and \"The apple was not red.\"\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. In this case, the conclusion is a negation of the second premise, which is a negation of the first premise. This means that the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
