Therefore, some A are not B.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel', which is a universal affirmative statement. The second premise is 'The book was not written by James', which is a universal negative statement. The conclusion is 'The book is not a mystery novel', which is a universal negative statement.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows logically from the premises. The first premise states that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. The second premise states that the book was not written by James. Therefore, the conclusion follows that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
