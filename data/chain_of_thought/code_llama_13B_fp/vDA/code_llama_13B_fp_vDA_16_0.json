In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premises and the conclusion.\n\nPremise 1: If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\nPremise 2: The shirt was not cotton.\nConclusion: The pants were not denim.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises if we assume that the premises are true. In other words, if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
