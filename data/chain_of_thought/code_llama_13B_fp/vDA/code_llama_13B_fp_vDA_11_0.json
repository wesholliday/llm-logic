            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premises and conclusion and determine whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. This means that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nThe second premise states that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nThe conclusion states that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In other words, we need to determine whether the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises.\n\nIf the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry. This is a logical consequence of the first premise.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
