            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is 'The snork might be plonk'. This statement is in the form of a conditional sentence, where 'might be' indicates a possibility. The word 'or' is not present in the given statement, but it is a common way to extend a conditional sentence to include an alternative possibility. In this case, the alternative possibility is 'wobble'. Therefore, we can infer that 'The snork might be plonk or wobble' is a logical extension of the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
