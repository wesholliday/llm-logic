    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it\u2019s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn\u2019t get the offer, then if Priya doesn\u2019t, Diego will. Moreover, it\u2019s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn\u2019t get the offer, Diego will?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe reasoning behind this conclusion is based on the assumption that the hiring manager thinks it's most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. This means that the hiring manager is more likely to offer the role to Priya than to Julian, and less likely to offer it to Diego.\n\nIf Julian doesn't get the offer, then it's likely that Priya will get the role, as the hiring manager is more likely to offer it to Priya than to Julian. This means that if Priya doesn't get the offer, it's likely that Diego will get it, as the hiring manager is less likely to offer the role to Diego than to Priya.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
