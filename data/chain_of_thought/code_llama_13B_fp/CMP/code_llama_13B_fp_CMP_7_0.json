    "user_prompt": "Suppose that tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources. Forecasts indicate it\u2019s likely tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. These are the only major sources, so if solar power doesn\u2019t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn\u2019t, wind power will. Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe question is based on the assumption that tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources, and that forecasts indicate that tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. The question then asks whether it follows that if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the logical relationships between the statements. The first statement is that tidal power is likely to generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. The second statement is that if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will.\n\nThe logical relationship between these two statements is that if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, then wind power will generate the most electricity. This is because wind power is the only source that is not mentioned in the first statement, and hence it is the only source that could potentially generate the most electricity if tidal power doesn't.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is yes. It does follow that if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will.",
