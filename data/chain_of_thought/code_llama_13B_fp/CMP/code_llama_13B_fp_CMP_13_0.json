    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe reasoning behind this statement is based on the assumption that the states with the strongest job growth are Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri. The statement also assumes that Tennessee is likely to add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, and that Missouri's growth is significantly lower.\n\nThe conclusion drawn from this is that if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, then it's likely that Missouri will. This is because if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, then Georgia likely won't either, and since Missouri's growth is significantly lower than Tennessee's and Georgia's, it's likely to add the most jobs.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
