            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that expresses a relationship between two events. The statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" can be written as \"Jeff played basketball implies Amy played tennis.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that \"if Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball,\" we need to analyze the relationship between the two events. In this case, the relationship is a conditional one, which means that the second event (Amy playing tennis) is a consequence of the first event (Jeff playing basketball).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"if Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball\" because the first event (Jeff playing basketball) is a necessary condition for the second event (Amy playing tennis) to occur.\n\nAnswer: yes",
