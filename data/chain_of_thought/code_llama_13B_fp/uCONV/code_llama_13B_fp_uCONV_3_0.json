To answer this question, we need to consider the information provided in the question.\n\nThe question states that the book was written by James, but it does not mention anything about the book being a mystery novel. Therefore, we cannot infer that the book is a mystery novel based solely on the fact that it was written by James.\n\nIn order to make an inference that the book is a mystery novel, we would need to know more information about the book. For example, if the book is titled \"The Mysterious Case of the Missing Heirloom\" or \"The James Bond Mystery,\" then we could infer that the book is a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: No",
