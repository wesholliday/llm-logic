The vampire and the mummy are both undead creatures, but they have different characteristics and abilities. The vampire is a blood-sucking creature that can only survive in the presence of a living host, while the mummy is a human body that has been preserved through mummification.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to infer that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake. The vampire and the mummy are two separate entities with different characteristics and abilities, and they cannot be compared or inferred based on their shared undead status.\n\nAnswer: no",
