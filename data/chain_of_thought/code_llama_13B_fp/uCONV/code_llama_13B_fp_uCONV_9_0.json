The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a logical consequence of the information provided, but it does not necessarily follow that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nIn other words, the statement \"If A, then B\" does not imply that \"If B, then A\". This is known as a logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is no.",
