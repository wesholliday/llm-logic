In this case, the premise is \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" The conclusion is \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the conclusion is true, we need to analyze the premise. The premise is a logical implication, which means that it is a statement that is true if and only if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true and the consequent (the part after the \"then\") is also true.\n\nIn this case, the antecedent is \"Alex finished the race\" and the consequent is \"Chris finished the race.\" If the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true. However, if the antecedent is false, then the consequent may or may not be true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the conclusion is true based solely on the premise. The conclusion may or may not be true, depending on the truth value of the antecedent.\n\nAnswer: No",
