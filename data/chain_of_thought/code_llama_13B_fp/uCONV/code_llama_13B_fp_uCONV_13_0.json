This statement is not a logical equivalence, which means that it does not necessarily follow that if the truck was blue, then the car was red.\n\nIn order to determine whether we can infer that if the truck was blue, then the car was red, we need to consider the context in which the statement was made. If the statement was made in a context where the color of the car and the color of the truck were both known, then we can infer that if the truck was blue, then the car was red. However, if the statement was made in a context where the color of the car and the color of the truck were not known, then we cannot infer that if the truck was blue, then the car was red.\n\nAnswer: No",
