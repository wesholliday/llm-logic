The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is not logically equivalent to \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic.\" This is because the first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the premise (the doll was plastic) is true. However, the second statement is a logical implication, which means that it is always true, regardless of whether the premise is true or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic. The two statements are not equivalent, and we cannot make a logical conclusion based on the first statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
