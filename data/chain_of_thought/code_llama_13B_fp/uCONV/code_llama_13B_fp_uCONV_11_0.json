The statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is a logical fallacy known as a non-sequitur. This means that the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nIn other words, just because the cake was chocolate does not mean that the muffins were blueberry. There are many other possibilities, such as the muffins being strawberry or banana, that do not depend on the color of the cake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate.\n\nAnswer: No",
