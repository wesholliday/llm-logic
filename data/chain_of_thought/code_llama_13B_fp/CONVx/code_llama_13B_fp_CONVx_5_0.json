The statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\" implies that if the zinger was fraggled, then it was also smoogled. However, the statement \"If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was fraggled\" implies that if the zinger was smoogled, then it was also fraggled. This creates a logical contradiction, as it is not possible for the zinger to be both fraggled and smoogled at the same time.\n\nAnswer: No",
