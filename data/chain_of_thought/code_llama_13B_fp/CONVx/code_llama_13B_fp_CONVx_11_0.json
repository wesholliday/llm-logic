The statement \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed\" implies that if the flug was blummed, then it was also zimmed. However, the statement \"If the flug was zimmed, then the flug was blummed\" implies that if the flug was zimmed, then it was also blummed. Since these two statements are contradictory, we cannot infer that \"If the flug was zimmed, then the flug was blummed\" is true.\n\nAnswer: No",
