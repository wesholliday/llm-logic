The statement \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\" implies that if the dreb was vroombed, then it was also spened. However, the statement \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was vroombed\" implies that if the dreb was spened, then it was also vroombed. These two statements are contradictory, which means that it is not possible for both statements to be true at the same time.\n\nAnswer: No",
