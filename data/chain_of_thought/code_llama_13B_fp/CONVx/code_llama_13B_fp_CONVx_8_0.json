            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" is a logical statement that uses the word \"then\" to indicate a cause-and-effect relationship between the two events. The statement is saying that if the sprocket was cranked, then it was also daggled.\n\nHowever, the statement \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was cranked\" is not logically equivalent to the first statement. This statement is saying that if the sprocket was daggled, then it was also cranked. This is not necessarily true, as there could be other reasons why the sprocket was daggled, such as it was not cranked at all.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was cranked\" from the first statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
