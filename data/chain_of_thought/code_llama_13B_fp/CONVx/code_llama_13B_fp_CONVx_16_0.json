The statement is saying that if the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink. However, the statement is not saying that if the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was crampled.\n\nThe statement is using the word \"sproted\" to mean \"spurted\" or \"sputtered,\" which is a different meaning than the word \"sneg\" which is a made-up word. The statement is not making a logical inference, but rather using a play on words to create a pun.\n\nAnswer: No",
