            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given premises are:\n\n1. Jen watched basketball.\n2. If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n\nTo infer 'Tom watched football', we need to use the given premises to form a logical argument. One way to do this is to assume that Tom did not watch football, and then show that this assumption leads to a contradiction.\n\nAssumption: Tom did not watch football.\n\n1. Jen watched basketball. (Premise)\n2. If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. (Premise)\n3. Therefore, if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball. (Conclusion)\n\nThis argument is valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises. However, this argument leads to a contradiction because the first premise states that Jen watched basketball, which contradicts the conclusion that Jen did not watch basketball. Therefore, we can infer that Tom watched football.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
