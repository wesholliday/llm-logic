If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nTo infer that Alex finished the race, we need to use the given information in a logical way. The given information is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the 'then') is true. In this case, the antecedent is 'Alex finished the race', and the consequent is 'Chris finished the race'.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Alex finished the race from the given information. The only thing we can infer is that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This is because the given information is a conditional statement, and it only tells us what happens if the antecedent is true.\n\nAnswer: No",
