It states that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nThe third statement, 'The alien visited Mars,' is a fact.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship between the statements:\n\n1. The robot visited Jupiter. (Fact)\n2. If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. (Conditional statement)\n3. The alien visited Mars. (Fact)\n\nFrom the given information, we can infer that the robot visited Jupiter. This is because the second statement states that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. Since the third statement states that the alien visited Mars, we can conclude that the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
