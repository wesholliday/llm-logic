If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n\nTo infer that Sue chose pizza, we need to analyze the given information and determine whether it is logically consistent.\n\nFirst, let's consider the premise: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true. In this case, the antecedent is \"Sue chose pizza.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion: \"Sue chose pizza.\" This statement is the conclusion of the conditional statement.\n\nTo determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premise, we need to analyze the relationship between the antecedent and the conclusion. In this case, the antecedent is \"Sue chose pizza,\" and the conclusion is \"Sue chose pizza.\"\n\nThe conclusion follows logically from the premise if the antecedent is true, and the conclusion is also true. In this case, the antecedent is \"Sue chose pizza,\" and the conclusion is also \"Sue chose pizza.\" Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
