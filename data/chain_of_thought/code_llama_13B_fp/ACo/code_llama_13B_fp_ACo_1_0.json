If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n\nTo infer that Mary was at the wedding, we need to use the given information in a logical way.\n\nFirst, we can see that the second statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the condition (Mary was at the wedding) is true.\n\nSecond, we can see that the first statement is a simple statement, which means that it is always true.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the second statement is only true if the first statement is true. In other words, the second statement is only true if Mary was at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
