The second statement, 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake,' tells us that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not tell us anything about the vampire's state of awake-ness. It only tells us that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake. Therefore, we cannot infer that the vampire is awake from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
