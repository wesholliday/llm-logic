The first statement tells us that Lucy visited the zoo.\n2. The second statement tells us that if Joe visited the park, then Lucy also visited the zoo.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that if Joe visited the park, then Lucy also visited the zoo. However, this does not necessarily mean that Joe visited the park.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Joe went to the park' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
