If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nTo infer that the doll was plastic, we need to use the second premise to deduce the truth of the first premise. However, the second premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the doll was plastic) is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the doll was plastic from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
