If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n\nTo infer 'The shirt was cotton', we need to find a logical connection between the two statements.\n\n1. The first statement tells us that the pants were denim.\n2. The second statement tells us that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants would be denim.\n\nIf we assume that the shirt was cotton, then we can use the second statement to infer that the pants would be denim. However, this does not necessarily mean that the shirt was cotton.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The shirt was cotton' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
