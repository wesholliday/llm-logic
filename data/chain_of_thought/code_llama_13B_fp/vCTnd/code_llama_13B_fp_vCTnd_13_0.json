The premise states that if Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much, which means that if he did exercise, then he did not exercise a lot. However, the conclusion states that if Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise, which is a contradiction to the premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
