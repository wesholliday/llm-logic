The premise states that if the room was tidied, then it was not tidied thoroughly. However, this does not mean that if the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied.\n\nFor example, if the room was tidied thoroughly, it could still be tidied, but in a more thorough manner. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise, and the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
