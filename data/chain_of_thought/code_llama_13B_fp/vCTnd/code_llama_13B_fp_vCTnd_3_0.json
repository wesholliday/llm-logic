The statement \"If I ate a meal, then I did not eat a large meal\" is not logically equivalent to \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal.\"\n\nThe first statement implies that if someone ate a meal, they did not eat a large meal. However, this does not necessarily mean that if someone ate a large meal, they did not eat a meal. For example, someone could have eaten a large meal and still eaten a meal.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
