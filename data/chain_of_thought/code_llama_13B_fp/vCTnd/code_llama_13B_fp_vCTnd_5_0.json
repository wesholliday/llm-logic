The statement \"If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly\" is a contradiction, as it implies that if the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly. This is a logical fallacy, as it is impossible for a room to be cleaned and not cleaned thoroughly at the same time.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned\" is also a contradiction, as it is based on a false premise.\n\nAnswer: No",
