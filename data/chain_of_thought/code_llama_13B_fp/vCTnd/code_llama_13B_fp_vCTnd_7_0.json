The statement \"If the customer was served, then he was not served promptly\" is a contradiction, as it implies that the customer was served but not served promptly. This is a logical fallacy known as a \"vacuous truth.\"\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served\" is also a contradiction and is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
