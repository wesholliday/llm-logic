It is logically invalid because it assumes that the conclusion follows from the premise, but it does not provide any evidence to support this assumption.\n\nIn other words, the argument assumes that if directions were explained clearly, then they were not provided, but it does not provide any evidence to support this assumption. Therefore, the argument is logically invalid.\n\nAnswer: No",
