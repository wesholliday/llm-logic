The conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nThe premise states that if a recommendation was made, then it was not a strong recommendation. This means that if a recommendation was made, it was not a strong recommendation. However, the conclusion states that if a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made. This is not necessarily true, as a strong recommendation could still be made even if a weaker recommendation was made earlier.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
