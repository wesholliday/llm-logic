This is not necessarily true, as someone can exercise strenuously without necessarily exercising at all.\n\nFor example, someone could exercise by doing light stretching or yoga, which would not be considered strenuous exercise. In this case, the premise of the argument would be false, as the person did exercise, but not strenuously.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
