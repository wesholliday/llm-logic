This is not necessarily true, as there may be other factors that contributed to the issue being addressed, such as the implementation of a new policy or the implementation of a new technology.\n\nAdditionally, the conclusion of the argument is also false, as it assumes that if the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed. This is not necessarily true, as there may be other factors that contributed to the issue being addressed effectively, such as the implementation of a new policy or the implementation of a new technology.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically invalid.\n\nAnswer: No",
