This is not necessarily true, as instructions can be given without being explained clearly.\n\nFor example, a person may be given instructions to perform a task without being told how to do it, but they may still be able to figure it out on their own. In this case, the instructions were given, but they were not explained clearly.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that if instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
