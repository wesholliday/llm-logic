The original statement is 'The wibble must be quork by fizzle and gribble frazzle'. This statement implies that there are two entities responsible for the wibble being quork: fizzle and gribble. The use of 'and' suggests a conjunction, indicating that both fizzle and gribble are involved in the action of making the wibble quork. \n\nHowever, the statement does not provide any information that would suggest fizzle is solely responsible for the wibble being quork. The phrase 'and gribble frazzle' indicates that gribble is also involved, but it does not imply that fizzle is the only one responsible. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The wibble must be quork by fizzle' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
