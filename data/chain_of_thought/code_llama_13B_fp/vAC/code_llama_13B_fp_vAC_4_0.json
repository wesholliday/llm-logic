In this case, the conclusion is 'The alien visited Mars', and the premises are 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter' and 'The robot visited Jupiter'.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. In this case, the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. This means that if the alien visited Mars, then it is also the case that the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nThe second premise states that the robot visited Jupiter. This means that the robot did, in fact, visit Jupiter.\n\nBased on the first premise, we can conclude that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. Since the robot did visit Jupiter, we can also conclude that the alien visited Mars.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
