In this case, the conclusion 'Joe went to the park' logically follows from the premises 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' and 'Lucy went to the zoo'.\n\nTo see why this is the case, let's consider the logical form of the argument:\n\n1. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n2. Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nTherefore, by Modus Ponens, we can conclude that Joe went to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
