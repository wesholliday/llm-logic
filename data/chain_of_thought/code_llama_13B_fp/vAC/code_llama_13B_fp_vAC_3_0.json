In affirmative deduction, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. This premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the 'then') is true. In this case, the antecedent is 'the book was written by James', and the consequent is 'the book is a mystery novel'.\n\nThe second premise states that the book is a mystery novel. This premise is a simple statement that is assumed to be true.\n\nThe conclusion states that the book was written by James. This conclusion logically follows from the premises, because if the book is a mystery novel and the book was written by James, then it must be the case that the book was written by James.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
