In this case, the conclusion is 'Jeff played basketball', which is not necessarily true based on the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. This premise is not necessarily true, as there may be other factors that influence whether or not someone plays basketball or tennis.\n\nThe second premise states that Amy played tennis. This premise is true, but it does not necessarily imply that Jeff played basketball.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
