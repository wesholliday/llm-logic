In this case, the conclusion is 'Tom watched football', which is not necessarily true based on the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This premise is not necessarily true, as there is no evidence to suggest that Tom and Jen watched the same sport.\n\nThe second premise states that Jen watched basketball. This premise is true, as it is a known fact.\n\nThe conclusion states that Tom watched football. This conclusion is not necessarily true, as there is no evidence to suggest that Tom watched football.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
