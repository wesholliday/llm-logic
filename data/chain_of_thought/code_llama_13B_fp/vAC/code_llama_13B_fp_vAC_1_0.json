The first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. The second premise states that Sue was at the wedding. The conclusion states that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it is a form of affirmative dilemma, which is a type of argument that is logically valid. In an affirmative dilemma, the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion logically follows from the premises because the first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. Since the second premise states that Sue was at the wedding, it follows that Mary was also at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
