            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion 'Alex finished the race' logically follows from the premises 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' and 'Chris finished the race is true'.\n\nTo see why this is the case, let's consider the possible truth values of the premises and the conclusion. If the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nPremise 1: If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\n\n* If the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n* If the premise is false, then the conclusion may or may not be true.\n\nPremise 2: Chris finished the race is true\n\n* If the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n* If the premise is false, then the conclusion may or may not be true.\n\nConclusion: Alex finished the race\n\n* If the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n* If the premises are false, then the conclusion may or may not be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid if the premises are true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
