            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is \"The car was red\" and the premises are \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" and \"The truck was blue\".\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. In this case, the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. This means that if the car was red, we can infer that the truck was blue.\n\nThe second premise states that the truck was blue. This means that we know for certain that the truck was blue.\n\nUsing the first premise, we can infer that if the truck was blue, then the car was red. This is a logical consequence of the first premise.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The car was red\" logically follows from the premises \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" and \"The truck was blue\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
