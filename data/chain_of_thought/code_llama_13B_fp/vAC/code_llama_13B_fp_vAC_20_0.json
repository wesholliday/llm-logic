In this case, the conclusion is 'The apple was red' and the premises are 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' and 'The banana was yellow'.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. In this case, the conclusion logically follows from the premises if the implication in the first premise is true.\n\nThe implication in the first premise is 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'. This means that if the apple was red, then it is also the case that the banana was yellow.\n\nThe second premise states that the banana was yellow. Therefore, we can conclude that the apple was red. This conclusion logically follows from the premises, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
