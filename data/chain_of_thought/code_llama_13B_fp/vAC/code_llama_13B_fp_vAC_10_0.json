In this case, the conclusion is \"The dog was inside\" and the premises are \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" and \"The cat was outside.\"\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. In this case, the conclusion logically follows from the premises if we assume that the dog and the cat are both inside or both outside.\n\nIf we assume that the dog and the cat are both inside, then the first premise is true, and the second premise is also true. Therefore, the conclusion \"The dog was inside\" is logically valid.\n\nIf we assume that the dog and the cat are both outside, then the first premise is false, and the second premise is also true. Therefore, the conclusion \"The dog was inside\" is also logically valid.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
