In this case, the conclusion is 'Lisa bought the red shirt', and the premises are 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' and 'Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. In this case, the conclusion logically follows from the premises if the conclusion is true, and the premises are true.\n\nHowever, there is a problem with the argument. The conclusion 'Lisa bought the red shirt' is not necessarily true, even if the premises are true. For example, if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, but Mark did buy the blue shirt, then the argument would still be logically valid.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
