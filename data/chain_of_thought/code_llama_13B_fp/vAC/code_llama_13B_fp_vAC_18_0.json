            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is \"The doll was plastic\" and the premises are \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" and \"The truck was metal\".\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. In this case, the conclusion is a logical implication of the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. This means that if the doll was plastic, then it is also the case that the truck was metal.\n\nThe second premise states that the truck was metal. This means that the truck was indeed metal.\n\nBased on the first premise, we can conclude that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. Since the second premise states that the truck was metal, we can also conclude that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The doll was plastic\" logically follows from the premises \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" and \"The truck was metal\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
