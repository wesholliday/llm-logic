            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is \"The cake was chocolate\" and the premises are \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" and \"The muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. In this case, the conclusion logically follows from the premises if the first premise is true.\n\nThe first premise states that \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This means that if the cake was chocolate, then it is also the case that the muffins were blueberry.\n\nThe second premise states that \"The muffins were blueberry.\" This means that the muffins were indeed blueberry.\n\nTherefore, if the first premise is true, then the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry, and the muffins were indeed blueberry. Therefore, the conclusion \"The cake was chocolate\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
