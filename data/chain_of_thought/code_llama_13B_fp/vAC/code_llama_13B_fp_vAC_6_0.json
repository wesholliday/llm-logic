In this case, the conclusion is 'Sue chose pizza', and the premises are 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta' and 'Bob chose pasta'.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. In this case, the conclusion logically follows from the premises if and only if the implication 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta' is true.\n\nHowever, the implication 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta' is not necessarily true. For example, if Sue chose pizza and Bob chose pasta, then the implication would be true. But if Sue chose pasta and Bob chose pizza, then the implication would be false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid, because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
