This means that it is possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, but it is not necessarily true that she did not buy it.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Lisa might not have bought the red shirt. The statement only tells us that it is not true that Lisa must have bought the red shirt, but it does not provide any information about whether or not she bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
