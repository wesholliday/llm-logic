However, it does not necessarily follow that the griffin might not have been in the forest.\n\nFor example, if the griffin was in the forest but was not necessarily present in the forest at a particular time, then it would be possible to infer that the griffin might not have been in the forest. However, if the griffin was not in the forest at all, then it would not be possible to infer that the griffin might not have been in the forest.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is \"no\". We cannot infer that the griffin might not have been in the forest based solely on the statement \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\".",
