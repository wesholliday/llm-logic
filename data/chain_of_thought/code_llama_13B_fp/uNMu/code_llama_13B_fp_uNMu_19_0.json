However, it does not necessarily mean that the watch might not be charging on the dresser.\n\nFor example, if the watch is not charging on the dresser because it is not plugged in, then it is not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser. However, it is still possible that the watch might not be charging on the dresser because it is not plugged in.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"no\". We cannot infer that the watch might not be charging on the dresser based solely on the statement \"It's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser\".",
