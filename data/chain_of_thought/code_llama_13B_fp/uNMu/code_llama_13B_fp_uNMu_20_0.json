This uncertainty could be due to a variety of factors, such as the sunglasses being lost or misplaced, or the bag being misplaced or lost.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the sunglasses must be in her bag, as there is some uncertainty about their location. However, we can infer that the sunglasses might not be in her bag, as there is some evidence to suggest that they are not in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
