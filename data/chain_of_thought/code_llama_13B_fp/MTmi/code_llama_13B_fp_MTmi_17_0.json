Kate might not have eaten salad.\n\nTo infer that Ben did not eat pasta, we need to use the first premise to deduce that Kate must have eaten salad, and then use the second premise to rule out the possibility that Kate did not eat salad.\n\nHowever, the second premise only states that Kate might not have eaten salad, and does not provide any information about whether she actually did or did not eat salad. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Ben did not eat pasta based solely on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
