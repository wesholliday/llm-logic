In this case, the condition is that the car was red. If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. However, the statement also says that the truck might not have been blue. This means that the condition of the truck being blue is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the car was not red based on the given information. The car could have been red, and the truck could have been blue, or the car could have been red and the truck could have been something else. We need more information to make a conclusion about the car's color.\n\nAnswer: No",
