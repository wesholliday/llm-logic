            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that Tom did not watch football from the given information, we need to carefully consider the logical relationships between the statements.\n\nThe first statement, \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball,\" suggests that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. This statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the condition (Tom watched football) is met.\n\nThe second statement, \"Jen might not have watched basketball,\" suggests that Jen did not necessarily watch basketball. This statement is a possibility, but it does not necessarily mean that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of these two statements. If we assume that Tom watched football, then we can infer that Jen must have watched basketball. However, if we also assume that Jen might not have watched basketball, then we cannot infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nIn other words, the fact that Jen might not have watched basketball does not provide any information about Tom's behavior. Therefore, we cannot infer that Tom did not watch football based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
