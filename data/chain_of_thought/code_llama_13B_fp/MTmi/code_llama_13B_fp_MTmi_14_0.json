The wolf might not have been in the den.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the bear was not in the cave, we need to analyze the relationship between the premises.\n\nPremise 1 states that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den. This means that if the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf might not have been in the den.\n\nPremise 2 states that the wolf might not have been in the den. This means that the wolf might have been in the den or might not have been in the den.\n\nSince we are given that the wolf might not have been in the den, we cannot infer that the bear was not in the cave. The relationship between the premises is not strong enough to allow us to make this inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
