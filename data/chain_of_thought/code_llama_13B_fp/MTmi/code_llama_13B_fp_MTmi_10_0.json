The cat might not have been outside.\n\nTo infer that the dog was not inside, we need to analyze the relationship between the two premises.\n\nPremise 1 states that if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside. This means that if the dog was not inside, then the cat might have been outside.\n\nPremise 2 states that the cat might not have been outside. This means that the cat might have been inside or outside.\n\nSince we are given that the cat might not have been outside, we cannot conclude that the dog was not inside. The dog might have been inside, and the cat might have been outside.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the dog was not inside from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
