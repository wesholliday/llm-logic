In this case, the condition is that the apple is red. If the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow. However, the statement also says that the banana might not have been yellow. This means that the condition of the banana being yellow is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the apple was not red based on the given information. The apple could have been red, and the banana could have been yellow, or the apple could have been red, and the banana could have been something else. We need more information to make a conclusion about the color of the apple.\n\nAnswer: No",
