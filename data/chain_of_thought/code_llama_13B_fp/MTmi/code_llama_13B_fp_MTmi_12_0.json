Lucy might not have gone to the zoo.\n\nTo infer that Joe did not go to the park, we need to analyze the logical relationships between the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This means that if Joe did not go to the park, then it is not necessary that Lucy went to the zoo. In other words, the first premise does not provide any information about whether or not Joe went to the park.\n\nThe second premise states that Lucy might not have gone to the zoo. This means that it is possible that Lucy did not go to the zoo, but it does not necessarily follow that she did not go to the zoo.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Joe did not go to the park based on the given premises. The first premise does not provide any information about Joe's actions, and the second premise only states that Lucy might not have gone to the zoo, but it does not rule out the possibility that she did go to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: No",
