            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given premises are:\n\n1. If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\n2. The truck might not have been metal.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the doll was not plastic, we need to analyze the relationship between the premises.\n\nPremise 1 states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. This means that if the doll was plastic, we can conclude that the truck was metal.\n\nPremise 2 states that the truck might not have been metal. This means that the truck could have been something other than metal, such as plastic or wood.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of these premises. If the truck was not metal, then it could have been plastic or wood, which would mean that the doll was not plastic. However, if the truck was metal, then the doll must have been plastic, which would mean that the doll was plastic.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic from the given premises. The only thing we can say is that the doll could have been plastic or not plastic, depending on the material of the truck.\n\nAnswer: No",
