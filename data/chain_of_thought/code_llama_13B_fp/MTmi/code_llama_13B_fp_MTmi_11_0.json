In this case, the condition is that the cake is chocolate.\n\nThe first statement, \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry,\" is a conditional statement that is only true if the cake is chocolate. If the cake is not chocolate, then the statement is not true.\n\nThe second statement, \"The muffins might not have been blueberry,\" is a statement that is true regardless of whether the cake is chocolate or not. This statement does not provide any information about the color of the muffins, and it does not contradict the first statement.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot infer that the cake was not chocolate. The first statement only provides information about the color of the muffins if the cake is chocolate, and the second statement does not provide any information about the color of the muffins. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the cake was not chocolate based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
