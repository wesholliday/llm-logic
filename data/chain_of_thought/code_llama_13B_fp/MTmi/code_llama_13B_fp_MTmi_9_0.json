            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, we need to consider the information provided in the question. The first statement is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt'. This statement implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nThe second statement is 'Mark might not have bought the blue shirt'. This statement suggests that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, but it does not necessarily mean that he did not buy it.\n\nTo infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, we need to consider the information provided in the first statement and the possibility that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. If we assume that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nHowever, if we assume that Mark did buy the blue shirt, then we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This is because the first statement only implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt, but it does not necessarily mean that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt based on the information provided in the question.\n\nAnswer: No",
