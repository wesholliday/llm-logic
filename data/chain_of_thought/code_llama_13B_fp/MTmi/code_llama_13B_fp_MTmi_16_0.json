The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\" is a logical fallacy known as the \"affirming the consequent\" fallacy. This fallacy occurs when a conclusion is drawn based on a false premise. In this case, the premise \"The shirt was cotton\" is false, and therefore the conclusion \"The pants must have been denim\" is also false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The shirt was not cotton\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
