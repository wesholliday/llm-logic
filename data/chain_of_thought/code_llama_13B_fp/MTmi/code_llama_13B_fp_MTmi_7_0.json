Chris might not have finished the race.\n\nTo infer that Alex did not finish the race, we need to analyze the logical relationships between the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race. This means that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris might not have finished the race either.\n\nThe second premise states that Chris might not have finished the race. This means that we cannot conclude that Chris did not finish the race based solely on this premise.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Alex did not finish the race based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
