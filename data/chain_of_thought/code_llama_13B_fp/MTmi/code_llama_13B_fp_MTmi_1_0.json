            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding, we need to consider the information provided in the premises. The first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. The second premise states that Sue might not have been at the wedding.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the first premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the condition (Mary was at the wedding) is met. However, the second premise is a statement that Sue might not have been at the wedding, which means that it is possible that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding based solely on the information provided. The conclusion that Mary was not at the wedding is not necessarily true, as we do not have enough information to make that determination.\n\nAnswer: No",
