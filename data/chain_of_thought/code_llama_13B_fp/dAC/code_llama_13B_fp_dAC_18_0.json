            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo deduce whether the doll was plastic or not, we need to analyze the given information and the logical relationships between them.\n\nThe first statement, \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal,\" suggests that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must be metal. This statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the doll was plastic) is true.\n\nThe second statement, \"The truck was metal,\" is a simple statement that states the fact that the truck was metal.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationships between these two statements:\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the doll was plastic) is true.\n2. The second statement is a simple statement that states the fact that the truck was metal.\n\nSince the first statement is a conditional statement, it is not enough to deduce whether the doll was plastic or not. We need to consider the second statement, which states that the truck was metal.\n\nIf we assume that the doll was plastic, then the truck must be metal, as stated in the first statement. However, the second statement states that the truck was metal, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, we cannot deduce that the doll was plastic based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
