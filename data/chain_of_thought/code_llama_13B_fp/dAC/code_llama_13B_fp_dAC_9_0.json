            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo deduce 'Lisa bought the red shirt' from the given information, we need to use the principle of deduction. This means that we need to use the information provided to make a logical conclusion.\n\nIn this case, we are given two statements:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n2. Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nWe can see that the first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the condition (Lisa bought the red shirt) is met. However, we are also given the second statement, which states that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nIf we assume that the first statement is true, then we can deduce that Lisa bought the red shirt. This is because the first statement states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. Since Mark bought the blue shirt, we can conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nHowever, we are not given any information about Lisa's purchase of the red shirt. Therefore, we cannot deduce that Lisa bought the red shirt from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
