The first statement, \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake,\" suggests that if the vampire is awake, the mummy will also be awake. However, the second statement, \"The mummy was awake,\" does not necessarily imply that the vampire is also awake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot deduce that the vampire was awake based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
