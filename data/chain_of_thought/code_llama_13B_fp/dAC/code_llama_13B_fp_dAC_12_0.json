This means that we need to use the information provided to make a logical conclusion.\n\nIn this case, we are given two statements:\n\n1. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n2. Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can deduce that Joe went to the park. This is because the first statement implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy would also go to the zoo. Since Lucy did go to the zoo, we can conclude that Joe must have gone to the park.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes, we can deduce 'Joe went to the park' from the given information.",
