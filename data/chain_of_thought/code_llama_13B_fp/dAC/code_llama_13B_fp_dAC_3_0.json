It means that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. This premise does not provide any information about whether the book was actually written by James or not.\n\nThe second premise, \"The book is a mystery novel,\" is a statement of fact. It does not provide any information about who wrote the book.\n\nBased on the given premises, we cannot deduce that the book was written by James. The first premise does not provide any information about the authorship of the book, and the second premise only states that the book is a mystery novel. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nAnswer: no",
