Modus ponens states that if we have a statement of the form 'if P, then Q' and we know that P is true, then we can deduce that Q is also true.\n\nIn this case, we have the statement 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' and we know that Chris finished the race. Therefore, we can use modus ponens to deduce that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
