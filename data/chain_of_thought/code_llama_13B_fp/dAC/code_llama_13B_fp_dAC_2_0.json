            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo deduce whether the griffin was in the forest, we need to analyze the given information and determine whether it is sufficient to conclude that the griffin was also in the forest.\n\nThe first premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was also in the forest. This means that if the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn could not be in the forest. However, the second premise states that the unicorn was indeed in the forest, which means that the griffin must also be in the forest.\n\nTherefore, we can deduce that the griffin was also in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
