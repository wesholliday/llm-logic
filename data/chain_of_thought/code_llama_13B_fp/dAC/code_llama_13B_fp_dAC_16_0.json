The first statement states that \"if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This means that if the shirt was cotton, then it is certain that the pants were denim.\n\nThe second statement states that \"the pants were denim.\" This means that the pants were indeed denim, regardless of whether the shirt was cotton or not.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of these two statements. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. However, we also know that the pants were denim. This means that the shirt was not cotton, because if it were, then the pants would not have been denim.\n\nTherefore, we cannot deduce that the shirt was cotton based on the information provided. The answer is no.",
