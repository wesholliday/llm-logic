            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo deduce 'The cake was chocolate' from 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' together with 'The muffins were blueberry', we need to use the principle of conditional proof. This means that we need to show that the conclusion of the conditional statement is true, given the premise.\n\nIn this case, the premise is 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry'. The conclusion is 'The muffins were blueberry'. We also have the additional premise 'The muffins were blueberry'.\n\nTo deduce 'The cake was chocolate', we need to show that the conclusion of the conditional statement is true, given the premise. In other words, we need to show that 'The muffins were blueberry' is true, given 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry'.\n\nHowever, we are not given any information about the cake being chocolate or not. Therefore, we cannot deduce 'The cake was chocolate' from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
