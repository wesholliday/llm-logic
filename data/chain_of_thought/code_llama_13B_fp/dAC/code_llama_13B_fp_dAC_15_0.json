            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo deduce 'Sam took a plane' from 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' together with 'Erin took a train', we need to use the principle of conditional proof. This means that we need to show that the conclusion of the conditional statement ('Sam took a plane') is true, given the premises ('If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' and 'Erin took a train').\n\nIn this case, we can see that the premises are not contradictory, so we can use the principle of conditional proof to deduce the conclusion. Specifically, we can use the law of excluded middle to deduce that either 'Sam took a plane' or 'Sam did not take a plane'. Since we know that 'Erin took a train', we can conclude that 'Sam took a plane'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'yes'.",
