However, the conclusion \"The floob must be on the quibble\" is an attempt to infer that the floob is specifically on the quibble, without considering the possibility that it might be in the bimboozle instead. This is a logical fallacy because it ignores the other option in the disjunction.\n\nAnswer: no"
