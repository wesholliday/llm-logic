The statement 'The wozzle must be on the blimp or in the plimp' is a disjunction, which means it presents two possibilities: the wozzle is either on the blimp or in the plimp. This statement does not provide any information that would allow us to eliminate one of the possibilities, so we cannot conclude that the wozzle must be in the plimp. The statement only tells us that the wozzle is in one of the two locations, but it does not specify which one.\n\nAnswer: no"
