The first premise is 'The snizzle must be quank or quazzle', which is a disjunction (a statement that includes two or more possibilities). The second premise is not explicitly stated, but we can infer that it is 'The snizzle is not quank'. If the snizzle is not quank, then it must be quazzle, according to the first premise. \n\nAnswer: yes"
