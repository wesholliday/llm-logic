This statement presents two options for what the blurble must be: 'plonk' or 'on blimple'. The use of 'or' indicates that these are mutually exclusive possibilities, meaning the blurble can either be 'plonk' or 'on blimple', but not both. Therefore, we cannot infer that the blurble must be 'on blimple' because the statement does not rule out the possibility that the blurble is 'plonk'. \n\nAnswer: no"
