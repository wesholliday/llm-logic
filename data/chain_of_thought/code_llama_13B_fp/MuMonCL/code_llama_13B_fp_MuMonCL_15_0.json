The original statement says that the password must have been eight characters long and included a number. The word \"and\" is a conjunction that indicates that both conditions must be met. Therefore, we can infer that the password must have been eight characters long, because it is one of the two conditions stated in the original sentence.\n\nAnswer: yes"
