The statement \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for\" implies that the delivery of the package and the act of signing for it are two parts of the same event. Therefore, if the package was signed for, it is reasonable to infer that it was delivered on the same day, as the act of signing for it would not have occurred if it had not been delivered. This is a logical conclusion based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: yes"
