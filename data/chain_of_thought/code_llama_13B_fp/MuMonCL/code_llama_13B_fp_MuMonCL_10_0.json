            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical inference, where we can deduce a specific statement from a more general one. The original statement \"The document must have been signed and notarized\" implies that the document has two conditions that must be met: it must be signed and it must be notarized. The word \"and\" is a conjunction that indicates both conditions are required. Therefore, if the document must have been signed and notarized, it logically follows that it must have been signed. This is because the condition of being signed is a necessary condition for the document to be valid, regardless of whether it was notarized or not.\n\nAnswer: yes"
