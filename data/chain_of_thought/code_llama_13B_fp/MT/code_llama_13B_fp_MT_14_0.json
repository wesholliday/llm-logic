            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the bear was not in the cave, we need to analyze the given information and the logical relationships between them.\n\nThe first premise, \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den,\" suggests that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf must be in the den. This implies that the wolf is dependent on the bear's presence in the cave.\n\nThe second premise, \"The wolf was not in the den,\" states that the wolf is not in the den. This means that the wolf is not dependent on the bear's presence in the cave.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can infer that the bear was not in the cave. This is because the wolf is not in the den, which means that the wolf is not dependent on the bear's presence in the cave. Therefore, the bear is not in the cave either, since the wolf is not there to support the bear's presence.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
