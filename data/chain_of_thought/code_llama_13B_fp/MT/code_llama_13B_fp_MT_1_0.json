            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'Mary was not at the wedding' from the given information, we need to analyze the logical relationships between the statements.\n\nThe first statement, 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,' is a conditional statement. It means that if Mary was at the wedding, then it is also true that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nThe second statement, 'Sue was not at the wedding,' is a direct statement. It simply states that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical relationships between these two statements. If we assume that Mary was at the wedding, then we can conclude that Sue was also at the wedding, based on the first statement. However, we know that Sue was not at the wedding, based on the second statement. This creates a contradiction, as we have two statements that are mutually exclusive.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Mary was not at the wedding' from the given information. The only conclusion we can draw is that the first statement is false, as it implies that Mary was at the wedding, which is not the case.\n\nAnswer: No",
