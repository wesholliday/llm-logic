            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest, we need to analyze the given information and the logical relationships between them.\n\nThe first premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. This means that if the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nThe second premise states that the unicorn was not in the forest. This means that the unicorn was not in the forest, regardless of whether the griffin was in the forest or not.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest, because the second premise states that the unicorn was not in the forest, and the first premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. Since the unicorn was not in the forest, and the griffin was not in the forest, we can conclude that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
