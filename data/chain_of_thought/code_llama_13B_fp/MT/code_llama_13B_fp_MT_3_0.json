This means that if the book is not a mystery novel, then it cannot be written by James.\n\nThe second premise states that the book is not a mystery novel. This means that the book is not a mystery novel, regardless of who wrote it.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the book was not written by James based on the given information. The book could have been written by someone else who is not James, or it could have been written by James but not be a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: No",
