            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'The apple was not red' from the given information, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement, 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow,' is a conditional statement. It states that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow. This statement is a logical consequence of the second statement, 'The banana was not yellow.'\n\nThe second statement, 'The banana was not yellow,' is a simple statement that states that the banana is not yellow. This statement is independent of the first statement and does not provide any information about the color of the apple.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure of the statements:\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that is true only if a certain condition is met. In this case, the condition is that the apple is red.\n2. The second statement is a simple statement that states that the banana is not yellow. This statement is independent of the first statement and does not provide any information about the color of the apple.\n\nBased on the logical structure of the statements, we can conclude that we cannot infer 'The apple was not red' from the given information. The reason is that the second statement, 'The banana was not yellow,' does not provide any information about the color of the apple. The first statement, 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow,' is a logical consequence of the second statement, but it does not provide any information about the color of the apple. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The apple was not red' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
