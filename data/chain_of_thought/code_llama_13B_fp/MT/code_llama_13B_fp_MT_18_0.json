            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the doll was not plastic from the given information, we need to carefully consider the relationships between the objects and the properties they possess.\n\nThe first statement, \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal,\" suggests that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. This implies that the doll and the truck are related in some way, and that the property of being plastic is related to the property of being metal.\n\nThe second statement, \"The truck was not metal,\" tells us that the truck is not metal. This information is consistent with the first statement, as it suggests that the truck is not related to the property of being metal.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not tell us anything about the doll. We do not know whether the doll is plastic or not, as this information is not provided. Therefore, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
