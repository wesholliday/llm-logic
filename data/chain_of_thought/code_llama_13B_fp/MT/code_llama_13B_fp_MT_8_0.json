            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the vampire was not awake from the given information, we need to carefully consider the relationships between the entities.\n\nThe first statement, \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake,\" suggests that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake. This implies that the vampire and the mummy are in some way related, and that their states of being awake or asleep are interdependent.\n\nThe second statement, \"The mummy was not awake,\" tells us that the mummy is not currently awake. This information does not directly contradict the first statement, as it only tells us that the mummy is not currently awake, rather than saying that the mummy is never awake.\n\nHowever, when we consider the relationships between the vampire and the mummy, we can see that the first statement implies that the vampire and the mummy are in a state of mutual awakening. If the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake, and vice versa. Therefore, if the mummy is not awake, then the vampire must also be asleep.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the vampire was not awake from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
