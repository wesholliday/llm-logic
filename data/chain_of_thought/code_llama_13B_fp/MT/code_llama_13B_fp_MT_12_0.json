            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that Joe did not go to the park from the given information, we need to analyze the logical relationships between the statements.\n\nThe first statement, \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo,\" is a conditional statement. It means that if Joe went to the park, then it is also true that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nThe second statement, \"Lucy did not go to the zoo,\" is a direct statement. It means that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationships between these two statements:\n\n1. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n2. Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that Joe did not go to the park. This is because if Joe went to the park, then it would also be true that Lucy went to the zoo, which is not the case. Therefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
