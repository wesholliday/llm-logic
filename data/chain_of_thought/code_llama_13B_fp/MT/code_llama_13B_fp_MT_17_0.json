It means that if Ben ate pasta, then it is also true that Kate ate the salad.\n\nThe second statement, 'Kate did not eat the salad,' is a direct statement. It means that Kate did not eat the salad.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of these two statements. If Ben ate pasta, then it is also true that Kate ate the salad. However, we know that Kate did not eat the salad. This means that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'Ben did not eat pasta' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
