The first statement says that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. The second statement says that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt. However, this does not necessarily mean that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. It is possible that Lisa bought the red shirt and Mark bought the blue shirt, but Mark did not buy the blue shirt for some other reason.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt based solely on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No",
