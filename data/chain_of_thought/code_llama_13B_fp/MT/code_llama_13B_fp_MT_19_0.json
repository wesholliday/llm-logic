It means that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nThe second premise, 'Jen did not watch basketball,' is a statement of fact. It means that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion, 'Tom did not watch football.' This is the statement we want to infer from the given premises.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'Tom did not watch football' from the premises, we need to analyze the logical relationships between the statements.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is not a necessary condition for the conclusion to be true. In other words, if the first premise is true, it does not necessarily mean that the conclusion is also true.\n\nThe second premise is a statement of fact, which means that it is a necessary condition for the conclusion to be true. In other words, if the second premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Tom did not watch football' from the given premises. The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
