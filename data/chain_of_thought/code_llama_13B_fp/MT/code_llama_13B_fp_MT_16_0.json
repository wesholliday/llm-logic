This statement implies that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must be denim. However, this statement does not necessarily mean that if the pants are not denim, then the shirt is not cotton.\n\nThe second piece of information is 'The pants were not denim.' This statement tells us that the pants are not denim. However, this information does not necessarily tell us anything about the shirt.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot infer that the shirt was not cotton. The shirt could still be cotton, even if the pants are not denim. Therefore, the answer is 'no'.",
