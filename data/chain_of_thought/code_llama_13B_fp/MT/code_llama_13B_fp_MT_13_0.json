            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'The car was not red' from 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' together with 'The truck was not blue', we need to consider the logical relationships between the statements.\n\n'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' is a conditional statement, which means that if the premise (the car was red) is true, then the conclusion (the truck was blue) must also be true. However, if the premise is false, then the conclusion may or may not be true.\n\n'The truck was not blue' is a statement that the truck was not blue, which is a fact.\n\nNow, we need to consider whether the conclusion of the conditional statement ('The truck was blue') is true or false given the premise ('The car was red'). If the premise is false, then the conclusion is also false, which means that 'The car was not red' is a logical consequence of the statements.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The car was not red' from 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' together with 'The truck was not blue'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
