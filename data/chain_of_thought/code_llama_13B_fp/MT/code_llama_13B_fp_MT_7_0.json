            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that Alex did not finish the race from the given information, we need to analyze the logical relationships between the statements.\n\nThe first statement, \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race,\" is a conditional statement. It means that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must also have finished the race.\n\nThe second statement, \"Chris did not finish the race,\" is a direct statement that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationships between these two statements:\n\n1. If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n2. Chris did not finish the race.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that Alex did not finish the race. This is because if Alex finished the race, then Chris must also have finished the race, but we know that Chris did not finish the race. Therefore, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
