It means that if the bear was in the cave, then it is certain that the wolf was in the den. However, the statement \"the wolf might not have been in the den\" is a separate statement that does not necessarily contradict the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the bear was not in the cave based solely on the information provided. The bear could have been in the cave and the wolf could have been in the den, or the bear could have been in the cave and the wolf could have been elsewhere.\n\nAnswer: No",
