The answer to this question is yes.\n\nHere's why:\n\nIf the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. This is because the question states that the book was written by James, and the only other option is that the book is not a mystery novel. Therefore, if the book is not a mystery novel, it must have been written by someone else.\n\nHowever, the question also states that the book might not be a mystery novel. This means that there is a possibility that the book was not written by James, even if it is not a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the book was not written by James based on the information that the book might not be a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: yes",
