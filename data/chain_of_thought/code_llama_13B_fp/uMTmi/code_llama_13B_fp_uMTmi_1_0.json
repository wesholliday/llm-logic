The statement states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. However, the statement also states that Sue might not have been at the wedding. This creates a contradiction, as the statement implies that both Mary and Sue were at the wedding, but also implies that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding based on the given information. The statement is ambiguous and does not provide enough information to make a conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
