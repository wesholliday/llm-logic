It means that if Ben ate pasta, then it is certain that Kate must have eaten salad. However, the statement \"Kate might not have eaten salad\" is a separate statement that does not necessarily contradict the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Ben did not eat pasta based solely on the information provided. We need more information to make a conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No",
