It means that if the doll was plastic, then it is certain that the truck must have been metal. However, the statement \"The truck might not have been metal\" is a separate statement that does not necessarily contradict the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic based on the information provided. The doll could have been plastic and the truck could have been metal, or the doll could have been plastic and the truck could have been something else.\n\nAnswer: No",
