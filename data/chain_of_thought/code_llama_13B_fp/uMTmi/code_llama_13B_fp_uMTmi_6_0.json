The statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\" can be written as \"If pizza is chosen by Sue, then pasta is chosen by Bob.\"\n\nThe statement \"Bob might not have chosen pasta\" is a separate statement that is not related to the first statement. It is a statement that expresses a possibility, but it does not affect the relationship between the two events.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Sue did not choose pizza based on the given information. The only thing we can say is that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob might have chosen pasta, but we cannot say for sure that he did.\n\nAnswer: No",
