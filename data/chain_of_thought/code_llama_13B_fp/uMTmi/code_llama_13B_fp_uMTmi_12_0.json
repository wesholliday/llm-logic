            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that is true if a certain condition is met. In this case, the condition is that Joe went to the park. The conclusion of the statement is that Lucy must have gone to the zoo. However, the statement also mentions that Lucy might not have gone to the zoo.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that Joe did not go to the park, we need to consider the information provided in the statement. If we assume that Lucy did not go to the zoo, then we can infer that Joe did not go to the park. This is because the statement states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then it is not possible for Joe to have gone to the park.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park if we assume that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: yes",
