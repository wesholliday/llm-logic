The statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis\" is a conditional statement that expresses a relationship between the events \"Jeff played basketball\" and \"Amy played tennis\".\n\nThe statement \"Amy might not have played tennis\" is a statement that expresses a possibility, but it does not express a relationship between the events \"Amy played tennis\" and \"Jeff played basketball\".
