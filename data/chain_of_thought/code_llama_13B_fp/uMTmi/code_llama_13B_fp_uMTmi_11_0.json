It suggests that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. However, the statement \"The muffins might not have been blueberry\" suggests that there is no causal relationship between the muffins and the cake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the cake was not chocolate based solely on the information provided. The cake could have been chocolate and the muffins could have been blueberry, or the cake could have been chocolate and the muffins could have been something else entirely.\n\nAnswer: No",
