The statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train\" implies that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. However, the statement \"Erin might not have taken a train\" suggests that Erin might not have taken a train, which does not necessarily mean that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Sam did not take a plane based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
