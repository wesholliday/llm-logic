In this case, the condition is that Tom watched football. However, the statement also mentions that Jen might not have watched basketball, which means that the condition is not always met.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Tom did not watch football based on the given information. The statement only tells us that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball, but it does not tell us anything about what happened if Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nAnswer: No",
