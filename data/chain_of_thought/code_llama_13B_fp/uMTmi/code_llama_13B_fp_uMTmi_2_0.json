It means that if the griffin was in the forest, then it is certain that the unicorn was also in the forest.\n\nHowever, the statement \"the unicorn might not have been in the forest\" is a logical possibility. It means that even if the griffin was in the forest, it is not necessarily true that the unicorn was also in the forest.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the griffin was not in the forest based solely on the information provided. The griffin could have been in the forest, and the unicorn could have been in the forest, or the unicorn could have been elsewhere.\n\nAnswer: no",
