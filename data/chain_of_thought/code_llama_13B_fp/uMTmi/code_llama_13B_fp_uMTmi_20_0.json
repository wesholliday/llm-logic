It means that if the apple was red, then it is necessarily true that the banana was yellow. However, the statement \"the banana might not have been yellow\" is a separate statement that does not necessarily follow from the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the apple was not red based solely on the information provided. The apple could have been red and the banana could have been yellow, or the apple could have been red and the banana could have been some other color.\n\nAnswer: No",
