In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premises and the conclusion. The first premise states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race. This means that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that Chris must have finished the race. This means that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nThe conclusion states that Alex did not finish the race. This is true because Alex did not finish the race, and Chris did not finish the race.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
