The first premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. The second premise states that it is not the case that the banana must have been yellow. The conclusion states that the apple was not red.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it is a valid argument from a contradiction because the first premise and the second premise are contradictory. If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow, but the second premise states that it is not the case that the banana must have been yellow. Therefore, the conclusion that the apple was not red follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
