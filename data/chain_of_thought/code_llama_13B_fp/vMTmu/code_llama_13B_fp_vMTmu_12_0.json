            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it is a valid argument form known as a syllogism. The first premise states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. The second premise states that it is not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo. The conclusion states that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nThe argument form is valid because it follows the correct structure of a syllogism, which consists of a major premise, a minor premise, and a conclusion. The major premise is the first premise, which states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. The minor premise is the second premise, which states that it is not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo. The conclusion is the third premise, which states that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it follows the correct structure of a syllogism and because the premises are logically consistent. The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the 'then') is true. In this case, the antecedent is 'Joe went to the park', and the consequent is 'Lucy must have gone to the zoo'. If the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n\nThe second premise is a negation, which means that it is only true if the statement is false. In this case, the statement is 'Lucy must have gone to the zoo', and the negation is 'it is not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo'. If the statement is false, then the negation is true.\n\nThe conclusion is a negation, which means that it is only true if the statement is false. In this case, the statement is 'Joe did not go to the park', and the negation is 'Joe did not go to the park'. If the statement is false, then the negation is true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it follows the correct structure of a syllogism and because the premises are logically consistent.\n\nAnswer: yes",
