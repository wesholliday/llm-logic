            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premises and the conclusion. The first premise states that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. This premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the 'then') is true. In this case, the antecedent is 'Tom watched football', and the consequent is 'Jen must have watched basketball'.\n\nThe second premise states that it is not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. This premise is a negation of the first premise, which means that it is only true if the first premise is false.\n\nThe conclusion states that Tom did not watch football. This conclusion is a negation of the first premise, which means that it is only true if the first premise is false.\n\nNow, let's examine the argument in more detail. If the first premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true. However, if the second premise is true, then the first premise is false, and the conclusion must also be false. Therefore, the argument is logically valid if the first premise is true and the second premise is false.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
