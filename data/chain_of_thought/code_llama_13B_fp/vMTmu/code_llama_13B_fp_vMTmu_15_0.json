The first premise states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. The second premise states that it is not the case that Erin must have taken a train. The conclusion states that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it is a valid argument from a contradiction. The first premise and the second premise are contradictory, which means that they cannot both be true at the same time. Therefore, the conclusion must be true, which is that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
