The conclusion follows logically from the premises, but the premises are false.\n\nThe first premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. This is a false statement, as it is possible for the truck to be metal even if the doll is plastic.\n\nThe second premise states that it is not the case that the truck must have been metal. This is a true statement, as it is possible for the truck to be made of other materials.\n\nThe conclusion states that the doll was not plastic. This follows logically from the premises, as the first premise is false and the second premise is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
