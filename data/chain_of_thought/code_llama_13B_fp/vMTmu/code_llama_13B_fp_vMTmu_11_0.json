The first premise states that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. The second premise states that it is not the case that the muffins must be blueberry. The conclusion states that the cake is not chocolate.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it is impossible for the cake to be chocolate and the muffins to be blueberry. If the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry, but the second premise states that this is not the case. Therefore, the conclusion that the cake is not chocolate is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
