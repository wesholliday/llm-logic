The first premise states that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den. The second premise states that it is not the case that the wolf must have been in the den. The conclusion states that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it is possible for the bear to be in the cave without the wolf being in the den. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
