The first premise states that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. The second premise states that it is not the case that the pants must have been denim. The conclusion states that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it is based on the principle of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot both be true and false at the same time. In this case, the first premise and the second premise are contradictory, which means that the conclusion must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
