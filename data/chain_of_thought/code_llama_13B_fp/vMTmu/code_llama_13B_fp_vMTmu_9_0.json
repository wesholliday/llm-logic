            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt,\" and the premises are \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" and \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premises and the conclusion. The first premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This means that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then it is not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nThe second premise states that it is not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This means that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nThe conclusion states that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This is logically consistent with the premises, since if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then it is not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
