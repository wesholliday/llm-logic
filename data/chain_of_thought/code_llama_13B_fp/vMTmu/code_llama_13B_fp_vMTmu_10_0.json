            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premises and the conclusion. The first premise states that if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside. This premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the 'then') is true. In this case, the antecedent is 'the dog was inside', and the consequent is 'the cat must have been outside'.\n\nThe second premise states that it is not the case that the cat must have been outside. This premise is a negation of the first premise, which means that it is only true if the first premise is false.\n\nThe conclusion states that the dog was not inside. This conclusion is a negation of the first premise, which means that it is only true if the first premise is false.\n\nNow, let's examine the argument in more detail. If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside. This means that if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside. However, it is not the case that the cat must have been outside. Therefore, the dog was not inside.\n\nIn this case, the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. The conclusion is true only if the premises are true, and the premises are true only if the conclusion is true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
