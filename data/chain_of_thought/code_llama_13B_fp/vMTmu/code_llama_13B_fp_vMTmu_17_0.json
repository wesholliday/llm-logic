            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premises and conclusion and determine whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad. This premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the 'then') is true. In this case, the antecedent is 'Ben ate pasta', and the consequent is 'Kate must have eaten salad'.\n\nThe second premise states that it is not the case that Kate must have eaten salad. This premise is a negation of the first premise, which means that it is only true if the first premise is false.\n\nThe conclusion states that Ben did not eat pasta. This conclusion is a negation of the first premise, which means that it is only true if the first premise is false.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premises and conclusion and determine whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In this case, the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises if the first premise is false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid if the first premise is false.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
