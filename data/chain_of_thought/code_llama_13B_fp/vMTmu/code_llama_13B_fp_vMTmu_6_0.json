            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premises and conclusion and determine whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. This premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the 'then') is true. In this case, the antecedent is 'Sue chose pizza', and the consequent is 'Bob must have chosen pasta'.\n\nThe second premise states that it is not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta. This premise is a negation of the first premise, which means that it is only true if the first premise is false.\n\nThe conclusion states that Sue did not choose pizza. This conclusion is a negation of the first premise, which means that it is only true if the first premise is false.\n\nNow, let's examine whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. If the first premise is true, then the second premise is false, which means that the first premise is false. Therefore, the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
