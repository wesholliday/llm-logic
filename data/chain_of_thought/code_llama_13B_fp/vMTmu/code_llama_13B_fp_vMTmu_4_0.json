The first premise states that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter. The second premise states that it is not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter. The conclusion states that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it is a valid argument from a contradiction. The first premise and the second premise are contradictory, which means that they cannot both be true at the same time. Therefore, the conclusion must be true, which is that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
