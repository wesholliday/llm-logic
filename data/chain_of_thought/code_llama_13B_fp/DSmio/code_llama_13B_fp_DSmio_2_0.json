            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given information is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that is only true under certain conditions. In this case, the condition is that the book is not resting on the table.\n\nThe first statement, \"The book might not be resting on the table,\" is a statement that is true regardless of whether the book is on the shelf or not. It simply states that the book might not be resting on the table, which means that it could be on the shelf or it could be somewhere else.\n\nThe second statement, \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table,\" is a statement that is only true if the book is on the shelf. It states that if the book is not resting on the table, then it must be on the shelf.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can infer that the book is on the shelf. This is because the first statement does not provide any information about the book's location, and the second statement only applies if the book is not resting on the table. Therefore, if the book is not resting on the table, then it must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
