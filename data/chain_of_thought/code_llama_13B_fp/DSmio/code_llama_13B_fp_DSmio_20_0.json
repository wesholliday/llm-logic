In this case, the condition is that the sunglasses are either in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag, we need to consider the condition. If the sunglasses are in her bag, then the statement is true. However, if the sunglasses are not in her bag, then the statement is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the sunglasses are in her bag based solely on the given information. The statement is only true if the sunglasses are in her bag, and if they are not in her bag, then the statement is false.\n\nAnswer: No",
