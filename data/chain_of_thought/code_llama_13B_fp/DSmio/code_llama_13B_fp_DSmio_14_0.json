Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\n\nTo infer that the milk is on the counter, we need to analyze the given information and determine whether it is possible for the milk to be on the counter based on the information provided.\n\nFirst, we need to consider the possibility that the milk is not chilling in the fridge. If this is the case, then the milk must be on the counter. Therefore, we can infer that the milk is on the counter if the milk is not chilling in the fridge.\n\nHowever, we also know that either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge. This means that if the milk is not on the counter, it must be chilling in the fridge. Therefore, we cannot infer that the milk is on the counter based solely on the given information.\n\nIn conclusion, we cannot infer that the milk is on the counter based on the given information. The answer is no.",
