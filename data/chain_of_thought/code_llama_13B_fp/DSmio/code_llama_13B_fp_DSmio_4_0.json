Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom.\n\nTo infer that the cat is napping on the couch, we need to use the given information in a logical way.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the cat is playing in the bedroom. Since the cat might not be playing in the bedroom, it is not playing in the bedroom.\n\nSecond, we can conclude that the cat is either napping on the couch or not playing in the bedroom. Since the cat is either napping on the couch or not playing in the bedroom, it is not playing in the bedroom.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
