Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\n\nTo infer that the watch is charging on the dresser, we need to analyze the information provided and determine whether it is possible for the watch to be charging on the dresser.\n\nFirst, we need to consider the possibility that the watch is not on his wrist. If the watch is not on his wrist, then it must be on the dresser, as the second statement suggests. Therefore, if the watch is not on his wrist, we can infer that it is charging on the dresser.\n\nHowever, the first statement also suggests that the watch might not be on his wrist. This means that it is possible for the watch to be on his wrist, in which case it would not be charging on the dresser.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the watch is charging on the dresser based solely on the given information. The answer is 'no'.",
