            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The concert might be sold out and feature a famous band\" implies that the two clauses are connected by a logical conjunction \"and\". This conjunction suggests that both conditions are being met simultaneously. Therefore, if the concert features a famous band, it is likely that it might be sold out, as famous bands often have a high demand for their concerts, leading to sold-out events. This inference is based on the common association between the popularity of a band and the likelihood of a concert being sold out.\n\nAnswer: yes"
