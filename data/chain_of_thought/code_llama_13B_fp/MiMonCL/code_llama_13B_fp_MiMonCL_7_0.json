            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a conditional inference, where we are given a statement that implies another statement. The original statement \"The investment might be risky and offer high returns\" is a compound sentence, where \"might be risky\" and \"offer high returns\" are two independent clauses joined by \"and\". This suggests that the investment has two possible characteristics: it might be risky, and it might offer high returns. The use of \"and\" implies that both characteristics are possible, but not necessarily both at the same time. Therefore, we can infer that the investment might be risky, as it is one of the possible characteristics mentioned.\n\nAnswer: yes"
