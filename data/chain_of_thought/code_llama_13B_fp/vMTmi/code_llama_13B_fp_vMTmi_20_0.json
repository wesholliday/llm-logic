            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premises and the conclusion.\n\nPremise 1: If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\nPremise 2: The banana might not have been yellow.\nConclusion: The apple was not red.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises if we can establish that the premises are true. In this case, the premises are:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\n2. The banana might not have been yellow.\n\nThe first premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. This means that if the apple was not red, then the banana might not have been yellow. However, the second premise states that the banana might not have been yellow, which contradicts the first premise. Therefore, the premises are not logically consistent, and the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
