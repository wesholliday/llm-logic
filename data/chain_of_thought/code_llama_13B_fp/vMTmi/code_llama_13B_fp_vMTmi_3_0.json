The first premise states that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. The second premise states that the book might not be a mystery novel. The conclusion states that the book was not written by James.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it is possible for the book to be written by James but not be a mystery novel. This is a contradiction, which means that the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
