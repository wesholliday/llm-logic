            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it is a form of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens is a logical rule that states that if a conclusion follows from a premise, and the opposite of the conclusion follows from the opposite of the premise, then the premise is true.\n\nIn this case, the first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. The second premise states that Sue might not have been at the wedding. The conclusion states that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because the first premise implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. The second premise states that Sue might not have been at the wedding, which is the opposite of the first premise. Therefore, the conclusion that Mary was not at the wedding follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
