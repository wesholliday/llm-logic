The first premise states that if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside. The second premise states that the cat might not have been outside. The conclusion states that the dog was not inside.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because the first premise is a necessary condition for the conclusion, and the second premise is a sufficient condition for the conclusion. This means that if the first premise is true and the second premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
