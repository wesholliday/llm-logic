In this case, the conclusion is \"Sue did not choose pizza\" and the premises are \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\" and \"Bob might not have chosen pasta.\"\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premises and the conclusion. The first premise states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. This means that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob might not have chosen pasta. However, the second premise states that Bob might not have chosen pasta, which contradicts the first premise. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
