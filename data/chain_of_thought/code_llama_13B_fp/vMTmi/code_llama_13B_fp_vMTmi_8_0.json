            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it is a form of argument from non-contradiction. The first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake. The second premise states that the mummy might not have been awake. The conclusion states that the vampire was not awake.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it is impossible for the vampire to be awake and the mummy not to be awake at the same time. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake, and if the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
