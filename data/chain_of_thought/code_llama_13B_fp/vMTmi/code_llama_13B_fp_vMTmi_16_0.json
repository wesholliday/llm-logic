The first premise states that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. The second premise states that the pants might not have been denim. The conclusion states that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it is possible for the shirt to be cotton and the pants to not be denim. However, if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim by the first premise. Therefore, the second premise is contradictory to the first premise, which means that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
