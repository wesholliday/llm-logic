The first premise states that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den. The second premise states that the wolf might not have been in the den. The conclusion states that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it is based on the principle of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot both be true and false at the same time. In this case, the first premise and the second premise are contradictory, which means that the conclusion must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
