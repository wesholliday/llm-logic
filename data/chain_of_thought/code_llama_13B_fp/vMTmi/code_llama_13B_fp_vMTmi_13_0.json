In this case, the conclusion is \"The car was not red\" and the premises are \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\" and \"The truck might not have been blue.\"\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premises and the conclusion. The first premise states that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. This means that if the car was not red, then the truck might not have been blue. However, the second premise states that the truck might not have been blue. This means that the conclusion \"The car was not red\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
