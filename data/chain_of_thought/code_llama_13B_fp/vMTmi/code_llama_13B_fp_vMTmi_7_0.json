The first premise states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race. This is a conditional statement, which means that the conclusion is only true if the premise is true. The second premise states that Chris might not have finished the race. This is a negative statement, which means that the conclusion is only true if the premise is false. The conclusion states that Alex did not finish the race. This is a negative statement, which means that the conclusion is only true if the premise is false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it is a valid argument from a conditional premise to a negative conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
