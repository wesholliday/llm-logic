Either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled.\n\nTo infer that the sprocket is cranked, we need to show that the sprocket is not daggled. However, the first premise states that it is not the case that the sprocket must be daggled, which means that it is not necessarily the case that the sprocket is daggled. Therefore, we cannot infer that the sprocket is cranked based solely on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
