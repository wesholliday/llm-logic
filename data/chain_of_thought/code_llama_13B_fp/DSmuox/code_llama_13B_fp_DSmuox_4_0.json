The first premise states that it is not the case that the fribble must be crinked. This means that the fribble is not necessarily crinked, but it could be. The second premise states that either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked. This means that either the fribble is snurgled or it is crinked.\n\nSince we know that the fribble is not necessarily crinked, we can conclude that it is not necessarily snurgled either. Therefore, we cannot infer that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: No",
