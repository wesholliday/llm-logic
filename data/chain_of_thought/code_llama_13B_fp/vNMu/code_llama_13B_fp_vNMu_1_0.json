            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise. In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premise and conclusion and determine whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nThe premise is 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.' This means that it is not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n\nThe conclusion is 'Mary might not have been at the wedding.' This means that Mary might not have been at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's examine whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise. If the premise is true, then it is not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding. However, this does not necessarily mean that Mary might not have been at the wedding. There could be other reasons why Mary might not have been at the wedding, such as she was not invited or she had a prior commitment.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion 'Mary might not have been at the wedding' does not necessarily follow from the premise 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.' Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
