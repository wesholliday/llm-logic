In this case, the conclusion 'Sue might not have chosen pizza' does not necessarily follow from the premise 'It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza'.\n\nThe premise 'It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza' means that it is not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza, but it does not necessarily mean that Sue might not have chosen pizza. There are other possibilities, such as Sue might have chosen pizza but it is not the case that she must have chosen pizza.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
