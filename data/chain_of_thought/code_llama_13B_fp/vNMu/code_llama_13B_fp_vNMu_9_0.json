In this case, the conclusion 'Lisa might not have bought the red shirt' does not necessarily follow from the premise 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt'.\n\nThe premise 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt' means that it is not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt. However, this does not necessarily mean that Lisa might not have bought the red shirt. It is possible that Lisa did buy the red shirt, but it is not the case that she must have done so.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
