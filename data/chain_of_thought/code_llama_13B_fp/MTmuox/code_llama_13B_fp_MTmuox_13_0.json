If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged.\n\nTo infer 'The glip was not slogged', we need to apply the rules of logic. Specifically, we need to use the rule of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot both be true and false at the same time.\n\nIn this case, the first premise states that the glip must not have tragged, which means that the glip was not slogged. However, the second premise states that if the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged. This creates a contradiction, as the first premise states that the glip was not slogged, but the second premise states that the glip must have tragged if it was slogged.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The glip was not slogged' from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
