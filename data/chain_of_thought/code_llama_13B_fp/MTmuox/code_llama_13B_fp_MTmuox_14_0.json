The first statement states that \"it's not the case that the clug must have been snugged.\" This means that the clug was not snugged.\n\nThe second statement states that \"if the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged.\" This means that if the clug was fleeked, then it must have been snugged.\n\nHowever, the first statement already tells us that the clug was not snugged. Therefore, we can conclude that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
