If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink.\n\nTo infer 'The grommet was not sploffed', we need to use the rules of logic to deduce the conclusion from the premises.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the negation of the conclusion. The negation of 'The grommet was not sploffed' is 'The grommet was sploffed'.\n\nNext, we need to identify the contrapositive of the second premise. The contrapositive of 'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink' is 'If the grommet did not plopped the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed'.\n\nNow, we can use the contrapositive of the second premise to deduce the negation of the conclusion. If the grommet did not plopped the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed. Therefore, we can infer that 'The grommet was not sploffed'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
