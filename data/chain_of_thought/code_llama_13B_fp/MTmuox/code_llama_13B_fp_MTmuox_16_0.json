This statement is a negation of the second statement, \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink.\"\n\nThe second statement, \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink,\" means that if the sneg was crampled, then it must have sproted the frink. This statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the first part of the statement is true.\n\nSince the first statement is a negation of the second statement, it means that the first statement is true if and only if the second statement is false. This means that if the sneg was crampled, then it is not true that the sneg must have sproted the frink.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the sneg was not crampled from the given statements. The statements do not provide enough information to make this inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
