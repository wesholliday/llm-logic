The first statement states that \"it's not the case that the wug must have bimmed the zoint,\" which means that the wug did not bim the zoint. The second statement states that \"if the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint,\" which means that if the wug was flooped, it would have bimmed the zoint.\n\nSince the first statement states that the wug did not bim the zoint, and the second statement states that if the wug was flooped, it would have bimmed the zoint, we can conclude that the wug was not flooped.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
