The first premise states that it is not the case that the smonk must have plagged. This means that the smonk did not plagiarize. The second premise states that if the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagiarized. This means that if the smonk was vreebled, then it must have plagiarized.\n\nHowever, the first premise and the second premise are contradictory. If the smonk did not plagiarize, then it cannot have been vreebled. Therefore, we cannot infer that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer: No",
