The first statement states that it is not the case that the dreb must have been spened. This means that the dreb was not spened.\n\nThe second statement states that if the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened. This means that if the dreb was vroombed, then it was also spened.\n\nSince we know that the dreb was not spened, we can conclude that it was not vroombed. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: yes",
