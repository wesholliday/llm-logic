The first statement states that it is not the case that the fleeg must have been surned, which means that the fleeg was not surned. The second statement states that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned. However, this statement is not necessarily true, as the fleeg may have been bluttered but not surned.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the fleeg was not bluttered from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
