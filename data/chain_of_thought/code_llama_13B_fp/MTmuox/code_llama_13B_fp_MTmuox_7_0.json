If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked.\n\nTo infer that the whiffle was not shanked, we need to show that the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, we need to show that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the conclusion is \"The whiffle was not shanked.\" The premises are:\n\n1. It's not the case that the whiffle must have tinked.\n2. If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked.\n\nTo show that the conclusion follows logically from the premises, we need to show that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. In other words, we need to show that if the whiffle did not tinkle, and if the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle did not tinkle.\n\nThis is a valid argument, because if the whiffle was shanked, then it must have tinked. Therefore, if the whiffle did not tinkle, then it was not shanked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
