If the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed.\n\nTo infer 'The flug was not blummed', we need to apply the rules of logic. Specifically, we need to use the rule of modus tollens, which states that if a conclusion follows from a premise, and the premise is false, then the conclusion must also be false.\n\nIn this case, the premise is 'If the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed', and the conclusion is 'The flug was not blummed'. If we assume that the premise is true, then we can infer that the conclusion must also be true. However, since the premise is actually false, we can conclude that the conclusion must also be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The flug was not blummed' from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
