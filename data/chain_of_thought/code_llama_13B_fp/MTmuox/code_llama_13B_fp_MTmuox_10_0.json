The first premise states that it is not the case that the wug must have been garpled. This means that the wug was not garpled.\n\nThe second premise states that if the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled. This means that if the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\n\nSince we know that the wug was not garpled, we can conclude that it was not sproinged. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: yes",
