If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger must have been smoogled.\n\nTo infer that the zinger was not fraggled, we need to use the law of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot both be true and false at the same time. In this case, the first premise states that the zinger must not have been smoogled, while the second premise states that if the zinger was fraggled, then it must have been smoogled. If we assume that the zinger was fraggled, then we can conclude that it must have been smoogled, which contradicts the first premise. Therefore, we can infer that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
