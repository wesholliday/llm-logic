The first premise states that it is not the case that the fribble must have crinked. This means that the fribble did not crinkle. The second premise states that if the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked. This means that if the fribble was snurgled, it would have crinkled.\n\nSince we know that the fribble did not crinkle, we can conclude that it was not snurgled. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: yes",
