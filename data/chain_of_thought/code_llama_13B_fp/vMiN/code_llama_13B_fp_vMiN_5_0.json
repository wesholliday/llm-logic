In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premise and conclusion and determine whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nThe premise is 'Jeff might not have played basketball'. This means that it is possible that Jeff did not play basketball, but it does not necessarily mean that he did not play basketball.\n\nThe conclusion is 'It's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball'. This means that it is not the case that Jeff must have played basketball, which is a stronger statement than the premise.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise, and the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
