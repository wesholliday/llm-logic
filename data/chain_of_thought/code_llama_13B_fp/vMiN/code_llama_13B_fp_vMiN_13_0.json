The premise states that the toy might not be in the toy box, which means that it is possible that the toy is not in the toy box. The conclusion then states that it is not the case that the toy must be in the toy box, which means that it is not necessarily true that the toy is in the toy box. This conclusion follows logically from the premise because it is possible that the toy is not in the toy box, which means that it is not necessarily true that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
