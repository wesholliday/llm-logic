In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premise and conclusion and determine whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nThe premise is 'The sunglasses might not be in her bag'. This means that it is possible that the sunglasses are not in her bag.\n\nThe conclusion is 'It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag'. This means that it is not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\nNow, let's examine whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise. If the sunglasses might not be in her bag, then it is not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag. This means that the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
