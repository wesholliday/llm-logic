In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premise and conclusion and determine whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nThe premise is 'Mary might not have been at the wedding'. This means that it is possible that Mary was not at the wedding, but it does not necessarily mean that she was not at the wedding.\n\nThe conclusion is 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding'. This means that it is not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding, which is the opposite of the premise.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premise, and the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
