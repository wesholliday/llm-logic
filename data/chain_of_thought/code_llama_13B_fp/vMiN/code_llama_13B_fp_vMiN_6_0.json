In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premise and conclusion and determine whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nThe premise is 'Sue might not have chosen pizza'. This means that it is possible that Sue did not choose pizza, but it does not necessarily follow that she did choose pizza.\n\nThe conclusion is 'It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza'. This means that it is not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza, which is the opposite of the premise.\n\nSince the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
