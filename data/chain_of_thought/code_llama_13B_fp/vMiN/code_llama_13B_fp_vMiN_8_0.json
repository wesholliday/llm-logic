In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premise and conclusion and determine whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nThe premise of the argument is 'The vampire might not have been awake.' This means that the vampire could have been asleep or not awake.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is 'It's not the case that the vampire must have been awake.' This means that it is not the case that the vampire must have been awake.\n\nNow, let's examine whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise. If the vampire might not have been awake, then it is not the case that the vampire must have been awake. This means that the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
