In this case, the premise of the argument is that the scarf might not be stuffed in the backpack, which implies that it is possible for the scarf to be stuffed in the backpack. However, the conclusion of the argument is that it is not the case that the scarf must be stuffed in the backpack, which implies that it is possible for the scarf not to be stuffed in the backpack.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it is based on a true premise and a logical conclusion.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
