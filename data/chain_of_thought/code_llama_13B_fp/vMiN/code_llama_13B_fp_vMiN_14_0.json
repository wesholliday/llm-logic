In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premise and conclusion and determine whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nThe premise is 'The milk might not be on the counter.' This means that the possibility of the milk not being on the counter exists.\n\nThe conclusion is 'It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter.' This means that the possibility of the milk being on the counter does not exist.\n\nThe conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premise. The possibility of the milk not being on the counter exists, but the possibility of the milk being on the counter also exists. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: No",
