In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premise and conclusion and determine whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nThe premise is 'The newspaper might not be in the driveway.' This means that the newspaper is not necessarily in the driveway, but it could be or it could not be.\n\nThe conclusion is 'It's not the case that the newspaper must be in the driveway.' This means that it is not the case that the newspaper must be in the driveway, which means that it is possible for the newspaper not to be in the driveway.\n\nSince the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
