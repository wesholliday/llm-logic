'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding'\n2. 'Sue was at the wedding'\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n3. 'Mary was at the wedding'\n\nWe can start by examining the first premise. This premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. This means that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nNext, we can examine the second premise. This premise states that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nNow, we can use the first premise to determine whether Mary was at the wedding. If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding. However, we know that Sue was at the wedding, so we can conclude that Mary was also at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes. Mary was at the wedding.",
