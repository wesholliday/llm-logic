'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train'\n2. 'Erin took a train'\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n3. 'Sam took a plane'\n\nWe can use a truth table to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\n| Premise 1 | Premise 2 | Conclusion |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| T | T | T |\n| T | F | F |\n| F | T | F |\n| F | F | F |\n\nSince the first row of the truth table indicates that the conclusion follows from the premises, we can conclude that 'Sam took a plane' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
