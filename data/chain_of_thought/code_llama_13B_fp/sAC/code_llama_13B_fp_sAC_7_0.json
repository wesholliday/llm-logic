The first premise states that 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' is true. This means that if Alex finished the race, then it is also true that Chris finished the race.\n\nThe second premise states that 'Chris finished the race' is true. This means that Chris did in fact finish the race.\n\nNow, we need to consider the conclusion. The conclusion is that 'Alex finished the race' is true. This means that we need to determine whether Alex did in fact finish the race.\n\nTo determine whether Alex finished the race, we need to examine the first premise again. The first premise states that 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' is true. This means that if Alex finished the race, then it is also true that Chris finished the race.\n\nSince we know that Chris finished the race, we can conclude that Alex must have also finished the race. Therefore, the conclusion that 'Alex finished the race' is true follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
