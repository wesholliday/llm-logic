            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether 'The book was written by James' is true, we need to evaluate the argument based on the given premises. The first premise states that 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.' This premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the 'then') is true. In this case, the antecedent is 'The book was written by James.'\n\nThe second premise states that 'The book is a mystery novel.' This premise is a simple statement, which means that it is always true.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises. The conclusion is 'The book was written by James.' To determine whether this conclusion follows from the premises, we need to evaluate whether the premises are sufficient to establish the conclusion.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent is true. However, the second premise is a simple statement, which means that it is always true. Therefore, the second premise does not provide any information about whether the book was written by James.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that 'The book was written by James' is true based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
