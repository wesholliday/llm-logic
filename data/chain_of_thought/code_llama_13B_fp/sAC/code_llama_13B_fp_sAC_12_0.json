'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' is true.\n2. 'Lucy went to the zoo' is true.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n1. 'Joe went to the park' is true.\n\nTo determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises, we need to examine whether the premises logically entail the conclusion. In other words, we need to determine whether the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises.\n\nTo do this, we can use a logical analysis of the premises and the conclusion. We can start by examining the first premise:\n\n1. 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' is true.\n\nThis premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that is true if a certain condition is met. In this case, the condition is that Joe went to the park. If Joe went to the park, then the conclusion that Lucy went to the zoo is true.\n\nNext, we can examine the second premise:\n\n2. 'Lucy went to the zoo' is true.\n\nThis premise is a simple statement that is either true or false. In this case, the statement is true.\n\nNow, we can examine the conclusion:\n\n1. 'Joe went to the park' is true.\n\nThis conclusion is a simple statement that is either true or false.
