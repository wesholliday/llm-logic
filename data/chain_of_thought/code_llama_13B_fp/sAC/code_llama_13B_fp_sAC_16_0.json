However, we are not given any information about the shirt, so we cannot conclude that it was cotton.\n\nThe statement 'The pants were denim' is also true, which means that the pants were indeed denim.\n\nSince we cannot conclude that the shirt was cotton based on the information provided, we cannot say that 'The shirt was cotton' is true.\n\nAnswer: No",
