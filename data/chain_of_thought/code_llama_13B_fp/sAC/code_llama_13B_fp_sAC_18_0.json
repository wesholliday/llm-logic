If the statement is true, then we can conclude that 'The doll was plastic' is true. However, we also know that 'The truck was metal' is true, which suggests that the statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' is false. Therefore, we cannot conclude that 'The doll was plastic' is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
