            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that expresses a relationship between two events. The statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" can be written as \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" or \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\"\n\nThe first statement is a positive statement, which means that it is a statement that expresses a fact or a truth. The second statement is a negative statement, which means that it is a statement that expresses a lack of something or a contradiction.\n\nIn this case, the first statement is a positive statement, which means that it is a statement that expresses a fact or a truth. The second statement is a negative statement, which means that it is a statement that expresses a lack of something or a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta\" from the given statement. The given statement is a positive statement, which means that it is a statement that expresses a fact or a truth. The second statement is a negative statement, which means that it is a statement that expresses a lack of something or a contradiction.\n\nAnswer: No",
