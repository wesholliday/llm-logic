            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that expresses a relationship between two events. The statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" can be read as \"If Joe went to the park, then it is necessarily true that Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nTo infer the opposite of this statement, we need to negate both the antecedent and the consequent. The negation of \"If Joe went to the park\" is \"If Joe did not go to the park,\" and the negation of \"then Lucy went to the zoo\" is \"then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\" Therefore, the negation of the original statement is \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
