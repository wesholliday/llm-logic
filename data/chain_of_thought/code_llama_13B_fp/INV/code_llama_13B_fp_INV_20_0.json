            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement. It means that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. However, this statement does not necessarily mean that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\n\nTo see why, let's consider an example. Suppose the apple is red, and the banana is yellow. In this case, the statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is true. However, if the apple is not red, then the banana could still be yellow. So, the statement \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow\" is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
