            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a logical implication, which means that if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true. In this case, the premise is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This means that if Mary was at the wedding, then it is certain that Sue was also at the wedding.\n\nHowever, the question asks us to infer whether the opposite of the premise is also true. In other words, if Mary was not at the wedding, then is it also true that Sue was not at the wedding?\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the possibility that Mary was not at the wedding, but Sue was still there. This would mean that the premise \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is not true, since Mary was not at the wedding, but Sue was.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\" is also true. The conclusion does not logically follow from the premise, and we cannot make this inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
