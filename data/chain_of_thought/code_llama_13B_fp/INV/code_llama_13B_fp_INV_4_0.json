In this case, the condition is that the alien visited Mars.\n\nIf we assume that the alien visited Mars, then we can infer that the robot visited Jupiter. This is because the statement is a conditional statement, and the condition is that the alien visited Mars. If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the alien did not visit Mars, then we cannot infer that the robot did not visit Jupiter. This is because the statement is a conditional statement, and the condition is that the alien visited Mars. If the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: No",
