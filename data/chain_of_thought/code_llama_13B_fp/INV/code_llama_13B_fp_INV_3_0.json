In this case, the condition is that the book was written by James. If the book was written by James, then the statement is true, and we can infer that the book is a mystery novel.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer that if the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel. This is because the statement only applies to books written by James, and there may be other books that are not written by James but are still mystery novels.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no, we cannot infer that if the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.",
