            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that expresses a relationship between two events. The statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" can be written as \"If P, then Q\", where P is the event \"Sam took a plane\" and Q is the event \"Erin took a train\".\n\nTo infer the opposite of the given statement, we need to negate both the antecedent and the consequent. The negation of \"Sam took a plane\" is \"Sam did not take a plane\", and the negation of \"Erin took a train\" is \"Erin did not take a train\". Therefore, the negation of the given statement is \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
