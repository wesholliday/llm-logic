In this case, the condition is that the vampire is awake. If the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer that if the vampire is not awake, then the mummy is not awake. This is because the statement only applies when the vampire is awake, and it does not say anything about what happens when the vampire is not awake.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no, we cannot infer that if the vampire is not awake, then the mummy is not awake.",
