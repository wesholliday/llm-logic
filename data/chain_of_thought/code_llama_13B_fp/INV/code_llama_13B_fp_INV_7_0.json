In this case, the condition is that Alex finished the race.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that if Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that is only true if a certain condition is met. In this case, the condition is that Alex finished the race.\n\nThe second statement is also a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that is only true if a certain condition is met. In this case, the condition is that Chris finished the race.\n\nThe relationship between the two statements is that they are both conditional statements, and they both have the same condition (Alex finishing the race). This means that if the first statement is true, then the second statement is also true.\n\nHowever, if the first statement is false (i.e., Alex didn't finish the race), then the second statement is also false (i.e., Chris didn't finish the race).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
