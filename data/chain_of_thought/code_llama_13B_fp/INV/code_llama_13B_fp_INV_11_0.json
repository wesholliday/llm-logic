In this case, the condition is that the cake is chocolate. If the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry.\n\nHowever, the question asks us to infer whether the following statement is true: \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\" This is a different statement than the original one, and it is not necessarily true.\n\nTo determine whether this statement is true, we need to consider all the possible cases. If the cake is not chocolate, then it could be any other type of cake, such as vanilla or strawberry. In this case, the muffins could still be blueberry, so the statement \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry\" is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no, we cannot infer that \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry\" from the given statement.",
