In this case, the condition is that the doll is plastic. If the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal.\n\nHowever, the question asks us to infer whether the statement 'If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal' is true. To do this, we need to consider the opposite of the original statement.\n\nIf the doll was not plastic, then it could be made of any other material, such as wood or fabric. If the truck was not metal, then it could be made of any other material, such as plastic or wood.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that 'If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal' is true. The statement is not necessarily true, and we cannot make any conclusions about the material of the truck based on the fact that the doll is not plastic.\n\nAnswer: No",
