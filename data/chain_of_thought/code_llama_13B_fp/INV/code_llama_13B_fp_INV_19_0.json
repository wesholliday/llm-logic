            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that expresses a relationship between two events. The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" can be written in symbolic form as:\n\nTom watched football \u2192 Jen watched basketball\n\nThis statement is a conditional statement because it expresses a relationship between two events, where the event \"Tom watched football\" is the antecedent (the condition) and the event \"Jen watched basketball\" is the consequent (the consequence).\n\nTo infer the opposite of the given statement, we need to negate both the antecedent and the consequent. The negation of the antecedent is \"Tom did not watch football\", and the negation of the consequent is \"Jen did not watch basketball\". Therefore, the opposite of the given statement is:\n\nTom did not watch football \u2192 Jen did not watch basketball\n\nAnswer: Yes",
