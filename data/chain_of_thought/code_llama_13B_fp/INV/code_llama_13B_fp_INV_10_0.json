In this case, the condition is that the dog is inside. If the dog is inside, then the cat is outside.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer that if the dog is not inside, then the cat is not outside. This is because the statement only applies when the dog is inside, and it does not say anything about what happens when the dog is not inside.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no, we cannot infer that if the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside.",
