In this case, the condition is that the shirt is cotton. If the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim.\n\nHowever, the question asks us to infer whether the following statement is true: \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\" This is a different statement than the original one, and it is not necessarily true.\n\nTo see why, let's consider a counterexample. Suppose that the shirt is not cotton, but the pants are still denim. In this case, the original statement is true (the shirt is not cotton, but the pants are denim), but the inferred statement is false (the shirt was not cotton, but the pants were denim).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim\" is true from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
