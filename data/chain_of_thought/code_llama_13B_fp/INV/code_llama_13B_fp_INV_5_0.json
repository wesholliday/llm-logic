The statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" can be written in symbolic form as:\n\nJeff played basketball \u2192 Amy played tennis\n\nThis statement is a conditional statement because it expresses a relationship between two events, where the event \"Jeff played basketball\" is the antecedent (the condition) and the event \"Amy played tennis\" is the consequent (the consequence).\n\nTo infer the opposite of the given statement, we need to negate both the antecedent and the consequent. The negation of the antecedent is \"Jeff did not play basketball\", and the negation of the consequent is \"Amy did not play tennis\".
