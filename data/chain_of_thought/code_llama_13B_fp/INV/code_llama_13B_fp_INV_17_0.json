In this case, the statement is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This means that if Ben ate pasta, then it is certain that Kate ate salad.\n\nTo infer the opposite of this statement, we need to flip the \"if-then\" structure. This means that we need to change the \"if\" to \"if not\" and the \"then\" to \"then not.\" So, the opposite of the given statement would be \"If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
