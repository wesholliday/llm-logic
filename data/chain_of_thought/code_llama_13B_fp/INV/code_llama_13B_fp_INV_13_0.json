In this case, the condition is that the car is red. If the car is red, then the truck is blue.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer that if the car is not red, then the truck is not blue. This is because the statement only applies to the case where the car is red, and it does not provide any information about what happens when the car is not red.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no, we cannot infer that if the car is not red, then the truck is not blue.",
