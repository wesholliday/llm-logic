            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'The truck was blue' from 'The car was red' together with 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue', we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement, 'The car was red', is a simple statement of fact. It does not contain any logical operators or connectives, and it does not make any claims about the color of the truck.\n\nThe second statement, 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue', is a conditional statement. It uses the logical operator 'then' to indicate that if the first part of the statement is true, then the second part of the statement must also be true. In this case, the first part of the statement is 'The car was red', and the second part of the statement is 'The truck was blue'.\n\nNow, we need to consider whether we can infer 'The truck was blue' from the two statements. To do this, we need to determine whether the second statement is a logical consequence of the first statement.\n\nIf the first statement is true, then the second statement must also be true. In this case, if the car was red, then the truck must also be blue. Therefore, we can infer that 'The truck was blue' from 'The car was red' together with 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
