The bear was in the cave.\n2. If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n1. The wolf was in the den.\n\nTo determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises, we need to analyze the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. In this case, the conclusion logically follows from the premises because the second premise states that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. Since the first premise states that the bear was in the cave, we can logically conclude that the wolf was also in the den.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
