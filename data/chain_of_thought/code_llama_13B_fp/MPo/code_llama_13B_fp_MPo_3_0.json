To do this, we need to analyze the logical relationships between the statements.\n\nThe first statement provides us with the author of the book, but it does not tell us anything about the genre of the book. The second statement, on the other hand, provides us with the genre of the book, but it does not tell us anything about the author.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the book is a mystery novel from the first statement alone. The second statement provides us with the necessary information to make the inference, but the first statement does not.\n\nAnswer: No",
