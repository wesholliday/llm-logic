The second statement, 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta', is a conditional statement that implies a logical relationship between the two choices.\n\nThe question is whether we can infer 'Bob chose pasta' from the given information. To do this, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nIf we assume that the second statement is true, then we can infer that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. However, this does not necessarily mean that Bob chose pasta. It only means that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Bob chose pasta' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
