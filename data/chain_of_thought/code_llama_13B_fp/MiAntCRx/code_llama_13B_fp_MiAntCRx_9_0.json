The word 'might' indicates a possibility or uncertainty, and 'frazzle' is a verb that means to become disheveled or confused. \n\nHowever, the word 'quibble' is a noun that refers to a petty or trivial complaint, and it doesn't seem to be related to the verb 'frazzle' in this context. The phrase 'quibble and frazzle' is a combination of two unrelated words, and there is no logical connection between them based on the given statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The flonk might be quibble and frazzle' from 'The flonk might be frazzle'.\n\nAnswer: no"
