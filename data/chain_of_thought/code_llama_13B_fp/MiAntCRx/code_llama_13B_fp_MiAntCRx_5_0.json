The word \"might\" indicates that the statement is speculative or uncertain. The phrase \"wobble and grooble\" is a separate characteristic that is not mentioned in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that the flimble might be wobble and grooble based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
