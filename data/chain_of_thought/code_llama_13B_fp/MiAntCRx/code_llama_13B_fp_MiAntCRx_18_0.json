The original statement 'The flump might be wozzle' implies that there is a possibility that the flump is wozzle. However, it does not provide any information about whether the flump is also blurble. In fact, the original statement does not mention blurble at all. Therefore, we cannot infer that the flump might be blurble and wozzle from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
