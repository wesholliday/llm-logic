The first statement says that either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it's under the bed. The second statement says that the missing sock isn't under the bed.\n\nBased on this information, we can't infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket. The second statement contradicts the first statement, as it says that the missing sock isn't under the bed, which means it's not in the laundry basket either. Therefore, we can't infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: No",
