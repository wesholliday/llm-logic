This means that the shoes are not in the location where they would be lined up by the door, which is the location where they are not.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shoes are in the closet. The only location where the shoes could be is in the closet, since they are not in the location where they would be lined up by the door.\n\nAnswer: yes",
