The statement states that either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand. Additionally, it is also stated that the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the notebook is not in the nightstand. However, we cannot infer that the notebook is in the drawer without more information. The statement only provides us with the possibility that the notebook is in the drawer or on the nightstand, but it does not rule out the possibility that the notebook is in another location.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the notebook is in the drawer based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
