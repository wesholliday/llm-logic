            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the book is on the shelf from the given information, we need to carefully consider the relationships between the different statements.\n\nThe first statement, \"Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table,\" suggests that the book is either on the shelf or on the table. This implies that the book is not in a third location, such as on the floor or in someone's hand.\n\nThe second statement, \"The book isn't resting on the table,\" further narrows down the possibilities. If the book is on the table, then it is not resting on the table. This means that the book is either on the shelf or not on the table at all.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can infer that the book is on the shelf. The only way for the book to be on the table is if it is resting on the table, which is not the case according to the second statement. Therefore, the book must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
