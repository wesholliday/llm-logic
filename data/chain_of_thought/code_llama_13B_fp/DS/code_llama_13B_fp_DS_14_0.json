The second statement, \"The milk isn't chilling in the fridge,\" tells us that the milk is not in the fridge.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that the milk is either on the counter or not in the fridge. However, we don't know for sure whether the milk is on the counter or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that the milk is on the counter from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
