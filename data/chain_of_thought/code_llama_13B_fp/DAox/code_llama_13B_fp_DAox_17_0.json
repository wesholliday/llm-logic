'Skizzled' means to be scratched or scraped, while 'movated' means to be moved or transported.\n\nNext, we need to analyze the given information. 'The flob was not skizzled' means that the flob was not scratched or scraped. 'If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated' means that if the flob was scratched or scraped, then it would be moved or transported.\n\nNow, we can see that the given information does not provide any information about whether the flob was moved or transported. The only thing we know is that the flob was not scratched or scraped. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The flob was not movated' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
