'The shank was not plooked': This statement is true, as the shank was not looked at.\n2. 'If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged': This statement is also true, as if the shank was looked at, then it was nugged.\n\nNow, let's use logical reasoning to infer 'The shank was not nugged':\n\n1. If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged. (True)\n2. The shank was not plooked. (True)\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The shank was not nugged'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
