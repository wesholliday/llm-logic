The first statement states that the dreb was not vroombed, and the second statement states that if the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\n\nWe can start by assuming that the dreb was vroombed, based on the second statement. If the dreb was vroombed, then it would be spened, according to the second statement. However, the first statement states that the dreb was not vroombed, which contradicts the assumption that the dreb was vroombed.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the dreb was not spened, based on the information provided in the two statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
