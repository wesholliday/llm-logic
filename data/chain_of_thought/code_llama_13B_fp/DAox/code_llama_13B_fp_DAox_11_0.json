However, they are not necessarily contradictory statements.\n\n'The flug was not blummed' simply states that the flug was not blummed, while 'If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed' is a conditional statement that implies that if the flug was blummed, then it would also be zimmed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The flug was not zimmed' from 'The flug was not blummed' together with 'If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed'.\n\nAnswer: no",
