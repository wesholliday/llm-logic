The first statement, 'The clug was not fleeked', tells us that the clug was not in a state of being fleeked. The second statement, 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged', tells us that if the clug was in a state of being fleeked, then it would also be in a state of being snugged.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not tell us anything about the state of being snugged if the clug was not fleeked. Therefore, we cannot infer that the clug was not snugged based solely on the information provided in the two statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
