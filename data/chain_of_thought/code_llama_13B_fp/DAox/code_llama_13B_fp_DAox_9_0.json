In this case, the condition is that the twonk was plinked.\n\nIf we assume that the twonk was not plinked, then we can infer that it was not varnished. This is because the statement 'If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished' is only true if the twonk was plinked. If the twonk was not plinked, then it is not true that the twonk was varnished.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the twonk was not varnished, given that it was not plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
