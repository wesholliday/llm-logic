'The fribble was not snurgled' means that the fribble was not snurgled, and 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked' means that if the fribble was snurgled, then it would crink.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationships between these statements. If the fribble was not snurgled, then it cannot be snurgled, and therefore, it cannot crink. However, if the fribble was snurgled, then it would crink. Therefore, we cannot infer that the fribble did not crink from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
