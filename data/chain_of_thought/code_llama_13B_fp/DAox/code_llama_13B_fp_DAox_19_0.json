'Vreebled' means to be disturbed or agitated, while 'plagged' means to be annoyed or bothered.\n\nNext, we need to analyze the given information. The first statement, 'The smonk was not vreebled', means that the smonk was not disturbed or agitated. The second statement, 'If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged', means that if the smonk was disturbed or agitated, then it would be annoyed or bothered.\n\nNow, we can see that the two statements are not contradictory. If the smonk was not vreebled, then it was not disturbed or agitated, which means it was not annoyed or bothered. Therefore, we cannot infer that the smonk was not plagged from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
