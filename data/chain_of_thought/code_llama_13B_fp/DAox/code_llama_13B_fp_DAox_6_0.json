The first statement states that the grommet did not sploff, and the second statement states that if the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nWe can start by assuming that the grommet did not sploff, as stated in the first statement. If the grommet did not sploff, then it is not possible for the grommet to plop the frink, as the second statement only applies if the grommet was sploffed. Therefore, we can conclude that the grommet did not plop the frink.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
