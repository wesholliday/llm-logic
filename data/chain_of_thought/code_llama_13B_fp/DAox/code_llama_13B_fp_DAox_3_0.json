            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"The splat was not morphed\" implies that the splat did not undergo any changes in its shape or form. If the splat was morphed, then it would have undergone some kind of change in its shape or form. Therefore, if the splat was morphed, then it would not have remained in its original state, which is what the statement \"The splat was not morphed\" implies.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" implies that if the splat underwent any kind of change in its shape or form, then it would also quank. Quanking is a hypothetical action that is not defined in the context of the question. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the splat quanking based on the statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\".\n\nAnswer: No",
