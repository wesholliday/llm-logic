The second statement, 'If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint', means that if the wug was flooped, then it would have bimmed the zoint.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not necessarily imply that the wug did not bim the zoint. It only states that if the wug was flooped, then it would have bimmed the zoint. Therefore, we cannot infer that the wug did not bim the zoint from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
