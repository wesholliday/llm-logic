It is a possibility that the fribble was not snurgled, but it is not necessarily the case.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The fribble might not have been snurgled\" from \"It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled.\" The two statements are not equivalent, and we cannot draw a conclusion about the possibility of the fribble not being snurgled based solely on the negation of the statement that it must have been snurgled.\n\nAnswer: No",
