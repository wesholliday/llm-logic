For example, if the speaker was discussing a hypothetical scenario in which the shank was not plooked, then we could infer that the shank might not have been plooked. However, if the speaker was discussing a real-world scenario in which the shank was plooked, then we could not infer that the shank might not have been plooked.\n\nAnswer: No",
