It is a possibility that the glip was not slogged, but it is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The glip might not have been slogged\" from \"It's not the case that the glip must have been slogged.\" The two statements are not equivalent, and we cannot draw a conclusion about the possibility of the glip not being slogged based solely on the negation of the statement that it must have been slogged.\n\nAnswer: No",
