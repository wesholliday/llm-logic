For example, if the speaker was discussing a hypothetical scenario in which the flugel was not blimmed, then we could infer that the flugel might not have been blimmed. However, if the speaker was discussing a specific instance in which the flugel was blimmed, then we could not infer that the flugel might not have been blimmed.\n\nAnswer: No",
