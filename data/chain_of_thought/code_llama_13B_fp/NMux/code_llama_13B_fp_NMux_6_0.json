For example, if the speaker was discussing a hypothetical scenario in which the grommet was not sploffed, then we could infer that the grommet might not have been sploffed. However, if the speaker was discussing a real-world scenario in which the grommet was sploffed, then we could not infer that the grommet might not have been sploffed.\n\nAnswer: No",
