This statement does not necessarily imply that the zinger might not have been fraggled.\n\nFor example, if we know that the zinger was not fraggled, then we can infer that it is not the case that the zinger must have been fraggled. However, we cannot infer that the zinger might not have been fraggled, because we do not know for certain whether the zinger was or was not fraggled.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no. We cannot infer that the zinger might not have been fraggled from the statement \"It's not the case that the zinger must have been fraggled.\"",
