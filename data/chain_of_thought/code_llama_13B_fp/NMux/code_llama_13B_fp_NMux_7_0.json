This statement does not provide any information about whether or not the whiffle was shanked, only that it is not necessarily the case that it was.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The whiffle might not have been shanked\" from this statement. The statement only provides a negative statement about the possibility that the whiffle was shanked, but it does not provide any information about whether or not it was shanked.\n\nAnswer: No",
