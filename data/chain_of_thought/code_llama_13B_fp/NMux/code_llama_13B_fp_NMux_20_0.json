However, this statement does not necessarily imply that the fleeg might not have been bluttered.\n\nTo infer that the fleeg might not have been bluttered, we would need more information about the fleeg and the circumstances surrounding its bluttering. For example, if we knew that the fleeg was in a location where it was unlikely to have been bluttered, or if we knew that the fleeg had a history of not being bluttered, then we could infer that it might not have been bluttered.\n\nHowever, without more information, we cannot infer that the fleeg might not have been bluttered. The statement \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered\" simply asserts that the fleeg was not bluttered, and does not provide any evidence or reasoning to support the inference that the fleeg might not have been bluttered.\n\nAnswer: No",
