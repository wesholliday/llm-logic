This statement does not necessarily imply that the sneg might not have been crampled.\n\nFor example, if we know that the sneg was not crampled, then we can infer that it is not the case that the sneg must have been crampled. However, this does not necessarily mean that the sneg might not have been crampled.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no. We cannot infer that the sneg might not have been crampled from the statement \"It's not the case that the sneg must have been crampled.\"",
