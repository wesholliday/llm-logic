For example, if the speaker was discussing a hypothetical scenario in which the flug was not blummed, then we could infer that the flug might not have been blummed. However, if the speaker was discussing a real-world scenario in which the flug was blummed, then we could not infer that the flug might not have been blummed.\n\nAnswer: No",
