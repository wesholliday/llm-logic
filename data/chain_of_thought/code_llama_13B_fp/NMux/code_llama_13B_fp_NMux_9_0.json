This statement does not necessarily imply that the twonk might not have been plinked.\n\nFor example, if we know that the twonk was not plinked, then we can infer that it is not the case that the twonk must have been plinked. However, this does not necessarily mean that the twonk might not have been plinked, as there could be other reasons why it was not plinked.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no. We cannot infer that the twonk might not have been plinked from the statement \"It's not the case that the twonk must have been plinked.\"",
