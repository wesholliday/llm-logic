This statement does not necessarily imply that the wug might not have been flooped.\n\nFor example, if we know that the wug was not flooped, then we can infer that it is not the case that the wug must have been flooped. However, this does not necessarily mean that the wug might not have been flooped.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no. We cannot infer that the wug might not have been flooped from the statement \"It's not the case that the wug must have been flooped.\"",
