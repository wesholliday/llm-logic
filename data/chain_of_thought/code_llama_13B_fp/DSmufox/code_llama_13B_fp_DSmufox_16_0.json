The first premise states that it is not the case that the sneg must be sproted, which means that it is not necessarily the case that the sneg is sproted. The second premise states that either the sneg must be sproted or it is crampled, which means that if the sneg is not sproted, then it must be crampled.\n\nSince we know that the sneg is not sproted (from the first premise), we can conclude that it must be crampled (from the second premise). Therefore, we can infer that the sneg is crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
