The question states that \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked\" and \"Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the splat is not quanked. However, the second statement suggests that either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed. This means that if the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
