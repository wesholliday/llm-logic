The argument is based on a conditional statement, which is a type of argument that is often used to infer a conclusion from a premise.\n\nThe premises are:\n\n1. 'It's not the case that the glip must be tragged'\n2. 'Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged'\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n'The glip is slogged'\n\nTo determine whether we can infer the conclusion from the premises, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument. The argument is based on a conditional statement, which is a type of argument that is often used to infer a conclusion from a premise.\n\nThe first premise states that the glip must not be tragged. This means that the glip is not tragged.\n\nThe second premise states that either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged. This means that if the glip is not tragged, then it must be slogged.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the glip is slogged from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
