This means that the grommet is not necessarily plopped, but it could be.\n\nThe second premise states that 'Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed.' This means that either the grommet is plopped or it is sploffed.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible logical relationships between these premises:\n\n1. If the grommet is not necessarily plopped, then it could be sploffed. In this case, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n2. If the grommet is plopped, then it is not necessarily sploffed. In this case, we cannot infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the grommet is sploffed from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
