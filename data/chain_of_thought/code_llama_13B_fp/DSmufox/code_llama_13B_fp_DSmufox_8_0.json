The argument is based on a conditional statement, which is a type of argument that is often used to infer a conclusion from a premise.\n\nThe premises are:\n\n1. 'It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled'\n2. 'Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked'\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n'The sprocket is cranked'\n\nTo determine whether we can infer the conclusion from the premises, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument. The argument is based on a conditional statement, which is a type of argument that is often used to infer a conclusion from a premise.\n\nThe first premise states that the sprocket is not daggled, which means that it is not in a state of disrepair. The second premise states that either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked. This means that if the sprocket is not daggled, then it must be cranked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sprocket is cranked from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
