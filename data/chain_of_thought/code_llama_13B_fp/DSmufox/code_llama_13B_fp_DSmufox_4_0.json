The first premise states that it is not the case that the fribble must be crinkled. This means that the fribble is not necessarily crinkled, but it could be. The second premise states that either the fribble must be crinkled or it is snurgled. This means that if the fribble is not crinkled, then it must be snurgled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
