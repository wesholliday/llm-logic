The first premise states that \"it's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" This means that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nThe second premise states that \"if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" This means that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must also be in the forest.\n\nSince we know that the unicorn was not in the forest, we can conclude that the griffin was not in the forest either. Therefore, we can infer that \"the griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
