If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nTo infer 'Tom did not watch football', we need to apply the rules of logic. Specifically, we need to use the rule of modus tollens, which states that if a conclusion follows from a premise, and the opposite of the conclusion follows from the opposite of the premise, then the premise is false.\n\nIn this case, the conclusion is 'Jen must have watched basketball', which follows from the premise 'If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball'. The opposite of the conclusion is 'Jen did not watch basketball', which follows from the premise 'It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'Tom did not watch football' by applying the rule of modus tollens to the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
