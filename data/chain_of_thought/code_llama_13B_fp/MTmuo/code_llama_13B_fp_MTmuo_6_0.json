If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\nTo infer that Sue did not choose pizza, we need to find a way to contradict the second premise. One way to do this is to assume that Sue did choose pizza, and then show that this assumption leads to a logical contradiction.\n\nAssuming that Sue chose pizza, we can substitute this into the second premise to get:\n\nIf Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\nHowever, this statement is logically equivalent to:\n\nIf Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\nSo, if we assume that Sue chose pizza, we can infer that Bob must have chosen pasta, which contradicts the first premise. Therefore, we can conclude that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
