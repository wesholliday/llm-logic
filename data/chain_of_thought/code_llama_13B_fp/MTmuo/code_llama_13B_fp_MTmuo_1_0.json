If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\n\nTo infer that Mary was not at the wedding, we need to use the law of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time.\n\nIn this case, the first premise states that Sue must not have been at the wedding, which means that Sue was not at the wedding. However, the second premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding, because the second premise contradicts the first premise.\n\nAnswer: No",
