The first statement, \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry,\" tells us that the muffins are not necessarily blueberry. The second statement, \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry,\" tells us that if the cake is chocolate, the muffins must be blueberry.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not tell us that the cake is chocolate. It only tells us that if the cake is chocolate, the muffins must be blueberry. Therefore, we cannot infer that the cake was not chocolate based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No",
