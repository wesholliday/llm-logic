If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n\nTo infer 'Sam did not take a plane', we need to use the rules of logic. Specifically, we need to use the rule of modus tollens, which states that if a conditional statement is true and its negation is false, then the antecedent of the conditional statement must be true.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train'. The negation of this statement is 'It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train'. Since the premises are true, we can apply the rule of modus tollens to infer that 'Sam did not take a plane'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
