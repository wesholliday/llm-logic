If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\n\nTo infer 'Jeff did not play basketball', we need to use a logical rule called modus tollens. This rule states that if a conditional statement is true, and its negation is false, then the antecedent of the conditional statement must be true.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis'. The negation of this statement is 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy did not play tennis'.\n\nSince we know that 'It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis', we can conclude that 'Amy did not play tennis'. Therefore, we can infer that 'Jeff did not play basketball'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
