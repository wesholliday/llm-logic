If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nTo infer 'Joe did not go to the park', we need to find a way to use the given premises to reach a conclusion that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nOne way to do this is to assume that Joe did go to the park, and then use the second premise to deduce that Lucy must have gone to the zoo. However, since the first premise states that Lucy must not have gone to the zoo, this would lead to a contradiction. Therefore, we can conclude that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
