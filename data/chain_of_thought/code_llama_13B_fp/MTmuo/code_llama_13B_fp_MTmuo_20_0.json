The first premise states that 'It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow', which means that the banana could have been any color, including yellow. The second premise states that 'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow', which means that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\n\nHowever, the second premise does not imply that the apple was red. It only states that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The apple was not red' from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
