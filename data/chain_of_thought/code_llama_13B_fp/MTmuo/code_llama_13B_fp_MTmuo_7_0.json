If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\n\nTo infer that Alex did not finish the race, we need to assume that Chris did not finish the race. This is because the second premise states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race. Therefore, if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race either.\n\nHowever, the first premise states that it's not the case that Chris must have finished the race. This means that Chris did not have to finish the race, and therefore, we cannot conclude that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Alex did not finish the race from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
