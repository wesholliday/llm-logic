We can do this by using the fact that the pants must have been denim to contradict the statement that the pants were not denim.\n\nIf the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. This means that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. However, we are given the information that the pants must have been denim, which contradicts the statement that the pants were not denim. Therefore, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
