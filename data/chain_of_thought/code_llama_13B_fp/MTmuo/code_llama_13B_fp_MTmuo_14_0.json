The first statement tells us that the wolf was not in the cave, but it does not tell us anything about the bear's location. The second statement tells us that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den. However, this statement does not tell us anything about the bear's location.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the bear was not in the cave based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
