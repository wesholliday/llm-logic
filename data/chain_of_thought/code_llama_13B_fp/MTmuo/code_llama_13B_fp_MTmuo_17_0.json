If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\n\nTo infer 'Ben did not eat pasta', we need to use the rules of logic. Specifically, we need to use the rule of modus tollens, which states that if a conditional statement is true and its negation is false, then the antecedent of the conditional statement must be true.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad'. The negation of this statement is 'It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad'. Since the premises are true, we can apply the rule of modus tollens to infer that 'Ben did not eat pasta'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
