If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\n\nTo infer that \"The book was not written by James,\" we need to apply the rules of logic. Specifically, we need to use the rule of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot both be true and false at the same time.\n\nIn this case, the first premise states that the book must not be a mystery novel, which means that it cannot be a mystery novel. However, the second premise states that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. This creates a contradiction, as the first premise states that the book cannot be a mystery novel, but the second premise states that it must be a mystery novel if it was written by James.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The book was not written by James\" from the given premises. The premises are logically inconsistent, and we cannot draw any conclusions from them.\n\nAnswer: No",
