If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\n\nTo infer 'The car was not red', we need to apply the rules of logic. Specifically, we need to use the rule of modus tollens, which states that if a conditional statement is true and its negation is false, then the antecedent of the conditional statement must be true.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is 'If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue'. The negation of this statement is 'It's not the case that the truck must have been blue'. Since the negation of the conditional statement is false, we can conclude that the antecedent of the conditional statement must be true, which is 'The car was red'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The car was not red' from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
