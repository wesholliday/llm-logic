In this case, the condition is that Ben ate pasta, and the statement is that Kate ate the salad.\n\nTo infer the second statement, we need to reverse the condition and the statement. This means that we need to take the opposite of the condition and the statement.\n\nIn this case, the opposite of the condition is that Ben did not eat pasta, and the opposite of the statement is that Kate did not eat the salad.\n\nTherefore, the inferred statement is:\n\nIf Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
