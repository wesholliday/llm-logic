In this case, the condition is that the apple is red. If the apple is red, then the banana is yellow.\n\nHowever, the question asks us to infer a new statement from the given statement. To do this, we need to find a new statement that is logically equivalent to the given statement.\n\nOne way to do this is to use the law of excluded middle, which states that a statement is either true or false. In this case, we can use the law of excluded middle to say that if the banana is not yellow, then the apple is not red.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the banana is not yellow, then the apple is not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
