In this case, the condition is that the bear is in the cave.\n\nTo infer the opposite of the given statement, we need to find the opposite of the condition. In this case, the opposite of \"the bear was in the cave\" is \"the bear was not in the cave\".\n\nTherefore, the opposite of the given statement is \"If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
