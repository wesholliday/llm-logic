            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a logical implication, which means that if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true. In this case, the premise is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This means that if Mary was at the wedding, then it is also true that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nHowever, the conclusion \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\" is not necessarily true. This conclusion is a logical implication, but it is not necessarily a valid one.\n\nFor example, suppose that Mary and Sue were both at the wedding, but they were not in the same room at the same time. In this case, the premise \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" would be true, but the conclusion \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\" would not be true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
