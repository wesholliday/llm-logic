In this case, the statement is \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This means that if the car was red, then it is also the case that the truck was blue.\n\nTo infer the opposite of the given statement, we need to negate both the antecedent and the consequent. In this case, the antecedent is \"the car was red\" and the consequent is \"the truck was blue.\" To negate these, we would change them to \"the car was not red\" and \"the truck was not blue.\"\n\nTherefore, the negation of the given statement is \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\" This statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, but it is the negation of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
