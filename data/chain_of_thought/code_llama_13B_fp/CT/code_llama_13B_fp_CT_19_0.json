            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that expresses a relationship between two events. The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" can be written in symbolic form as:\n\nTom watched football \u2192 Jen watched basketball\n\nThis statement is a conditional statement because it expresses a relationship between two events, where the event \"Tom watched football\" is the antecedent (the condition) and the event \"Jen watched basketball\" is the consequent (the consequence).\n\nTo infer the opposite of the given statement, we need to reverse the direction of the implication. In other words, we need to change the direction of the arrow from \"\u2192\" to \"\u2190\". This will give us the opposite of the given statement, which is:\n\nJen did not watch basketball \u2192 Tom did not watch football\n\nThis statement is also a conditional statement, but it expresses the opposite relationship between the two events.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
