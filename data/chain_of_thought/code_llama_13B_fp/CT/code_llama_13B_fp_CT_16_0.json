In this case, the condition is that the shirt is cotton. If the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim.\n\nHowever, the question asks us to infer whether the following statement is true: \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\" This statement is a conditional statement, but it is the opposite of the original statement. It is a statement that is only true if the opposite condition is met.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the statement \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton\" is true from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
