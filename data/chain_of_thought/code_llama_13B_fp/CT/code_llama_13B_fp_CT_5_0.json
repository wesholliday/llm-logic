            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that expresses a relationship between two events. The statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" can be written in symbolic form as:\n\nJeff played basketball \u2192 Amy played tennis\n\nThis statement is a conditional statement because it expresses a relationship between two events, where the event \"Jeff played basketball\" is the antecedent (the condition) and the event \"Amy played tennis\" is the consequent (the consequence).\n\nTo infer the opposite of the given statement, we need to reverse the direction of the implication. In other words, we need to change the direction of the arrow from \"\u2192\" to \"\u2190\". This will give us the opposite of the given statement, which is:\n\nAmy did not play tennis \u2192 Jeff did not play basketball\n\nThis statement is also a conditional statement, but it expresses a relationship between two events in the opposite direction.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
