However, the statement \"If I fertilize the lawn and there is a drought, it will be lush and green\" is not a causal statement, as it does not provide any information about the relationship between fertilizing the lawn and the presence of a drought.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if I fertilize the lawn and there is a drought, it will be lush and green. The statement is ambiguous and does not provide enough information to make a conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No",
