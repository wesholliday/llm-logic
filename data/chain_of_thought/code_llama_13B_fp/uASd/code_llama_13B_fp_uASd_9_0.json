While a well-written essay is generally considered a positive factor in determining a student's grade, there are many other factors that can influence the final grade. For example, the teacher's grading criteria, the student's understanding of the material, and the overall quality of the essay can all impact the grade.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the essay was turned in late can also impact the grade. If the essay is well-written but turned in late, the teacher may be more likely to give a lower grade, as the student may not have had enough time to complete the essay to the best of their ability.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to infer that if the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A. The grade a student receives is influenced by a variety of factors, and the quality of the essay is just one of them.",
