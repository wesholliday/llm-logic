It means that if we go to the concert, then we will have a good time. However, the statement \"If a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time\" is a different statement altogether. It is not a conditional statement, but rather a statement about the consequences of a bomb going off.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time. The two statements are not related, and the second statement does not follow logically from the first.\n\nAnswer: No",
