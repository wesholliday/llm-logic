However, the statement \"If the match is struck and it has been soaked in water, then it will light\" is not a causal statement, as it does not imply a causal relationship between the soaking of the match in water and its lighting.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the match is struck and it has been soaked in water, then it will light.\n\nAnswer: no",
