It means that if the package has been shipped, then it will arrive today. However, this statement does not necessarily mean that if the package has been misrouted, it will still arrive today.\n\nTo determine whether the package will arrive today, we need to consider the specific circumstances of the package's delivery. If the package has been misrouted, it may take longer to arrive, or it may not arrive at all. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the package has shipped and it was misrouted, it will still arrive today.\n\nAnswer: No",
