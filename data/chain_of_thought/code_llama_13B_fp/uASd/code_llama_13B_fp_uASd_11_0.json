It implies that if you get enough sleep, you will not feel tired. However, the statement \"If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired\" is a different statement altogether. It implies that if you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you will not feel tired.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer that if you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you will not be tired based solely on the first statement. The first statement only suggests a causal relationship between sleep and tiredness, and it does not provide any information about the effects of hard labor on tiredness. Therefore, we cannot conclude that if you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you will not be tired based solely on the first statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
