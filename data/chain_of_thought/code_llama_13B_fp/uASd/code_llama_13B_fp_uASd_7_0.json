However, the statement \"If the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm\" is not a causal statement, as it does not provide any information about the cause of the kitchen being warm.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm.\n\nAnswer: no",
