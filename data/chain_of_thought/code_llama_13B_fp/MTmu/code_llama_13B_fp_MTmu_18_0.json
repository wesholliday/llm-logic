            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the doll was not plastic from the given information, we need to carefully consider the relationships between the different statements.\n\nThe first statement, \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal,\" suggests that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. This implies that if the doll is not plastic, then the truck is not necessarily metal.\n\nThe second statement, \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal,\" suggests that the truck is not necessarily metal, regardless of whether the doll is plastic or not. This implies that the truck could be anything, including plastic.\n\nBased on these statements, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic. The first statement only implies that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal, but it does not rule out the possibility that the truck is plastic. The second statement only implies that the truck is not necessarily metal, but it does not provide any information about the truck's material.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
