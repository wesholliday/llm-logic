            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the shirt was not cotton from the given information, we need to carefully consider the logical relationships between the statements.\n\nThe first statement, \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim,\" is a conditional statement. It means that if the shirt was cotton, then it is necessarily true that the pants must have been denim.\n\nThe second statement, \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim,\" is a negation of the first statement. It means that it is not the case that the pants must have been denim.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical relationships between these two statements. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. However, it is not the case that the pants must have been denim. This means that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
