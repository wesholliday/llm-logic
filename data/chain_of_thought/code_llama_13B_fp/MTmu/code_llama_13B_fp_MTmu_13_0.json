It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\n\nTo infer that the car was not red, we need to use the first premise to deduce that the car was not red. However, the second premise tells us that the truck was not blue, which does not necessarily imply that the car was not red.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the car was not red from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
