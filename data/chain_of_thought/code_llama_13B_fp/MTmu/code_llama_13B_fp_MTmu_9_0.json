            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, we need to consider the information provided in the premises. The first premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. The second premise states that it's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nBased on these premises, we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This is because the first premise implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. However, the second premise states that it's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. Therefore, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
