It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nTo infer that the cake was not chocolate, we need to use the first premise to deduce that the cake was not chocolate. However, the second premise tells us that the muffins were not blueberry, which does not necessarily imply that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the cake was not chocolate from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
