We also have the information that the vampire was awake and the mummy must have been awake.\n\nUsing the given information, we can conclude that the vampire was awake and the mummy must have been awake. However, we also have the information that the mummy must not have been awake. This means that the mummy was not awake, which contradicts the fact that the mummy must have been awake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the vampire was not awake. The information given does not allow us to make this conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
