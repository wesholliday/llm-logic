            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that Tom did not watch football from the given premises, we need to examine the logical relationships between the statements.\n\nThe first premise states that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. This means that if Tom did not watch football, then we cannot infer that Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. This means that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nNow, we can use the first premise to reason that if Tom did not watch football, then we cannot infer that Jen must have watched basketball. Therefore, we cannot infer that Tom did not watch football from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
