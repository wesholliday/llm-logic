It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nTo infer that Joe did not go to the park, we need to use the first premise to deduce that Joe did not go to the park. However, the second premise tells us that Lucy did not go to the zoo, which does not necessarily mean that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Joe did not go to the park from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
