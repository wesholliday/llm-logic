We can do this by using the contrapositive of the first statement, which is \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nSince we know that Sue must not have been at the wedding, we can conclude that Sue was not at the wedding. Therefore, we can use the contrapositive to infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
