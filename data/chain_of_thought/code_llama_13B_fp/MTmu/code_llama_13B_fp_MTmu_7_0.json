It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race.\n\nTo infer that Alex did not finish the race, we need to use the first premise to deduce that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race. (Premise 1)\n2. It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race. (Premise 2)\n\nFrom the first premise, we can conclude that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris must not have finished the race either. This is because the first premise states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race. If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris must not have finished the race, as the first premise does not allow for the possibility that Chris finished the race while Alex did not.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race, as the second premise states that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
