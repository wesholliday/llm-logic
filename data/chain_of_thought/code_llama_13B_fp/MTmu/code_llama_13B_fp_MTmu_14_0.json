The first premise states that \"if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\" This means that if the bear was in the cave, then it is necessary that the wolf must have been in the den.\n\nThe second premise states that \"it's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den.\" This means that it is not the case that the wolf must have been in the den. However, this does not necessarily mean that the wolf was not in the den. It is possible that the wolf was in the den, but it is not necessary that it was there.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that the bear was not in the cave. The premises do not provide enough information to make this conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No",
