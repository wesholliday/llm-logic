In this case, the condition is that the book was written by James.\n\nTo infer the second statement, we need to reverse the condition and the conclusion. This means that we need to take the conclusion of the first statement (the book is a mystery novel) and make it the condition of the second statement.\n\nTherefore, the second statement would be: \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
