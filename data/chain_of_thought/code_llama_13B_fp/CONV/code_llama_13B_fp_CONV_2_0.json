However, this does not necessarily mean that if the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was also in the forest.\n\nIn other words, the statement is not a logical equivalence, which means that it does not imply that the two statements are equivalent. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was also in the forest.\n\nAnswer: No",
