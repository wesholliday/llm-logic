            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a logical implication, which means that if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true. In this case, the premise is \"Lisa bought the red shirt,\" and the conclusion is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt,\" we need to consider the logical structure of the implication. An implication is a statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is the premise and Q is the conclusion.\n\nIn this case, the premise is \"Lisa bought the red shirt,\" and the conclusion is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" If we assume that the premise is true, then we can infer that the conclusion must also be true. However, this does not necessarily mean that the conclusion implies the premise.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
