In this case, the condition is that the bear was in the case.\n\nTo infer the second statement, we need to reverse the condition and the conclusion. This means that we need to take the conclusion of the first statement (the wolf was in the den) and make it the condition of the second statement.\n\nHowever, this is not always possible, as the conclusion of the first statement may not be a condition that can be reversed. In this case, the conclusion of the first statement is that the wolf was in the den, which is not a condition that can be reversed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no",
