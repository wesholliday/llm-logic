It means that if the dog was inside, then it is necessarily true that the cat was outside. In other words, if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside, and there is no possibility that the cat was inside.\n\nThe second statement, \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside,\" is also a conditional statement. It means that if the cat was outside, then it is necessarily true that the dog was inside. In other words, if the cat was outside, then the dog was inside, and there is no possibility that the dog was outside.\n\nNow, we need to consider whether the two statements are logically equivalent. In other words, do they have the same meaning?
