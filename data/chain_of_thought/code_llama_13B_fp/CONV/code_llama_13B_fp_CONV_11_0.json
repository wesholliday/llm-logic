In this case, the condition is that the cake is chocolate. If the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that if the muffins are blueberry, then the cake is chocolate. This is because the statement only implies a relationship between the cake and the muffins, and does not provide any information about the relationship between the muffins and the cake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the muffins are blueberry, then the cake is chocolate.\n\nAnswer: No",
