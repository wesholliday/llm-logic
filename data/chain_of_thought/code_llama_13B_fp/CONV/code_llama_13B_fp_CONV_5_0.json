            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that expresses a relationship between two events. The statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" can be read as \"If Jeff played basketball, then it is necessarily the case that Amy played tennis.\"\n\nTo infer the opposite statement, we need to reverse the order of the events in the conditional statement. This means that we need to change the statement from \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" to \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball.\"\n\nHowever, this new statement is not necessarily true. It is possible that Amy played tennis without Jeff playing basketball, or that Jeff played basketball without Amy playing tennis. Therefore, we cannot infer the opposite statement with certainty.\n\nAnswer: No",
