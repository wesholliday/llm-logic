In this case, the premise is \"Alex finished the race,\" and the conclusion is \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race,\" we need to consider the relationship between the two statements. If the first statement is true, then the second statement must also be true. However, if the second statement is false, then the first statement can still be true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
