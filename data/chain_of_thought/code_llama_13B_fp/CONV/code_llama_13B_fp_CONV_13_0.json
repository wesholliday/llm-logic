            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that expresses a relationship between two events or states. In this case, the statement is \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This means that if the car was red, then it is also the case that the truck was blue.\n\nHowever, the question asks whether we can infer \"If the truck was blue, then the car was red\" from the given statement. To answer this question, we need to consider whether the given statement implies the opposite of the statement we are trying to infer.\n\nIn this case, the given statement does not imply the opposite of the statement we are trying to infer. This is because the given statement only states that if the car was red, then the truck was blue, and it does not state that if the truck was blue, then the car was red. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the truck was blue, then the car was red\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
