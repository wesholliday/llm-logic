The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true. In this case, the antecedent is \"the apple was red,\" and the consequent is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\nThe second statement is also a conditional statement, but it has the antecedent and consequent reversed. So, if we want to infer that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red, we need to consider whether the antecedent and consequent of the second statement are logically equivalent to the antecedent and consequent of the first statement.\n\nIf we look at the antecedent and consequent of the second statement, we see that the antecedent is \"the banana was yellow,\" and the consequent is \"the apple was red.\" These are the same as the antecedent and consequent of the first statement, so we can infer that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
