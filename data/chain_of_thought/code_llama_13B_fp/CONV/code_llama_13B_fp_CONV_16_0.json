However, this does not necessarily mean that if the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton.\n\nThe reason for this is that the implication only goes one way, from shirt to pants. It does not imply that the opposite is also true, from pants to shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton.\n\nAnswer: No",
