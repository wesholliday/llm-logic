However, this does not necessarily mean that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was also awake.\n\nFor example, if the vampire was awake and the mummy was asleep, then the implication would still hold true. However, if the mummy was awake and the vampire was asleep, then the implication would not hold true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was also awake.\n\nAnswer: No",
