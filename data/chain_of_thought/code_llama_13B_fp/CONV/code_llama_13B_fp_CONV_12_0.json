            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that expresses a relationship between two events. The statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" can be read as \"If Joe went to the park, then it is necessarily true that Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nTo infer the opposite of this statement, we need to flip the order of the events. So, we can infer \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park\" by flipping the order of the events in the original statement.\n\nHowever, this inference is not necessarily true. The original statement only implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. It does not imply that if Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park. Therefore, the inference \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park\" is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: No",
