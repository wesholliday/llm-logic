However, this does not necessarily mean that if the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic. This is because the implication only goes in one direction, and there is no guarantee that the opposite implication is also true.\n\nIn other words, just because the doll was plastic does not mean that the truck was metal. There could be other factors at play that determine the material of the truck. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: No",
