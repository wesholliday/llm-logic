It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'The sprocket was not cranked' from these premises, we need to examine the logical relationships between them.\n\nThe first premise states that if the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled. This means that if the sprocket was cranked, then it is necessarily the case that the sprocket was daggled.\n\nThe second premise states that it is not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled. This means that it is not necessarily the case that the sprocket was daggled, even if the sprocket was cranked.\n\nNow, we can use the first premise to infer that if the sprocket was cranked, then it is necessarily the case that the sprocket was daggled. We can also use the second premise to infer that it is not necessarily the case that the sprocket was daggled, even if the sprocket was cranked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The sprocket was not cranked' from these premises. The only conclusion we can draw is that if the sprocket was cranked, then it is necessarily the case that the sprocket was daggled, but we cannot determine whether the sprocket was cranked or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
