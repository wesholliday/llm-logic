The first premise states that if the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened. The second premise states that it's not the case that the dreb must have been spened.\n\nWe can start by analyzing the first premise. If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened. This means that if the dreb was vroombed, then it must have been spened. However, the second premise states that it's not the case that the dreb must have been spened. This means that the dreb was not spened, even if it was vroombed.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
