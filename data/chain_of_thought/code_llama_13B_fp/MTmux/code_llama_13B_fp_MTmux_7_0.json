The first statement says that if the whiffle was shanked, then it must have tinked. The second statement says that it's not the case that the whiffle must have tinked.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that the whiffle was not shanked. This is because the first statement implies that if the whiffle was shanked, then it must have tinked, but the second statement says that it's not the case that the whiffle must have tinked. Therefore, we can infer that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
