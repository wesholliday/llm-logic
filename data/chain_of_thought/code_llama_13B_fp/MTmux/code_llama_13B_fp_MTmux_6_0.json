The statement \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink\" is a logical fallacy, as it is not a valid argument. The statement \"It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink\" does not provide any information about whether the grommet was sploffed or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the grommet was not sploffed based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
