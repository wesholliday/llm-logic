The argument is based on a logical fallacy, specifically, the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nThe fallacy of affirming the consequent occurs when we assume that the conclusion of a conditional statement is true, even if the premise is false. In this case, the premise is \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated,\" and the conclusion is \"The flob was not skizzled.\"\n\nHowever, the premise is not necessarily true, as we are given the additional information that \"It's not the case that the flob must have movated.\" This information contradicts the premise, as it suggests that the flob did not move, even if it was skizzled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The flob was not skizzled\" from the given premises, as the argument is based on a logical fallacy.\n\nAnswer: no",
