The word \"or\" is not present in the original statement, which suggests that the sentence is a single, complete thought. The presence of \"or\" in the proposed inference would introduce an alternative condition that is not supported by the original sentence. Therefore, we cannot infer the presence of \"or\" in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
