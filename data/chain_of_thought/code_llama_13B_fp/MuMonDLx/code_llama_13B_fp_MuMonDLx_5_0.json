This statement implies a necessity or a requirement for the plonk to be quork frozz. It does not provide any information about the plonk being fizzle. The absence of any mention of fizzle in the original statement means we cannot infer that the plonk must be fizzle. The original statement does not provide any logical connection or alternatives to quork frozz, so we cannot infer the plonk must be quork frozz or fizzle.\n\nAnswer: no"
