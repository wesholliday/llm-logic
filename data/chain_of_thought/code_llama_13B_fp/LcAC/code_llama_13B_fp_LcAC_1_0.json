Sue was at the wedding.\n\nTo draw a conclusion that Mary was at the wedding, we need to use the logic of conditional statements. The first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. This means that if we know that Sue was at the wedding, we can infer that Mary was also at the wedding.\n\nHowever, the second premise only states that Sue was at the wedding, and it does not provide any information about Mary's presence at the wedding. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that Mary was at the wedding based solely on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
