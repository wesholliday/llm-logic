The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a logical implication, but it does not necessarily follow that the apple was red. The statement \"The banana was yellow\" does not provide any information about the color of the apple. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that the apple was red based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
