We can't logically conclude that Sam took a plane based on this information alone.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the comma) is true. In this case, the antecedent is 'Sam took a plane', and the consequent is 'Erin took a train'.\n\nThe second statement is a simple statement that Erin took a train.\n\nSince we don't know whether Sam took a plane or not, we can't conclude that he did. Therefore, the answer is no.",
