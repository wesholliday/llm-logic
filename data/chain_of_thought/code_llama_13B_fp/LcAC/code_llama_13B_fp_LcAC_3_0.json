The first premise states that \"if the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This means that if we know that the book is a mystery novel, we can infer that it was written by James.\n\nThe second premise states that \"the book is a mystery novel.\" This is the information that we are given, and it does not provide any information about who wrote the book.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that the book was written by James based on the information provided. The conclusion is not valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
