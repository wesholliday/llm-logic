The first statement tells us that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. The second statement tells us that the mummy was awake.\n\nHowever, the first statement does not tell us that the mummy was awake if the vampire was awake. It only tells us that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that the vampire was awake based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No",
