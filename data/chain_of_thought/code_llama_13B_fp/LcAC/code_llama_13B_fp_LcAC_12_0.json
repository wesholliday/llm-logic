Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nTo draw a conclusion that Joe went to the park, we need to use the given premises in a logical way. We can do this by using a logical deduction, where we start with the given premises and use them to reach a conclusion.\n\nIn this case, we can start by assuming that Joe did not go to the park. This means that Lucy must have gone to the zoo without Joe being there. However, this contradicts the first premise, which states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. Therefore, we can conclude that Joe must have gone to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
