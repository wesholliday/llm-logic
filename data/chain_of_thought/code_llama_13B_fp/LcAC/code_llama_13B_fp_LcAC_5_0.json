Amy played tennis.\n\nTo draw a conclusion that Jeff played basketball, we need to use the given premises in a logical way. We can do this by using a logical deduction, which is a process of reasoning that allows us to draw a conclusion based on a set of given premises.\n\nIn this case, we can use a logical deduction by assuming that Jeff did not play basketball, and then showing that this assumption leads to a logical contradiction.\n\nAssumption: Jeff did not play basketball.\n\n1. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. (Premise 1)\n2. Amy played tennis. (Premise 2)\n\nIf we assume that Jeff did not play basketball, then we can use the given premises to deduce that Amy played tennis. This is because the first premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. Since Jeff did not play basketball, the first premise does not apply, and we can conclude that Amy played tennis.\n\nHowever, this leads to a logical contradiction, because the second premise states that Amy played tennis. Therefore, we can conclude that our assumption that Jeff did not play basketball must be false, and we can conclude that Jeff played basketball.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
