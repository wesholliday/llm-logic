The first premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. The second premise states that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nTo apply the rules of logic, we need to use the rules of inference. In this case, we can use the rule of conditional proof, which states that if the antecedent (the if-part) of a conditional statement is true, then the consequent (the then-part) must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the antecedent is \"Lisa bought the red shirt,\" and the consequent is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" Since we know that Mark bought the blue shirt, we can conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes.",
