However, the second statement contradicts this implication. It states that it's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that Sam did not take a plane based on the given information. The only conclusion we can draw is that the information provided is inconsistent, and we cannot make any definitive statements about Sam's travel mode.\n\nAnswer: No",
