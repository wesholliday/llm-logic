It means that if the cake was chocolate, then it is also true that the muffins were blueberry.\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry\" is a negation of the first statement. It means that it is not true that the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nSince the second statement negates the first statement, we can conclude that the first statement is false. Therefore, we cannot infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no",
