In this case, the condition is that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. However, the statement also says that it is not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta. This means that the condition is not always true, and there may be cases where Bob does not choose pasta even if Sue chose pizza.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Sue did not choose pizza based on the given information. The statement does not provide enough information to make a conclusion about Sue's choice.\n\nAnswer: No",
