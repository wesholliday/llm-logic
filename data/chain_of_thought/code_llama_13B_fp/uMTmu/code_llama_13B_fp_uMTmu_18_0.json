It means that if the doll was plastic, then it is necessarily true that the truck must have been metal. However, the statement \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal\" is a negation of the conditional statement. It means that it is not necessarily true that the truck must have been metal, even if the doll was plastic.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic based on the information provided. The information does not provide enough information to make a conclusion about the material of the doll.\n\nAnswer: no",
