It means that if Ben ate pasta, then it is necessarily true that Kate must have eaten salad.\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad\" is a negation of the conditional statement. It means that it is not the case that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\n\nSince the negation of a conditional statement is not the same as the original statement, we cannot infer that Ben did not eat pasta from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
