It means that if the shirt was cotton, then it is certain that the pants must have been denim. However, the statement \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim\" is a logical contradiction. It means that the pants were not necessarily denim, even if the shirt was cotton.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the shirt was not cotton based on the information provided. The shirt could have been cotton, and the pants could have been denim, or the shirt could have been denim, and the pants could have been cotton. We need more information to make a conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No",
