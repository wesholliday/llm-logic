In this case, the condition is that Lisa bought the red shirt. If this condition is met, then it is also true that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. However, the statement also says that it is not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This means that the condition is not met, and therefore we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
