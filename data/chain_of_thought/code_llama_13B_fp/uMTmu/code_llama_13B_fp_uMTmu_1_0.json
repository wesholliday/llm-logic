In this case, the condition is that Mary was at the wedding. If Mary was at the wedding, then it is also true that Sue must have been at the wedding. However, the statement does not say that Sue must have been at the wedding, it only says that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding based on the given information. The only thing we can say for sure is that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No",
