In this case, the condition is that Joe went to the park. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. However, it is also given that Lucy did not go to the zoo. This creates a contradiction, as the statement \"Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Joe did not go to the park. The statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" is false, which means that we cannot conclude that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: no",
