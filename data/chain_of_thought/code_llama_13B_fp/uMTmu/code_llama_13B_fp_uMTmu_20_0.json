It means that if the apple was red, then it is necessarily true that the banana was yellow. However, the statement \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow\" is a negation of the conditional statement. It means that it is not necessarily true that the banana was yellow, even if the apple was red.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the apple was not red based on the information provided. The apple could have been red, and the banana could have been yellow, or the apple could have been red, and the banana could have been any other color.\n\nAnswer: No",
