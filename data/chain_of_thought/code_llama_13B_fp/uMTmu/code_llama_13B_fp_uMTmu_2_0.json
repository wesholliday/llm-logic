It means that if the griffin was in the forest, then it is also true that the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nHowever, the statement \"it's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest\" is a logical contradiction. It means that it is not true that the unicorn was in the forest, even if the griffin was in the forest.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the griffin was not in the forest based on the information provided. The information is contradictory, and we cannot draw any conclusions about the griffin's location.\n\nAnswer: no",
