            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given information is a classic example of a logical contradiction. The first statement, \"The book isn't resting on the table,\" implies that the book is not on the table. However, the second statement, \"Either the book is resting on the table or it is on the shelf,\" implies that the book is either on the table or on the shelf. Since the first statement rules out the possibility that the book is on the table, the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
