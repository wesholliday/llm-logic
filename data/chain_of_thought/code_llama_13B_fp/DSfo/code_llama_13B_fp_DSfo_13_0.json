The second statement, 'Either the toy is sitting on the shelf or it is in the toy box,' implies that the toy is either on the shelf or in the toy box.\n\nIf we assume that the toy is not on the shelf, then it must be in the toy box. Therefore, we can infer that 'The toy is in the toy box' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
