            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given information is 'Fido is not in the garden' and 'Either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside'. We can infer that Fido is inside by using the principle of excluded middle. The excluded middle states that for any proposition P, either P is true or P is false. In this case, the proposition P is \"Fido is in the garden\". Since we know that Fido is not in the garden, we can conclude that P is false. Therefore, by the excluded middle, we know that \"Fido is not in the garden\" or \"Fido is inside\". Since we know that Fido is not in the garden, we can conclude that \"Fido is inside\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
