This means that the scarf is not in its usual place, which could be either draped on the coat rack or stuffed in the backpack.\n\nThe second statement, \"Either the scarf is draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack,\" tells us that the scarf is either hanging on the coat rack or in the backpack. This means that the scarf is not in its usual place, which could be either draped on the coat rack or stuffed in the backpack.\n\nBased on the information provided, we cannot infer that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack. The scarf could be in either of the two places, and we do not have enough information to determine which one it is in.\n\nAnswer: No",
