The first statement, \"The jacket isn't hanging in the closet,\" implies that the jacket is not in the closet. The second statement, \"Either the jacket is hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair,\" implies that the jacket is either in the closet or draped over the chair. However, the first statement already states that the jacket is not in the closet, which means that the second statement is logically impossible. Therefore, we cannot infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: No",
