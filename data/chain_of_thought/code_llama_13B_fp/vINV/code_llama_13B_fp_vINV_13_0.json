            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise. In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premise and conclusion and determine whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nThe premise is 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'. This means that if the car was red, then it is necessarily the case that the truck was blue.\n\nThe conclusion is 'If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue'. This means that if the car was not red, then it is necessarily the case that the truck was not blue.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise. In other words, we need to determine whether if the car was not red, then it is necessarily the case that the truck was not blue.\n\nTo determine this, we need to consider the possibility that the car was not red but the truck was blue. This would mean that the premise is false, since the car was not red but the truck was blue.\n\nHowever, this is not possible, since the premise states that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. Therefore, the premise is true, and the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
