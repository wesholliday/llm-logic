            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion follows from the premise. In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premise and conclusion and determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nThe premise states that \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that is true if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true and the consequent (the part after the \"then\") is also true.\n\nThe conclusion states that \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\" This statement is also a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that is true if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true and the consequent (the part after the \"then\") is also true.\n\nThe problem with this argument is that the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise. The premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. However, the conclusion states that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis. This is not necessarily true, as there are many other factors that could have caused Amy to not play tennis, such as a personal injury or a scheduling conflict.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid. The conclusion does not logically follow from the premise, and the argument is therefore invalid.\n\nAnswer: No",
