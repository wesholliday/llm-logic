In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premise and conclusion and determine whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nThe premise of the argument is 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter'. This means that if the alien visited Mars, then it is necessarily true that the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is 'If the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter'. This means that if the alien did not visit Mars, then it is necessarily true that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nNow, let's examine the reasoning behind the conclusion. If the alien did not visit Mars, then it is not necessarily true that the robot visited Jupiter. In fact, it is possible that the robot visited Jupiter even if the alien did not visit Mars. Therefore, the conclusion of the argument is not necessarily true, and the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
