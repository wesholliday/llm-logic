In this case, the conclusion is \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal,\" which is a logical implication of the premise \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\n\nHowever, the argument is not logically valid if the conclusion does not follow from the premise. For example, if the premise is \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal,\" and the conclusion is \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal,\" but the truck was actually made of plastic, then the conclusion would not be logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
