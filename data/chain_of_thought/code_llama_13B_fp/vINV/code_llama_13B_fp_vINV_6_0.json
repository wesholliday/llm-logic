            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise. In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premise and conclusion and determine whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nThe premise is 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta'. This means that if Sue chose pizza, then it is necessarily true that Bob chose pasta.\n\nThe conclusion is 'If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta'. This means that if Sue did not choose pizza, then it is necessarily true that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nNow, let's examine the premise and conclusion:\n\n1. The premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that is true only if a certain condition is met. In this case, the condition is that Sue chose pizza.\n2. The conclusion is also a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that is true only if a certain condition is met. In this case, the condition is that Sue did not choose pizza.\n3. The conclusion is the opposite of the premise. If the premise is true, then the conclusion must be false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise. The conclusion is the opposite of the premise, which means that if the premise is true, then the conclusion must be false.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
