In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premise and conclusion and determine whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nThe premise is 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.' This statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that is true if the antecedent (the part before the 'then') is true and the consequent (the part after the 'then') is also true.\n\nThe conclusion is 'If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside.' This statement is also a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that is true if the antecedent (the part before the 'then') is true and the consequent (the part after the 'then') is also true.\n\nNow, let's examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside. This means that the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
