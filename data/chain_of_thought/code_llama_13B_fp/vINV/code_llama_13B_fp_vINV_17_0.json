In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premise and conclusion and determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nThe premise of the argument is 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad'. This means that if Ben ate pasta, then it is necessarily true that Kate ate salad.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is 'If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad'. This means that if Ben did not eat pasta, then it is necessarily true that Kate did not eat salad.\n\nNow, let's examine the reasoning behind the conclusion. If Ben did not eat pasta, then it is not necessarily true that Kate ate salad. In fact, it is possible that Kate did not eat salad even if Ben did not eat pasta. Therefore, the conclusion of the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
