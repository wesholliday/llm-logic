In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premise and conclusion and determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nThe premise states that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This means that if Tom did not watch football, then it is not necessarily the case that Jen did not watch basketball. Therefore, the premise is not a logical implication, and the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
