In this case, the conclusion is \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\" This conclusion is not necessarily true, as there is no logical connection between the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is a conditional statement that implies a causal relationship between the cake and the muffins. However, the conclusion \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry\" is a conditional statement that implies a causal relationship between the cake and the muffins, but the relationship is reversed.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid, as the conclusion does not follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: No",
