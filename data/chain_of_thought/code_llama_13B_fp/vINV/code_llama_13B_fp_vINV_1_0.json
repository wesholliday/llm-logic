            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it is a form of modus tollens, which is a valid logical inference. Modus tollens is a rule that states that if a conclusion follows from a premise, and the opposite of the conclusion follows from the opposite of the premise, then the premise is true.\n\nIn this case, the premise is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', and the conclusion is 'If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding'. The opposite of the conclusion is 'If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', which follows from the opposite of the premise 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding'. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
