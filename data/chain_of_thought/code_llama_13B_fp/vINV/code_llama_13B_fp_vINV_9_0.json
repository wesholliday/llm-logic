In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premise and conclusion and determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nThe premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This means that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nThe conclusion states that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This means that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premise, so the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
