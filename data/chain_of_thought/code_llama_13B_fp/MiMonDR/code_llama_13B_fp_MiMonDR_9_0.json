            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package might be delivered\" implies that there is a possibility of two outcomes: the package being delivered or not being delivered. However, it does not explicitly mention the possibility of the package being delayed. Delayed delivery is a specific scenario that falls under the broader category of not being delivered on time. Since the statement only mentions the possibility of delivery, it does not necessarily imply the possibility of delay. Therefore, we cannot infer that the package might be delayed or delivered from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
