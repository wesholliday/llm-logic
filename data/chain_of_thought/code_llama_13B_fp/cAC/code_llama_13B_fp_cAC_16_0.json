The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. This means that the conclusion is true even if the premise is false. In this case, the premise is \"The shirt was cotton,\" which is false, and the conclusion is \"The pants were denim,\" which is also false. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the shirt was cotton based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
