The first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. The second premise states that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nTo apply the rules of logic, we need to use the rules of inference. In this case, we can use the rule of modus ponens, which states that if we have a premise of the form \"if P, then Q\" and a premise of the form \"P\", then we can infer that Q.\n\nUsing the rule of modus ponens, we can infer that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. Since we know that Sue was at the wedding, we can infer that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
