The first premise states that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. The second premise states that Kate ate salad.\n\nTo apply the rules of logic, we need to use the rules of inference. In this case, we can use the rule of conditional proof, which states that if the antecedent (the if-part) of a conditional statement is true, and the consequent (the then-part) is also true, then we can conclude that the conditional statement is true.\n\nIn this case, the antecedent (Ben ate pasta) is true, and the consequent (Kate ate salad) is also true. Therefore, we can conclude that the conditional statement (if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad) is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
