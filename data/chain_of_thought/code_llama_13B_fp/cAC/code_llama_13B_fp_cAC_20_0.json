The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. This means that the statement is true only if the consequent (the banana was yellow) is also true, but it does not necessarily follow that the antecedent (the apple was red) is also true.\n\nIn other words, the statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is not a valid argument because it does not provide any evidence or reasoning to support the conclusion that the apple was red.\n\nAnswer: No",
