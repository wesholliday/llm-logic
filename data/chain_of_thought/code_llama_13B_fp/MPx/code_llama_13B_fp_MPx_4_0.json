It states that if the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked. This means that if the fribble was snurgled, then it is also true that the fribble crinked.\n\nThe second statement, 'The fribble was snurgled', is a simple statement that states that the fribble was snurgled.\n\nNow, we need to consider the logical relationship between these two statements. If the fribble was snurgled, then it is also true that the fribble crinked. Therefore, if we know that the fribble was snurgled, we can infer that the fribble crinked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
