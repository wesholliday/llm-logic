In this case, the antecedent is 'The smonk was vreebled'.\n\n'The smonk was vreebled' is a statement that is true by definition. It is a fact that the smonk was vreebled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The smonk plagged' is also true, because the conditional statement 'If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged' is true when the antecedent is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
