This implies that if the shank was not plooked, then it must not have been nugged.\n\nThe second statement, \"The shank might not have been nugged,\" suggests that the shank might not have been nugged, but it does not necessarily imply that the shank was not plooked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The shank was not plooked\" from the given information. The shank might have been plooked, but it might not have been nugged.\n\nAnswer: No",
