The twonk might not have been varnished.\n\nTo infer that the twonk was not plinked, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion.\n\nPremise 1 states that if the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished. This means that if the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished, regardless of whether it was plinked or not.\n\nPremise 2 states that the twonk might not have been varnished. This means that the twonk might not have been varnished, regardless of whether it was plinked or not.\n\nThe conclusion we want to draw is that the twonk was not plinked. To do this, we need to analyze the premises and see if they provide any information that contradicts the conclusion.\n\nIn this case, the premises do not provide any information that contradicts the conclusion. The first premise only states that if the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished, which does not necessarily mean that the twonk was not plinked. The second premise only states that the twonk might not have been varnished, which does not necessarily mean that the twonk was not plinked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the twonk was not plinked from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
