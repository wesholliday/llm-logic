The statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked\" is not logically equivalent to \"The splat might not have quanked.\" The first statement implies that if the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked, but the second statement does not imply that the splat was not morphed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The splat was not morphed\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
