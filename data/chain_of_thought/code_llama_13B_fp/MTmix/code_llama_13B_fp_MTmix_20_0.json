It might not have been surned.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'The fleeg was not bluttered' from these premises, we need to analyze the logical relationships between them.\n\nThe first premise states that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned. This means that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it is necessarily the case that it was surned.\n\nThe second premise states that it might not have been surned. This means that it is possible that the fleeg was not surned, even if it was bluttered.\n\nNow, we need to consider whether the first premise and the second premise are logically compatible. If they are not compatible, then we cannot infer 'The fleeg was not bluttered' from them.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the first premise and the second premise are logically compatible, then we can infer 'The fleeg was not bluttered' from them. This is because if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned, and if it was not surned, then it was not bluttered. Therefore, if we assume that the first premise and the second premise are logically compatible, then we can infer 'The fleeg was not bluttered' from them.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
