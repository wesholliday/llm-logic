The statement \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged\" is a logical fallacy, as it is not a valid argument. The statement \"The glip might not have tragged\" does not provide any information about whether the glip was slogged or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that the glip was not slogged.\n\nAnswer: no",
