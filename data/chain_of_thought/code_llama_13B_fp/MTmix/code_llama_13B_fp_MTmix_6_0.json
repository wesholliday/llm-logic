The grommet might not have plopped the frink.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the grommet was not sploffed, we need to analyze the logical relationships between the statements.\n\nThe first statement implies that if the grommet was sploffed, then it must have plopped the frink. This means that if the grommet was not sploffed, then it must not have plopped the frink.\n\nThe second statement states that the grommet might not have plopped the frink. This means that there is a possibility that the grommet did not plop the frink, even if it was sploffed.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we cannot infer that the grommet was not sploffed from the given statements. The statements do not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No",
