This implies that if the flob was not skizzled, it did not move.\n\nThe second statement, \"The flob might not have movated,\" suggests that the flob did not move. This is consistent with the first statement, as if the flob was not skizzled, it did not move.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The flob was not skizzled\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
