The phrase 'might be wozzled and crunked' suggests that the froodle has two possible states: being wozzled and being crunked. The use of 'and' indicates that these are two separate conditions that can occur independently of each other. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the froodle might be crunked, as it is one of the two possible states mentioned.\n\nAnswer: yes"
