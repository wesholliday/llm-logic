The original statement is 'The grooble must be on the quazzle'. This statement implies a specific location for the grooble, which is on the quazzle. However, it does not provide any information about the quimble. There is no logical connection made between the grooble and the quimble in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that the grooble must be in the quimble based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
