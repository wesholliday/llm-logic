            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The wibble must be zizz' is a categorical statement that implies a necessary condition. It suggests that for something to be a wibble, it must also be a zizz. However, this does not necessarily mean that a wibble cannot be a wobble. The original statement does not provide any information about wobbles, only about the relationship between wibbles and zizz. Therefore, we cannot infer that a wibble must be a wobble or a zizz, only that it must be a zizz.\n\nAnswer: no"
