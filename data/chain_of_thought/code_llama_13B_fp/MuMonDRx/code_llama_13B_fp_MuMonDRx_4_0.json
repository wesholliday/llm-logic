The word \"or\" is a logical operator that indicates a choice between two alternatives. In this case, the word \"or\" is used to connect the words \"quimble\" and \"blimple\". This suggests that the speaker is presenting two possible options for what the grazzle must do at zibber fizzle. Therefore, we can infer that the original sentence implies that the grazzle must either quimble or blimple at zibber fizzle.\n\nAnswer: yes"
