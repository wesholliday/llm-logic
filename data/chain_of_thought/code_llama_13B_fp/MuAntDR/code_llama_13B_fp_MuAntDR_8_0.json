The conclusion, however, is a conjunction, stating that the restaurant must have been open for limited hours. This is a logical error because the original statement does not rule out the possibility that the restaurant was closed on Monday. It only states that one of the two possibilities is true, but it does not provide enough information to conclude that the other possibility is also true.\n\nAnswer: no"
