            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical inference problem. The statement \"The document must have been signed or notarized\" is a disjunction, which means it is a statement that is true if at least one of the two conditions (being signed or notarized) is met. The word \"or\" is used to indicate that either condition is sufficient to make the statement true. Therefore, if the document was signed, the statement is still true, even if it was not notarized. This means that we cannot infer that the document must have been notarized, because the statement does not require both conditions to be met.\n\nAnswer: no"
