However, the conclusion \"The exam must have been easy\" is a specific instance of one of those possibilities, and it doesn't logically follow from the original statement. We can't conclude that the exam was easy just because it must have been either difficult or easy. We need more information to determine which of the two possibilities is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
