The word \"or\" is a key indicator of a disjunction. In a disjunction, both possibilities are not mutually exclusive, meaning they can both be true at the same time. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that both \"the wump might blimp zump\" and \"the wump might blimp wibble\" can be true simultaneously.\n\nAnswer: yes"
