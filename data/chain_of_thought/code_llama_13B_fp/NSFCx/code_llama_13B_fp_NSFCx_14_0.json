This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two possibilities must be true. However, it does not imply that both possibilities are true. In other words, it does not necessarily mean that the quorple might both fizzle and bimboozle. It's possible that the quorple might fizzle, or it might bimboozle, but not necessarily both.\n\nAnswer: no"
