The original statement only mentions that the application must have been completed online, which does not necessarily imply that references are included. It's possible that the online application process only involves submitting basic information, and references are handled separately or through a different channel. Without further context or information, we cannot assume that references are included in the online application.\n\nAnswer: no"
