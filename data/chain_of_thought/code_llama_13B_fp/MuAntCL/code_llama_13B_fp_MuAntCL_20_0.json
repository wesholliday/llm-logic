            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The event must have been formal\" provides information about the nature of the event, indicating that it was formal in character. However, it does not provide any information about whether the event required tickets. The requirement for tickets is a separate aspect of the event, and the fact that the event was formal does not necessarily imply that it was ticketed. Therefore, we cannot infer that the event must have been formal and required tickets based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
