To do this, we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe given statement is 'The report must have been accurate'. This statement only provides information about the report's content, specifically that it must have been accurate. It does not provide any information about when the report was submitted.\n\nThe new statement we are asked to infer is 'The report must have been accurate and been submitted by noon'. This statement includes two conditions: the report must have been accurate, and it must have been submitted by noon.\n\nSince the given statement only provides information about the report's accuracy, we cannot infer the second condition (submission by noon) from it. The two statements are not logically connected in a way that would allow us to infer the new statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
