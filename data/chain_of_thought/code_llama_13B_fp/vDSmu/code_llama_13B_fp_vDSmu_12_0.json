The first premise is a conditional statement, \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet,\" which is a logical implication. The second premise is a negation of the conclusion, \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet,\" which is also a logical implication. The conclusion is the negation of the first premise, \"The jacket is draped over the chair,\" which is also a logical implication.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it is a valid argument from a conditional premise to a conclusion.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
