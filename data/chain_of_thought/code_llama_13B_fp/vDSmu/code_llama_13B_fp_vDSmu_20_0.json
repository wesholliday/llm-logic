The first premise is a conditional statement, \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head,\" which is a logical implication. The second premise is a negation of the conclusion, \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head,\" which is also a logical implication. The conclusion is a conditional statement, \"The sunglasses are in her bag,\" which is a logical implication of the first two premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
