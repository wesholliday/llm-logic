The first premise is a conditional statement, \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk,\" which is a disjunctive syllogism. The second premise is a negation of the conclusion, \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk,\" which is also a conditional statement. The conclusion is the negation of the second premise, \"The pen is in my bag,\" which is also a conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
