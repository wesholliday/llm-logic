The first premise is a conditional statement, \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry,\" which is a disjunction of two statements. The second premise is a negation of the second statement in the first premise, \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\" The conclusion is the first statement in the first premise, \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\nThe argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises. The argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
