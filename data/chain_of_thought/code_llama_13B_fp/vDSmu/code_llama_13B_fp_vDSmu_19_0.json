The first premise states that the watch must be either charging on the dresser or on his wrist, and the second premise states that the watch is not on his wrist. This creates a contradiction, as the first premise implies that the watch must be on the dresser, but the second premise states that it is not on his wrist. Therefore, the conclusion that the watch is charging on the dresser must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
