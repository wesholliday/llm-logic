The first premise is a conditional statement, \"Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet,\" which is a disjunction of two mutually exclusive statements. The second premise is a negation of the second disjunct, \"It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet,\" which is a negation of a conditional statement. The conclusion is the first disjunct, \"The umbrella is in the car,\" which is a statement that is logically consistent with the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
