The first premise is a conditional statement, \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge,\" which is a disjunction of two mutually exclusive possibilities. The second premise is a negation of the second possibility, \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge,\" which is a negation of the second premise. The conclusion is the first possibility, \"The milk is on the counter,\" which is the only remaining possibility.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
