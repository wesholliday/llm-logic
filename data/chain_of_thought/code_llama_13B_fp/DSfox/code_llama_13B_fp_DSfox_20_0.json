This means that we can infer 'The fleeg is bluttered' from these two statements if we assume that the fleeg is not surned and either the fleeg is surned or it is bluttered.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer 'The fleeg is bluttered' from 'The fleeg is not surned' alone, as this statement does not provide enough information to determine whether the fleeg is bluttered or not. Therefore, the answer is 'no'.\n\nAnswer: no",
