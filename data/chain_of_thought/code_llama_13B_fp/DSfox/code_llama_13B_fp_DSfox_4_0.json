The second statement, 'Either the fribble is crinked or it is snurgled', implies that the fribble is either in a crinkled state or in a snurgled state.\n\nIf we assume that the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled. Therefore, we can infer that 'The fribble is snurgled' from 'The fribble is not crinked' together with 'Either the fribble is crinked or it is snurgled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
