This means that we can create a new statement that is the logical combination of these two statements:\n\n'The wug is not bimmed or the wug is flooped'\n\nThis new statement is a logical consequence of the original two statements. However, it does not necessarily follow that 'The wug is flooped' is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The wug is flooped' from 'The wug is not bimmed' together with 'Either the wug is bimmed or it is flooped'.\n\nAnswer: no",
