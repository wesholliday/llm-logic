Either the smonk is plagged or it is vreebled.\n\nTo infer that the smonk is vreebled, we need to use the information in a logical way. We can do this by using the principle of excluded middle, which states that for any proposition, either it is true or it is false.\n\nUsing this principle, we can say that either the smonk is plagged or it is not plagged. If it is not plagged, then it must be vreebled, since the second statement states that either the smonk is plagged or it is vreebled. Therefore, we can infer that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
