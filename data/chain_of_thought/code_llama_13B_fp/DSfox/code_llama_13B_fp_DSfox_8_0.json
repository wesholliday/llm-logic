Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked.\n\nTo infer that the sprocket is cranked, we need to use the law of excluded middle, which states that for any proposition, either it is true or it is false. In this case, we can infer that the sprocket is cranked if we assume that the sprocket is not daggled, and then use the law of excluded middle to conclude that the sprocket must be cranked.\n\nHowever, the law of excluded middle is not always valid, and it is important to consider the context and the assumptions made in the reasoning. In this case, we are given the premises that the sprocket is not daggled and either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked. If we assume that the sprocket is not daggled, and then use the law of excluded middle to conclude that the sprocket must be cranked, we are making an unwarranted assumption that the sprocket is not daggled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the sprocket is cranked from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
