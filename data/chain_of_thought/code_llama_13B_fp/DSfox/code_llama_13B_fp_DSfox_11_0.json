This means that we can infer 'The flug is blummed' from these two statements if we assume that the flug is not zimmed and that either the flug is zimmed or it is blummed.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer 'The flug is blummed' from 'The flug is not zimmed' alone, because this statement does not provide enough information to determine whether the flug is blummed or not.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'no'.",
