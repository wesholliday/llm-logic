Either the shank is nugged or it is plooked.\n\nTo infer that the shank is plooked, we need to use a logical deduction. We can do this by using the law of excluded middle, which states that for any proposition, either it is true or it is false.\n\nUsing this law, we can deduce that either the shank is nugged or it is not nugged. If the shank is not nugged, then it must be plooked, since it is not nugged and it is either nugged or plooked. Therefore, we can infer that the shank is plooked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
