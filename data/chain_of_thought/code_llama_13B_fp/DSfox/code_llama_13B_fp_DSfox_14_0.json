Either the clug is snugged or it is fleeked.\n\nTo infer that the clug is fleeked, we need to use the given information to reach a conclusion.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possibility that the clug is snugged. If the clug is snugged, then it is not fleeked, because the statement 'Either the clug is snugged or it is fleeked' explicitly states that if the clug is snugged, it is not fleeked.\n\nTherefore, if we assume that the clug is snugged, we can conclude that the statement 'The clug is not snugged' is false. This means that the clug is actually snugged, which contradicts the original statement that the clug is not snugged.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the clug is not snugged, and therefore it must be fleeked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
