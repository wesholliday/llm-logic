Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed.\n\nTo infer that the splat is morphed, we need to use the information in statement 1 to contradict the information in statement 2.\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the splat is not quanked, which means that it is not in a quanked state.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that either the splat is quanked or it is morphed. This means that if the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
