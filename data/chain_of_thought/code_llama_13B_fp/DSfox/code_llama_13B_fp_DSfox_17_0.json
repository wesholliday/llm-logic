Either the flob is movated or it is skizzled.\n\nTo infer that the flob is skizzled, we need to use the information in statement 2. This statement is a logical disjunction, which means that it is true if either of the two statements on either side of the 'or' is true.\n\nIn this case, the two statements are:\n\n1. The flob is movated.\n2. The flob is skizzled.\n\nIf we assume that the flob is not movated (as stated in statement 1), then we can conclude that the flob is skizzled (as stated in statement 2). Therefore, we can infer that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
