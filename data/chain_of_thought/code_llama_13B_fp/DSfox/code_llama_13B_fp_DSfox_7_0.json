Either the whiffle is tinked or it is shanked.\n\nTo infer that the whiffle is shanked, we need to use the information in statement 2. This statement is a logical disjunction, which means that it is true if either of the two statements on either side of the 'or' is true.\n\nIn this case, the two statements are:\n\n1. The whiffle is tinked.\n2. The whiffle is shanked.\n\nIf we assume that the whiffle is not tinked (as stated in statement 1), then we can conclude that the whiffle is shanked (as stated in statement 2). Therefore, we can infer that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
