Either the flugel is zargled or it is blimmed.\n\nTo infer that the flugel is blimmed, we need to apply the principle of excluded middle, which states that for any proposition, either it is true or it is false. In this case, we can infer that the flugel is either zargled or blimmed, but not both.\n\nSince we are given that the flugel is not zargled, we can conclude that it must be blimmed. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: yes",
