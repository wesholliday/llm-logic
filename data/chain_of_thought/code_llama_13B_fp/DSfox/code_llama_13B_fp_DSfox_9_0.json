The first statement, \"The twonk is not plinked,\" implies that the twonk is not plinked, while the second statement, \"Either the twonk is plinked or it is varnished,\" implies that the twonk is either plinked or varnished. Since the first statement contradicts the second statement, we cannot infer that the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: no",
