The second statement, \"Either the grommet is plopped or it is sploffed,\" implies that the grommet is either in a plopped state or in a sploffed state. However, the first statement and the second statement are contradictory, as they cannot both be true at the same time.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the grommet is sploffed from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
