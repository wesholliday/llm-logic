However, the statement \"If the match is struck and it has been soaked in water, then it will light\" is a specific case of the generalization, and it is not necessarily true.\n\nIn order to determine whether the specific statement is true or not, we need to consider the specific conditions under which the match is struck and soaked in water. If the match is struck and soaked in water, it may not light due to the water absorbing the oxygen and causing the match to burn more slowly or not at all. Therefore, the specific statement \"If the match is struck and it has been soaked in water, then it will light\" is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: No",
