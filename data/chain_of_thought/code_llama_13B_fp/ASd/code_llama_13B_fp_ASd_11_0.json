However, it does not necessarily imply that doing hard labor will also help to reduce fatigue.\n\nThere are several reasons why this might be the case. Firstly, getting enough sleep is not the only factor that determines whether someone is tired or not. Other factors, such as physical activity, diet, and overall health, can also play a role. Additionally, doing hard labor can be physically demanding and may require a significant amount of energy, which could lead to fatigue even if the person is well-rested.\n\nTherefore, while the statement \"If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired\" may be true in some cases, it does not necessarily imply that doing hard labor will also help to reduce fatigue.\n\nAnswer: No",
