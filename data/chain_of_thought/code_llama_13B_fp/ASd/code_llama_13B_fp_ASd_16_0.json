However, it does not necessarily imply that the lawn will be lush and green even if there is a drought.\n\nIn order to infer that \"If I fertilize the lawn and there is a drought, it will be lush and green,\" we would need more information about the relationship between fertilizing the lawn and the presence of a drought. For example, if the fertilizer used on the lawn is specifically designed to help the grass survive in drought conditions, then it is possible that fertilizing the lawn in a drought would result in a lush and green appearance. However, if the fertilizer is not designed for drought conditions, then it is possible that the lawn may not be as lush and green even if there is a drought.\n\nAnswer: No",
