However, it does not necessarily imply that the speaker is wearing earplugs, as the statement only mentions the speaker's ears.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If you scream and I am wearing earplugs, it will hurt my ears\" from the original statement. The additional information about earplugs is not present in the original statement, and we cannot assume that the speaker is wearing earplugs based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No",
