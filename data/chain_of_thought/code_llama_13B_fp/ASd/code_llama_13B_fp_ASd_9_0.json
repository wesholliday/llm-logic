However, the statement \"If the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A\" is not necessarily true.\n\nThe reason for this is that the fact that the essay is well-written does not necessarily mean that it will be graded more favorably if it is turned in late. The instructor may still give the student a lower grade if the essay is not well-written or if the student does not meet the requirements of the assignment.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
