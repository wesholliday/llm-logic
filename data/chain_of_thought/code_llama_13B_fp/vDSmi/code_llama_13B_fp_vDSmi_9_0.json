The conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that the missing puzzle piece is either in the box or it must be blending in on the floor. This means that if the missing puzzle piece is not in the box, it must be blending in on the floor.\n\nThe second premise states that the missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor. This means that if the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor, it must be in the box.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises. The missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
