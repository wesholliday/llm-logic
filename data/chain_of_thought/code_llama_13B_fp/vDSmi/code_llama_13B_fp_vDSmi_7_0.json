The first premise states that the umbrella is either in the car or tucked away in the closet. The second premise states that the umbrella is not tucked away in the closet. The conclusion states that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises. The conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises, and it is not possible for the conclusion to be false while the premises are true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
