The first premise states that either the scarf is stuffed in the backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack. The second premise states that the scarf might not be draped on the coat rack. The conclusion states that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises. The conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises, and it is not possible for the conclusion to be false while the premises are true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
