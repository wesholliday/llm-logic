The first premise is a conditional statement, \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table,\" which means that if the book is not on the shelf, then it must be resting on the table. The second premise is a negation of the second part of the first premise, \"The book might not be resting on the table,\" which means that the book is not resting on the table. The conclusion is the first part of the first premise, \"The book is on the shelf,\" which follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
