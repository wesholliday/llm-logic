The second premise states that the pen is not on my desk. The conclusion states that the pen is in my bag.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises. The conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises, and it is not possible for the conclusion to be false while the premises are true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
