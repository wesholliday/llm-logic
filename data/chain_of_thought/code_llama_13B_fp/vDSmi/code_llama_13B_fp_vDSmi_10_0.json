The first premise states that the missing sock is either in the laundry basket or under the bed. The second premise states that the missing sock is not under the bed. The conclusion states that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it follows the rules of logic. The first premise is a disjunction, which means that it is a statement that is either true or false. The second premise is a negation, which means that it is a statement that is either true or false. The conclusion is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that is either true or false.\n\nThe argument is also logically valid because it is a valid argument from disjunction. The first premise is a disjunction, which means that it is a statement that is either true or false. The second premise is a negation, which means that it is a statement that is either true or false. The conclusion is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that is either true or false.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
