The first premise states that either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry. The second premise states that the cookies might not be hidden in the pantry. The conclusion states that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it is possible for the cookies to be in the jar and not hidden in the pantry. If the cookies are in the jar, then they must be in the jar and not hidden in the pantry. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
