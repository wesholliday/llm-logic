The first premise is a conditional statement, \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the shelf,\" which is a logical implication. The second premise is a negation, \"The toy might not be sitting on the shelf,\" which is also a logical implication. The conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises, \"The toy is in the toy box.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
