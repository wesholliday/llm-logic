The first premise states that the watch is either charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist. The second premise states that the watch might not be on his wrist. The conclusion states that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises. The conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises, and it is not possible for the conclusion to be false while the premises are true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
