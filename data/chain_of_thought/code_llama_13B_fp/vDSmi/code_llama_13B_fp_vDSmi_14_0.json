The first premise is a conditional statement, \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge,\" which is a logical implication. The second premise is a negation of the conclusion, \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge,\" which is also a logical implication. The conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises, \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
