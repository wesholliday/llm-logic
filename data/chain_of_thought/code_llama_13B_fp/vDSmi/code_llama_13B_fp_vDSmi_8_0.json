The excluded middle states that for any proposition, either the proposition is true or the negation of the proposition is true. In this case, the excluded middle is being applied to the proposition \"the remote control is on the coffee table\" and its negation \"the remote control is not on the coffee table\".\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it is a valid form of argument from excluded middle. The argument is structured as follows:\n\n1. Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch (premise 1)\n2. The remote control might not be hiding under the couch (premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the remote control is on the coffee table (conclusion)\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises because the excluded middle is being applied to the proposition \"the remote control is on the coffee table\" and its negation \"the remote control is not on the coffee table\". The conclusion is logically valid because it is a valid form of argument from excluded middle.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
