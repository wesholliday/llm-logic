The first premise is a conditional statement, \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden,\" which can be logically equivalent to \"If Fido is not inside, then Fido must be in the garden.\" The second premise is a negation of the first premise, \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" which can be logically equivalent to \"If Fido is not in the garden, then Fido is inside.\" The conclusion is a logical consequence of the first two premises, \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
