The first premise states that either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet. The second premise states that the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet. The conclusion states that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it is possible for the keys to be in the drawer and not dangling in the cabinet. If the keys are in the drawer, then they must be in the drawer and not dangling in the cabinet. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
