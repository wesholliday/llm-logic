The first sentence states that the shank was not nugged, and the second sentence states that if the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\n\nFrom this information, we can conclude that the shank was not plooked. This is because the second sentence only applies if the shank was plooked, and since we know that the shank was not nugged, it must mean that the shank was not plooked.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'yes'.",
