If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\n\nTo infer that the sneg was not crampled, we need to analyze the given statements and their logical relationships.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first statement: \"The sneg did not sproted the frink.\" This statement is a negative statement, which means that the sneg did not produce the frink.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement: \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\" This statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the sneg was crampled, then it would produce the frink.\n\nThe key to understanding the logical relationship between these two statements is to recognize that the second statement is a contrapositive of the first statement. In other words, the second statement is the opposite of the first statement, but with the same logical structure.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sneg was not crampled by using the contrapositive of the second statement, which is: \"If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
