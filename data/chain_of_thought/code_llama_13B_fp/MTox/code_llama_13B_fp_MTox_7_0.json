If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\n\nTo infer that the whiffle was not shanked, we need to use the law of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot both be true and false at the same time.\n\nIn this case, the first premise states that the whiffle did not tink, which means that the statement \"the whiffle tinked\" is false. However, the second premise states that if the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked, which means that the statement \"the whiffle tinked\" is true.\n\nSince we cannot have both statements true at the same time, we can conclude that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
