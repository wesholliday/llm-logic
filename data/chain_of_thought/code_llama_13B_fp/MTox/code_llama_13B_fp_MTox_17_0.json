The statement \"The flob did not movated\" is a contradiction, as it implies that the flob did not move, but the statement \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated\" implies that the flob did move. Therefore, we cannot infer that the flob was not skizzled from these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
