If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\n\nTo infer that the zinger was not fraggled, we need to use the information in the given statements.\n\nFirst, we can see that the first statement says that the zinger was not smoogled. This means that the zinger was not in a state of smoogling.\n\nNext, we can see that the second statement says that if the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled. This means that if the zinger was in a state of fraggling, then it would be in a state of smoogling.\n\nNow, we can use the information in the first statement and the second statement to infer that the zinger was not fraggled. If the zinger was fraggled, then it would be in a state of smoogling, which is not the case according to the first statement. Therefore, we can conclude that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
