'Plagged' means to steal or take something that belongs to someone else, while 'vreebled' means to make something move or change in a strange or unexpected way.\n\nNext, we need to analyze the given information. 'The smonk did not plagged' means that the smonk did not steal or take something that belonged to someone else. 'If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged' means that if the smonk was made to move or change in a strange or unexpected way, then it would steal or take something that belonged to someone else.\n\nNow, we can see that the given information does not provide enough information to determine whether the smonk was vreebled or not. If the smonk was vreebled, then it would plagged, but if the smonk was not vreebled, then it would not plagged. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The smonk was not vreebled' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
