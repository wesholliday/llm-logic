The statement \"The flugel was not zargled\" is not logically consistent with the statement \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\" This is because the two statements are contradictory. If the flugel was blimmed, then it was not zargled, by definition. Therefore, we cannot infer that the flugel was not blimmed from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
