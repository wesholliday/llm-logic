            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer 'The dreb was not vroombed', we need to use the information provided in the two sentences. The first sentence states that the dreb was not spened, which means that it was not sprayed. The second sentence states that if the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened. This means that if the dreb was vroombed, it would have been sprayed.\n\nSince we know that the dreb was not spened, we can conclude that it was not vroombed. Therefore, the answer is 'yes'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
