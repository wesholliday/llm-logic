The second statement, 'If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed', means that if the flug was in a blummed state, then it would be in a zimmed state.\n\nNow, we need to consider the logical relationship between these two statements. If the flug was not zimmed, then it must not have been blummed, because if it was blummed, it would have been zimmed. Therefore, we can infer that 'The flug was not blummed' from 'The flug was not zimmed' together with 'If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
