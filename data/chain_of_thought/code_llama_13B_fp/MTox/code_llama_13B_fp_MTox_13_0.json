If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\n\nTo infer that the glip was not slogged, we need to apply the rules of logic. Specifically, we need to use the rule of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time.\n\nIn this case, the first premise states that the glip was not tragged, which means that it was not true that the glip was tragged. The second premise states that if the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged. However, this premise is not true, as the glip was not slogged. Therefore, we can conclude that the glip was not slogged.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
