If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\n\nTo infer that the twonk was not plinked, we need to analyze the given information and the logical relationships between them.\n\nFirst, we can see that the second statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true. In this case, the antecedent is \"the twonk was plinked.\"\n\nSecond, we can see that the first statement is a negative statement, which means that it is only true if the twonk was not plinked.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the twonk was not plinked, because the second statement is a conditional statement that only applies if the twonk was plinked, and the first statement is a negative statement that only applies if the twonk was not plinked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
