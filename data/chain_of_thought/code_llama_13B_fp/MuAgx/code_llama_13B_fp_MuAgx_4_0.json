            "content": "Explanation: The original statement contains a phrase \"in the wibble plonk\" which is a prepositional phrase modifying the noun \"snork gribble\". This suggests that \"in the wibble plonk\" is describing a location within \"snork gribble\", rather than a separate location. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that \"in the wibble plonk\" is an integral part of \"snork gribble\", and the quorple must be at both \"snork gribble\" and \"in the wibble plonk\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
