            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence contains the phrase \"it must zazzle a plimp flim\", which implies that the subject of the sentence (the gronk) is performing the action of zazzling a plimp flim. The word \"it\" is a pronoun that refers back to the subject of the sentence, which is the gronk.
