This clause is a separate thought or action that is not necessarily connected to the first part of the sentence. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The gribble must be flim on snork and blimple quazzle flim\" because the second part of the original sentence is not logically connected to the first part.\n\nAnswer: no"
