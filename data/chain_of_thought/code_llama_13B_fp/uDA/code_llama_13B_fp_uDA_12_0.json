Joe did not go to the park.\n\nTo infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo, we need to analyze the given information and determine whether it is logically consistent.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This statement implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement: \"Joe did not go to the park.\" This statement contradicts the first statement, as it implies that Joe did not go to the park, which means that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: yes",
