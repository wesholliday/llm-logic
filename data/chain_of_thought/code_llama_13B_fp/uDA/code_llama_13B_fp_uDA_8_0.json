However, we are not given any information about the mummy's current state of awake or asleep.\n\nNext, let's consider the second statement: \"The vampire was not awake.\" This statement tells us that the vampire is currently asleep. However, this does not necessarily mean that the mummy is also asleep.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information provided and determine whether it is possible to infer that the mummy was not awake based on the information provided. Since we are not given any information about the mummy's current state of awake or asleep, it is not possible to infer that the mummy was not awake based on the information provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the mummy was not awake based on the information provided.",
