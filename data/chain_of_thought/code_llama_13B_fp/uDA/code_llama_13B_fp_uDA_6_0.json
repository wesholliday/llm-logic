The question states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. It also states that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that Bob did not choose pasta. This is because the first statement implies that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. However, since Sue did not choose pizza, it follows that Bob did not choose pasta either.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes, we can infer that Bob did not choose pasta.",
