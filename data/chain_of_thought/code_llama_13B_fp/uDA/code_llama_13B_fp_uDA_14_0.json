The bear was in the cave and the wolf was in the den.\n2. The bear was in the cave and the wolf was not in the den.\n3. The bear was not in the cave and the wolf was in the den.\n4. The bear was not in the cave and the wolf was not in the den.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that the bear was not in the cave, so we can eliminate combinations 1 and 3. This leaves us with combinations 2 and 4.\n\nCombination 2 is the only one that is consistent with the given information, so we can infer that the wolf was not in the den.\n\nAnswer: yes",
