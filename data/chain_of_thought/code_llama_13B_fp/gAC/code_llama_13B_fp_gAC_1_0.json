            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether 'Mary was at the wedding' is true, we need to examine the premises and the conclusion. The first premise states that 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.' This means that if Mary was at the wedding, then it is also true that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nThe second premise states that 'Sue was at the wedding.' This means that Sue was indeed at the wedding.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether the conclusion 'Mary was at the wedding' follows from the premises. To do this, we need to examine the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe first premise tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This means that if Mary was not at the wedding, then it is not necessarily true that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nThe second premise tells us that Sue was at the wedding. This means that Sue was indeed at the wedding.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether the conclusion 'Mary was at the wedding' follows from the premises. To do this, we need to examine the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe first premise tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This means that if Mary was not at the wedding, then it is not necessarily true that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nThe second premise tells us that Sue was at the wedding. This means that Sue was indeed at the wedding.\n\nSince the first premise does not tell us anything about whether Mary was at the wedding, and the second premise tells us that Sue was at the wedding, it is not possible to determine whether the conclusion 'Mary was at the wedding' follows from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'no.'",
