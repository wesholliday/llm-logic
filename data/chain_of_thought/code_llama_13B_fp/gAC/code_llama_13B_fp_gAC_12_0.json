            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether 'Joe went to the park' is true, we need to evaluate the conditional statement 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo'. We know that 'Lucy went to the zoo' is true, so we need to see if the antecedent of the conditional statement is also true.\n\nIn this case, the antecedent is 'Joe went to the park'. We don't know whether this is true or not, so we need to look at the other information we have.\n\nWe are given that 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' is true. This means that if 'Joe went to the park' is true, then 'Lucy went to the zoo' is also true.\n\nSince we know that 'Lucy went to the zoo' is true, we can conclude that 'Joe went to the park' is also true. Therefore, the answer is 'yes'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
