The argument is an example of a conditional argument, which consists of a premise and a conclusion. The premise is 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel', and the conclusion is 'The book is a mystery novel'.\n\nThe conclusion follows from the premise if the premise is true and the conclusion is true. In this case, the premise is true because the book was written by James, and the conclusion is true because the book is a mystery novel. Therefore, the conclusion follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
