            "content": " To determine the logical validity of the given argument, we need to apply the rules of logic to its structure. The argument can be represented in symbolic form as follows:\n\nIf A, then B\nNot-B\nTherefore, Not-A\n\nThis is known as a simple conditional argument or modus ponens with the negation of the consequent (denying the hypothesis). To evaluate its validity, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Assume that both premises are true.\n2. Determine if the conclusion must be true based on the given premises and logical rules.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the argument:\n\nStep 1: Assume both premises are true.\n- Premise 1 (If A, then B) is assumed to be true.\n- Premise 2 (Not-B) is also assumed to be true.\n\nStep 2: Determine if the conclusion must be true based on the given premises and logical rules.\n- To do this, we need to apply the modus ponens rule, which states that if A implies B and not-B is false, then A must be false.\n- In our case, since Premise 1 (A implies B) and Premise 2 (Not-B) are given, we can check if Not-B is a logical consequence of A implies B and the truth of Premise 2.\n- If we assume that A is true, then by Premise 1, B must be true as well. However, since Premise 2 states that Not-B is true (i.e., B is false), this creates a contradiction.\n- Since a contradiction cannot be a logical consequence of true premises, the argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: no.",
