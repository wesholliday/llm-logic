            "content": " To determine the logical validity of an argument, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In this case, the argument is:\n\n1. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n2. The pants were not denim.\n3. Therefore, the shirt was not cotton.\n\nLet's analyze each step:\n\n1. This is a conditional statement (if-then statement). It sets up a relationship between two propositions: if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim.\n2. The second premise states that the pants are not denim.\n3. From these premises, we are asked to conclude that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, let's consider a possible scenario where both premises are true but the conclusion is false:\n\n1. The shirt is cotton.\n2. The pants are not denim (let's say they are wool).\n\nIn this scenario, both premises are true, but the conclusion is false. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no.",
