            "content": " To determine the logical validity of an argument, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from its premises. In this case, we have:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (P1)\n2. The mummy was not awake (P2)\n3. Therefore, the vampire was not awake (C)\n\nLet's analyze this argument step by step:\n\n1. We have two premises, P1 and P2.\n2. To test the validity of the argument, we need to see if C follows logically from P1 and P2.\n3. In order for C to follow logically, it must be the case that if both P1 and P2 are true, then C must be true as well.\n4. Let's assume that P1 and P2 are true. This means that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is awake, but the mummy is not awake.\n5. From this information, it does not follow logically that the vampire is not awake. In fact, we cannot determine anything about the vampire's wakefulness based on the given premises alone.\n6. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no.",
