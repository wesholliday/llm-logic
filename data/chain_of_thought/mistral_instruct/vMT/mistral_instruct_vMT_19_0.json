            "content": " To determine the logical validity of the given argument, we need to apply the rules of logic to its structure. The argument can be represented in symbolic form as follows:\n\n1. If Tom watches football (F), then Jen watches basketball (B) (premise 1)\n2. Jen does not watch basketball (~B) (premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Tom does not watch football (~F) (conclusion)\n\nThe argument is a form of modus ponens, which states that if we have two statements: A and \"If A then B,\" then the truth of A implies the truth of B. In this case, our given premises are the negation of B and the conditional statement \"If F then B.\"\n\nTo check for validity, we need to show that the conclusion follows logically from the premises. To do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Assume the truth of the premises (premise 1: If F then B and premise 2: ~B)\n2. Derive a contradiction from the assumptions (if possible)\n3. Since a contradiction has been derived, the premises cannot both be true, making the argument invalid\n4. If no contradiction can be derived, the argument is valid\n\nLet's apply these steps to our given argument:\n\n1. Assume the truth of premises 1 and 2 (If F then B and ~B)\n2. From premise 1, we have that if F then B. Since we are assuming the negation of B (~B), it follows that F cannot be true according to the given conditional statement.\n3. Therefore, no contradiction has been derived from our assumptions.\n4. Since no contradiction was derived, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
