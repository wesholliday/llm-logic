If p (bear in cave), then q (wolf in den) - First premise\n2. Not-q (wolf not in den) - Second premise\n3. Therefore, not-p (bear not in cave) - Conclusion\n\nThis argument is known as Modus Tollens and it is a valid form of logical argument if the premises are true. To check its validity, we need to ensure that the second premise negates the consequent of the first premise. In this case, that's exactly what has happened.\n\nSo, the answer is: Answer: yes.",
