            "content": " To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we can use the rules of propositional logic. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race (A \u2192 C)\n2. Chris did not finish the race (\u00acC)\n3. Therefore, Alex did not finish the race (\u00acA)\n\nThe negation of a statement implies that the original statement is false. So, \u00acC means that Chris did not finish the race, and \u00acA means that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nNow let's apply the rules of propositional logic to check if this argument is valid:\n\n1. We have two premises (A \u2192 C and \u00acC).\n2. To prove that the conclusion (\u00acA) follows logically from these premises, we need to show that if both premises are true, then the conclusion must be true as well.\n3. Using the rules of propositional logic, we can apply Modus Tollens to this argument: If A \u2192 C and \u00acC, then \u00acA.\n4. Therefore, since both premises (A \u2192 C and \u00acC) are given in the argument, and Modus Tollens tells us that \u00acA follows logically from these premises, we can conclude that the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
