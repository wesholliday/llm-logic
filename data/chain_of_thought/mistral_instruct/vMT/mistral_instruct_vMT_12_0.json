If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo (Premise 1)\n2. Lucy did not go to the zoo (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Joe did not go to the park (Conclusion)\n\nFirst, let's check if Premises 1 and 2 are consistent with each other. If we assume that both premises are true, then according to Premise 1, if Joe went to the park, Lucy would have gone to the zoo. However, Premise 2 states that Lucy did not go to the zoo. This creates a contradiction because we cannot have it that both Joe went to the park and Lucy did not go to the zoo at the same time, given Premises 1 and 2.\n\nSince the premises lead to a contradiction when assumed to be true, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no.",
