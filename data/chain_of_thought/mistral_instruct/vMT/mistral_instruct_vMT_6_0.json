Let's assign truth values to the propositions as follows:\n\np: If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\nq: Bob did not choose pasta\nr: Sue did not choose pizza\n\nWe will calculate the truth table for p, q, and r, and check if r follows logically from p and q.\n\n| p | q | r |\n|---|---|---|\n| T  | T  | T  |\n| T  | T  | F  |\n| T  | F  | T  |\n| T  | F  | F  |\n| F  | T  | T  |\n| F  | T  | F  |\n| F  | F  | T  |\n| F  | F  | T  |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that the conclusion 'r' follows logically from the premises 'p' and 'q' only in the case where both 'p' and 'q' are true. In all other cases, the conclusion does not follow logically from the premises. Therefore, the given argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no.",
