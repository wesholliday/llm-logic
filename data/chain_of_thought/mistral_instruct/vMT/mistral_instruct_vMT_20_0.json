            "content": " To determine the logical validity of an argument, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In this case, the argument is as follows:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n2. The banana was not yellow.\n3. Therefore, the apple was not red.\n\nLet's analyze each step:\n\nStep 1: Understanding the premises\nThe first premise is a conditional statement, which means it has an 'if-then' structure. In this case, the statement is saying that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow.\n\nStep 2: Analyzing the second premise\nThe second premise states that the banana was not yellow. This information alone does not directly affect the truth or falsity of the first premise. However, it does contradict the 'if' part of the first premise (the apple being red).\n\nStep 3: Evaluating the conclusion\nThe conclusion is that the apple was not red. Since the second premise contradicts the 'if' part of the first premise, and the conclusion is the negation of the 'if' part, it follows logically from the premises.\n\nTherefore, Answer: yes.",
