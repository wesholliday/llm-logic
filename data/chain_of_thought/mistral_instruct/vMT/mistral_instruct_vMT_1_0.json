If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (Premise 1)\n2. Sue was not at the wedding (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Mary was not at the wedding (Conclusion)\n\nFirst, let's check if Premises 1 and 2 are consistent with each other. If we assume that both premises are true, then according to Premise 1, if Mary is at the wedding, Sue must be there as well. However, Premise 2 states that Sue was not at the wedding. This creates a contradiction because we cannot have it that both Mary and Sue are at the wedding (as per Premise 1) and also that only Mary is present (as per Premise 2).\n\nSince the premises lead to a contradiction, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no.",
