            "content": " To determine the logical validity of the given argument, we need to apply the rules of logic to its premises and conclusion. Let's analyze each part step by step:\n\n1. If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train (Premise 1)\n2. Erin did not take a train (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Sam did not take a plane (Conclusion)\n\nFirst, let's examine the relationship between Premises 1 and 2:\n\n1. If P (Sam took a plane), then Q (Erin took a train)\n2. Not-Q (Erin did not take a train)\n\nSince Premise 1 states that \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train,\" this is an example of a conditional statement or an implication. In logic, the negation of the consequent (Erin not taking a train) does not necessarily mean that the hypothesis (Sam not taking a plane) must be true. This is known as the material implication and can be represented as:\n\nP \u2192 Q\nNot-Q \u2228 P\n\nTo prove the logical validity of the argument, we need to show that if both premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. In this case, since Premise 2 states \"Erin did not take a train,\" and given that Premise 1 implies that \"if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train,\" it follows that \"Sam did not take a plane\" (Premise 3 or the conclusion) must be true to maintain the consistency of the premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because if both premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
