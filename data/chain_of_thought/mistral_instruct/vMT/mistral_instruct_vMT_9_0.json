If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt (Premise 1)\n2. Mark did not buy the blue shirt (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Lisa did not buy the red shirt (Conclusion)\n\nFirst, let's check if Premises 1 and 2 are consistent with each other. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then according to Premise 1, Mark would have bought the blue shirt. However, Premise 2 states that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This creates a contradiction between the two premises.\n\nSince the argument contains a contradiction, it is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no.",
