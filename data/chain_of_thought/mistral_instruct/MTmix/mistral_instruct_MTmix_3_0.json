The second statement introduces a possibility that the splat might not have quanked.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not contradict the first statement directly. It only states that there's a possibility that the condition (morphed) does not lead to the consequence (quanking).\n\nStep 3: Consider all possible scenarios\n\nScenario A: The splat is morphed and quanks. This scenario satisfies both statements.\nScenario B: The splat is morphed but doesn't quank. This scenario contradicts statement 1 but does not directly contradict statement 2 since it introduces a possibility.\n\nStep 4: Determine if the given statements allow us to infer 'The splat was not morphed'\n\nNo, we cannot infer that 'The splat was not morphed' based on the given statements. The second statement only introduces a possibility that the splat might not have quanked, but it does not necessarily mean that the splat was not morphed. There could still be scenarios where the splat is morphed and doesn't quank (Scenario B).\n\nAnswer: no.",
