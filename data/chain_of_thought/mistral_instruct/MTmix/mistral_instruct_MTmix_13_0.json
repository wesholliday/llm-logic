However, Statement 2 introduces the possibility that the second event (tragging) might not have occurred even though the first event (slogging) did.\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of both statements together\n\nThe two statements seem to contradict each other because if slogging implies tragging, but tragging might not have happened, then it's possible that slogging didn't occur either. However, we cannot infer 'The glip was not slogged' directly from the given statements alone.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\n\nAnswer: No.",
