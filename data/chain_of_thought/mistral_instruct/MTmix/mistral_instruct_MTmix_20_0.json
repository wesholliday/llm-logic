This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first condition (bluttered) is true, then the second condition (surned) must also be true.\n\nStatement 2 states that it's possible for the fleeg not to have been surned even if it was bluttered. This means that the absence of being surned does not necessarily mean the absence of being bluttered.\n\nStep 3: Consider both statements together\n\nSince Statement 1 implies that if the fleeg is bluttered, then it must be surned, but Statement 2 states that it might not have been surned even when it was bluttered, we cannot infer that \"The fleeg was not bluttered\" based on these given statements. Instead, the statements are contradictory and do not allow us to make a definitive conclusion about the state of the fleeg regarding being bluttered or surned.\n\nAnswer: no.",
