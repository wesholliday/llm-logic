The second statement, however, suggests that the twonk might not have been varnished at all. These two statements are in conflict with each other because they cannot both be true simultaneously.\n\nStep 3: Determine if we can infer 'The twonk was not plinked' based on the given information\n\nSince we cannot determine for certain whether or not the twonk has been plinked (we only know that it might not have been varnished), we cannot infer 'The twonk was not plinked' with the given information.\n\nAnswer: no.",
