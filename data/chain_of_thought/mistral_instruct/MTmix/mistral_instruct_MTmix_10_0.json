However, the second statement introduces a possibility that the wug might not have been garpled even if it was sproinged. This creates a contradiction because the two statements cannot both be true at the same time.\n\nStep 3: Determine the valid conclusion based on the given information\n\nSince we cannot have a situation where a wug is sproinged but not garpled, and also a situation where a wug is sproinged and not garpled, it follows that the statements together do not allow us to infer that 'The wug was not sproinged'. Instead, they create a logical inconsistency.\n\nAnswer: No.",
