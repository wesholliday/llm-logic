(Possibility)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the statements\n\nThe given statements do not allow us to infer that 'The smonk was not vreebled'. Implication 1 states that if a smonk is vreebled, then it must have plagged. However, the second statement only suggests that the smonk might not have plagged, it does not necessarily mean that the smonk was not vreebled. Therefore, we cannot make such an assumption based on the given information alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
