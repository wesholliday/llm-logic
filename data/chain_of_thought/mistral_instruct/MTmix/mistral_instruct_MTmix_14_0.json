(Possible negation of the consequence)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the logical relationship between the statements\n\nThe given statements do not allow us to infer 'The clug was not fleeked'. Here's why:\n\n1. The first statement tells us that if a clug is fleeked, then it must have been snugged. This means that fleeking implies snugging.\n2. The second statement states that the clug might not have been snugged, which is a possible negation of the consequence (snugged) from the first statement. However, this does not necessarily mean that the clug was not fleeked. It only means that it might not have been snugged despite being fleeked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The clug was not fleeked' based on the given statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
