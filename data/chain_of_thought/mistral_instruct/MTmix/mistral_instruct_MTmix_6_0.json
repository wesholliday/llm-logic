However, Statement 2 introduces a possibility that the grommet might not have plopped the frink at all. This means that even if the grommet was sploffed (which would normally imply plopping the frink according to Statement 1), it is still possible for the grommet not to have done so.\n\nStep 3: Determine the answer based on the given information\n\nSince we cannot infer that 'The grommet was not sploffed' from the given statements, as there is a possibility that the grommet was indeed sploffed but did not plop the frink.\n\nAnswer: no.",
