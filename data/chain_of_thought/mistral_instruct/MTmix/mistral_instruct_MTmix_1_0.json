However, Statement 2 introduces a possibility that the zargling did not occur even though the blimming did.\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of both statements together\n\nThe if-then rule suggests that blimming implies zargling, but Statement 2 states that zargling is not necessarily a given when blimming occurs. This creates a contradiction between the two statements.\n\nStep 4: Determine if it's possible for both statements to be true at the same time\n\nGiven the information provided, it seems unlikely that both statements can be true simultaneously because they present conflicting information about the relationship between blimming and zargling.\n\nStep 5: Infer the negation of one statement based on the other (if possible)\n\nSince we cannot determine if both statements are true at once, let's try to infer the negation of one statement based on the other. If Statement 1 is false, then it must be that blimming does not always lead to zargling. In this case, 'The flugel was not blimmed' would be a possible explanation for why zargling did not occur.\n\nStep 6: Check if the inferred statement logically follows from the given information\n\nTo ensure that our inference is valid, let's consider whether 'The flugel was not blimmed' is a logical consequence of the given statements. If Statement 1 is false, then it means that blimming does not necessarily result in zargling. Therefore, there could be instances where the flugel is not blimmed at all, which would explain why zargling did not occur.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
