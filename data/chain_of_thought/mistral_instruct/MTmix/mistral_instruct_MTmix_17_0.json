The second statement introduces a possibility that the flob might not have moved at all.\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of both statements together\n\nThe first statement implies that if the flob was skizzled, it moved. The second statement introduces a possibility that the flob did not move despite being skizzled. This creates a contradiction because these two statements cannot both be true at the same time.\n\nStep 4: Determine the valid conclusion based on the given information\n\nSince the two statements create a logical contradiction, it is impossible to determine definitively whether 'The flob was not skizzled' based on the given information alone. However, we can infer that the given statements are inconsistent and cannot both be true.\n\nAnswer: No. (This answer indicates that we cannot infer 'The flob was not skizzled' from the given statements, but rather that the statements themselves are inconsistent.)",
