However, the second statement introduces a possibility that the sprocket might not be daggled even when it's cranked. This creates a contradiction as these two statements cannot both be true at the same time.\n\nStep 3: Determine if we can infer 'The sprocket was not cranked'\n\nSince the given statements create a logical contradiction, it means that neither statement can be definitively proven to be true based on the information provided. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The sprocket was not cranked'.\n\nAnswer: no.",
