We are also given that \"Either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside.\"\n3. Since we know that Fido is not in the garden, this means that the first part of the disjunction (i.e., \"Fido is in the garden\") must be false.\n4. Therefore, according to the truth table for disjunctions, the second part of the disjunction (i.e., \"Fido is inside\") must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
