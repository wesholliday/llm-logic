The first statement only tells us that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, while the second statement presents a disjunction (either-or proposition) between two possibilities: the cookies being in the pantry or the cookies being in the jar. However, the absence of the cookies from the pantry does not necessarily mean they are in the jar; it could also be possible that they are somewhere else entirely.",
