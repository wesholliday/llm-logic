This means that the pen could be somewhere else entirely. However, since we don't have any information about where else the pen could be, we can only infer that it is not on the desk and not in the bag based on what has been given.\n\nTherefore, we cannot directly infer 'The pen is in my bag', but we can infer that 'The pen is not on my desk' and 'The pen is not in my bag'.\n\nAnswer: no. (This answer assumes that the question asks if we can infer 'The pen is in my bag' based on the given information alone, without making any additional assumptions.)",
