From \"The toy isn't sitting on the shelf\" and \"Either the toy is sitting on the shelf or it is in the toy box,\" we cannot directly infer that \"The toy is in the toy box.\" The second statement only gives us two mutually exclusive possibilities, but it does not necessarily mean that if one possibility is not true, then the other must be. In this case, it's possible that the toy is somewhere else entirely, such as on the floor or in another room.",
