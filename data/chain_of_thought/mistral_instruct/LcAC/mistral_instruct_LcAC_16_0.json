            "content": " Answer: Yes. The first statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim' is a conditional statement. When the condition (shirt being cotton) is true, then the consequence (pants being denim) is also true. Given that we know the consequence (pants being denim), and the if-then statement states that when the condition is true, the consequence must be true, it logically follows that the condition must also be true (shirt being cotton).",
