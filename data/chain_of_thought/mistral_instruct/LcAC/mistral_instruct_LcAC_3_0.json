If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel (Premise 1)\n2. The book is a mystery novel (Premise 2)\n\nTo reach a conclusion, we need to determine if Premise 1 and Premise 2 together logically imply that \"The book was written by James.\" This can be determined using the rules of logic:\n\n1. If P implies Q, and Q is true, then P must also be true (Modus Ponens)\n\nApplying this rule to our given statements:\n\n1. Premise 1 states that \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\"\n2. Premise 2 states that \"The book is a mystery novel\"\n3. Since Premise 2 is true (the book is a mystery novel), and Premise 1 states that \"if\" the book being a mystery novel is true, then \"the book was written by James\" must also be true (according to Modus Ponens)\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
