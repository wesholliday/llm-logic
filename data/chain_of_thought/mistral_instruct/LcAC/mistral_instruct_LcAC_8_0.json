If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (conditional statement).\n2. The mummy was awake.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what a conditional statement is and how it works. A conditional statement consists of an \"if\" clause and a \"then\" clause. In this case, the \"if\" clause is \"the vampire was awake,\" and the \"then\" clause is \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\nGiven statement 2 tells us that the mummy was awake. However, it does not directly tell us whether or not the vampire was awake. To make a logical conclusion based on these statements, we need to consider both the conditional statement and the given fact together.\n\nTo apply this logic, let's ask ourselves: If the condition (vampire being awake) in the conditional statement is true, then what must also be true according to the statement? The answer is that the mummy would be awake as well. Since we know that the mummy was indeed awake based on given statement 2, it means that the condition in the conditional statement (vampire being awake) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can logically conclude that \"The vampire was awake.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
