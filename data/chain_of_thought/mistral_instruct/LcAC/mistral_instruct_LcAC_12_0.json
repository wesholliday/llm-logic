We have two conditional statements:\n   a) If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo (P \u2192 Q)\n   b) Lucy went to the zoo (Q)\n\n2. To determine if we can infer that P (Joe went to the park) is true based on Q (Lucy went to the zoo), we need to apply the rule of Modus Ponens:\n   If P \u2192 Q and Q are both true, then P must also be true.\n\n3. In our case, we have P \u2192 Q (If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo) and Q (Lucy went to the zoo). However, we don't have any direct evidence that P (Joe went to the park) is true.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the given information alone, we cannot logically conclude that \"Joe went to the park\" (Answer: no).\n\nIt's important to note that while we can't directly infer Joe went to the park from the given statements, there might be other pieces of information or context that could allow us to make that conclusion. But based on the provided statements alone, we cannot logically conclude it.",
