The truck was blue.\n\nStep 2: Analyze each statement independently.\n\nStatement 1 implies that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. It does not make any direct statement about the color of the car.\n\nStatement 2 states that the truck is blue.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possible implications of both statements together.\n\nThe second statement (truck being blue) satisfies the condition stated in the first statement (if car is red, then truck is blue). However, it does not necessarily mean that the car is red. The first statement only implies that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue; it doesn't guarantee that the car is red.\n\nStep 4: Conclude based on given information.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot logically conclude 'The car was red' based on the given statements.",
