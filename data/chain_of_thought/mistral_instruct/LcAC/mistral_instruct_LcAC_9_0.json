If p (Lisa bought the red shirt), then q (Mark bought the blue shirt).\n2. q (Mark bought the blue shirt) is a fact.\n\nTo find out if p (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, we need to test the given conditions for a valid implication:\n\n1. If p is true, then q must be true (since we know q is true).\n2. If not-p (Lisa did not buy the red shirt), then not-q cannot be true (since we know q is true).\n\nSince we have established that q is true and it follows that p must also be true, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes.",
