We have two conditional statements:\n   a) If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad (If p, then q)\n   b) Kate ate salad (q)\n\n2. To determine if we can infer that \"Ben ate pasta\" from these statements, we need to apply the rules of logical implication:\n\n   a) From 'p' implies 'q', and 'q', we cannot directly infer 'p'. However, we can conclude that 'p' or 'Ben ate pasta' is possible. This is because the given information only establishes a conditional relationship between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating salad, not an absolute one.\n\n3. Therefore, based on the given statements, we cannot logically conclude with certainty that \"Ben ate pasta.\" However, it is possible that he did eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: no, we cannot logically conclude that 'Ben ate pasta' with certainty based on the given statements alone. But, it is possible that he did eat pasta.",
