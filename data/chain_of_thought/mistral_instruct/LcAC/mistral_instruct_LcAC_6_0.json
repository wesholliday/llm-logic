We have two conditional statements:\n   a) If Sue chooses pizza, then Bob chooses pasta (Let's call this statement A).\n   b) Bob chooses pasta (Let's call this statement B).\n\n2. To determine if we can infer that \"Sue chose pizza\" from these two statements, we need to apply the rules of logical implication:\n\n   a) From statement A, we know that if Sue chooses pizza, then Bob chooses pasta. This is a conditional statement, and it does not necessarily mean that Sue always chooses pizza when Bob chooses pasta. It only means that whenever Sue chooses pizza, Bob chooses pasta.\n\n   b) Statement B tells us that Bob actually chose pasta. However, this doesn't directly give us any information about what Sue chose.\n\n3. To infer that \"Sue chose pizza\" from statements A and B, we would need to know that whenever Bob chooses pasta, Sue must have chosen pizza as well. But statement A only tells us that when Sue chooses pizza, Bob chooses pasta \u2013 it doesn't tell us that whenever Bob chooses pasta, Sue must have chosen pizza.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically conclude that \"Sue chose pizza.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
