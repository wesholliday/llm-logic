If p then q (p implies q)\n2. q\n\nThen we can infer p as follows:\n\nGiven: If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis (p implies q)\n      Amy played tennis (q)\n\nTo find p (Jeff played basketball), we need to ensure that the conditional statement (p implies q) is a valid implication. In other words, we must check if the occurrence of q (Amy playing tennis) guarantees that p (Jeff playing basketball) is true.\n\nHowever, from the given statements alone, we cannot definitively conclude that Jeff played basketball because there's no direct evidence or statement provided in the premises stating that Jeff did play basketball. Therefore, based on the available information, it would be an incorrect conclusion to make.\n\nAnswer: No.",
