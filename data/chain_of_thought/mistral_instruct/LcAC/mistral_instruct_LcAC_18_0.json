It states that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. This means that the two statements are related but not necessarily true for all cases.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the truck is metal. However, it does not provide any information about the doll being plastic or not.\n\nStep 3: Consider the logical conclusion\n\nTo logically conclude that 'The doll was plastic', we would need some additional information that confirms the first statement (if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal) is true for this specific case. Without such information, we cannot make that conclusion based on the given statements alone.\n\nStep 4: Write the answer\n\nAnswer: No.",
