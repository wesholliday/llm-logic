The muffins were blueberry.\n\nTo determine if we can logically conclude that \"The cake was chocolate,\" let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We know that the muffins are blueberry based on statement 2.\n2. Statement 1 tells us that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry.\n3. However, it does not state that if the muffins are blueberry, then the cake must be chocolate.\n4. Therefore, even though we know the muffins are blueberry, we cannot definitively conclude that the cake is chocolate based on the given information alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
