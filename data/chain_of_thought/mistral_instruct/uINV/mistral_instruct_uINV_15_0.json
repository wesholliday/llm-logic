This means that if event P occurs, then event Q must also occur. However, it does not necessarily mean that if event Q does not occur, then event P cannot occur.\n\nStep 3: Consider the reverse scenario\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train, we need to consider the reverse scenario. If Sam did not take a plane, it does not necessarily mean that Erin also did not take a train. The given statement only tells us that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. It does not provide any information about what happens when Sam does not take a plane.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\n\nAnswer: no.",
