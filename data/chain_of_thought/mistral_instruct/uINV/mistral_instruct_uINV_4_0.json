It means that if one event (alien visiting Mars) occurs, then another event (robot visiting Jupiter) also occurs.\n\nStep 2: The statement \"If the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter\" is another conditional statement with the opposite condition. It means that if the first event (alien not visiting Mars) occurs, then the second event (robot not visiting Jupiter) also occurs.\n\nStep 3: To determine if we can infer the second conditional statement from the first, we need to consider if the contrapositive of the first statement is true. The contrapositive of \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A\".\n\nStep 4: Let's check if the contrapositive of \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" is true:\n\n- If the alien did not visit Mars (not A), then the robot did not visit Jupiter (not B).\n\nStep 5: Since we don't have enough information to determine if this statement is true or false, we cannot infer that \"If the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter\" is always true based on the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
