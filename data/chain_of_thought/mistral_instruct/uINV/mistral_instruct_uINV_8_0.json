It does not provide enough information to make a definitive statement about the reverse relationship.\n\nStep 3: The given statement only tells us that if one event occurs, then the other event also occurs. It does not guarantee that if one event does not occur, then the other event will not occur.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, we cannot infer that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake, based on the given information alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
