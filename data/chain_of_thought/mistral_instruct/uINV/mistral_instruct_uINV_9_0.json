            "content": " Step 1: Understand the given information\n\nThe given information states that \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the conditional statement\n\nThis is a conditional statement of the form \"if p, then q.\" It means that if p (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then q (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true. However, it does not necessarily mean that if q (Mark buying the blue shirt) is false, then p (Lisa buying the red shirt) must also be false.\n\nStep 3: Consider the reverse implication\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that \"if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt,\" we need to consider the reverse implication of the original statement. That is, if q (Mark buying the blue shirt) is false, does it follow that p (Lisa buying the red shirt) must also be false?\n\nStep 4: Determine the answer\n\nNo, we cannot infer that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt. The original statement only tells us that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. It does not provide any information about what happens when Lisa does not buy the red shirt.
