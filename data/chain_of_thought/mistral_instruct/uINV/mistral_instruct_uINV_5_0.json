However, the converse is not necessarily true - if Q (Amy plays tennis) is true, it does not automatically mean that P (Jeff plays basketball) is true.\n\nStep 3: Consider the negation of the given statement.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis, we need to consider the negation of the given statement: \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\"\n\nStep 4: Analyze the negated conditional statement.\n\nThe negated conditional statement is also in the form \"If P, then Q,\" but with the opposite conditions (not-P and not-Q). This means that if the condition not-P (Jeff did not play basketball) is true, then the consequence not-Q (Amy did not play tennis) must also be true for the negated statement to hold.\n\nStep 5: Determine whether the given information allows us to infer the negated statement.\n\nThe given statement only tells us that if Jeff plays basketball, then Amy plays tennis. It does not provide any information about what happens when Jeff does not play basketball. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis based on the given information alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
