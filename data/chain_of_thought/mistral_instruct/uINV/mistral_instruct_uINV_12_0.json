The statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" means that whenever Joe goes to the park, Lucy goes to the zoo. However, it does not necessarily mean that whenever Lucy goes to the zoo, Joe goes to the park.\n\nNow let's consider the reverse conditional statement \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\" This statement implies that whenever Joe stays home from the park, Lucy also stays home from the zoo.\n\nHowever, based on the given information, we cannot be sure that this is always true. It's possible that there have been instances where Joe stayed home from the park while Lucy went to the zoo, or vice versa. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo, based on the given information alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
