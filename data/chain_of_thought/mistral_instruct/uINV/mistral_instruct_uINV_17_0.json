However, it does not necessarily mean that if Q is false (Kate did not eat salad), then P must also be false (Ben did not eat pasta).\n\nStep 3: Consider a counterexample\n\nLet's consider a possible scenario where Ben did not eat pasta but Kate still ate salad. For example, Ben might have had pizza instead of pasta, or he might have decided to skip dinner altogether. In this case, the statement \"if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" would be false for that particular instance, but it does not imply that \"if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad\" is always true.\n\nStep 4: Conclude\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and reasoning, we cannot infer that if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad.
