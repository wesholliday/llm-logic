It means that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow. But it does not imply anything about what happens when the apple is not red.\n\nStep 3: Consider the inverse condition\n\nThe inverse of this condition would be \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\" This statement is not given in the question, so we cannot infer it based on the information provided.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\n\nAnswer: no.",
