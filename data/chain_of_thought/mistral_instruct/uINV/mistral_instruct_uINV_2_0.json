It tells us that under certain conditions (the griffin being in the forest), another condition (the unicorn also being in the forest) holds true.\n\nHowever, this statement does not tell us anything about what happens when the first condition is not met (when the griffin is not in the forest). Therefore, based on the given information alone, we cannot infer that if the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no.",
