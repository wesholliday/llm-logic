If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race as well (given information).\n2. However, just because Alex finished the race does not necessarily mean that Chris also finished before Alex crossed the finish line. They could have finished at the same time.\n3. To infer that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish either, we would need to know that Chris cannot finish the race without Alex finishing first (for example, they are racing in a relay where one person hands off the baton to the other).\n4. Without this additional information, we cannot make such an assumption based on the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
