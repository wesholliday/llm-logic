The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement that describes a relationship where if one condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then another condition (Sue being at the wedding) is also true.\n\nHowever, this statement does not necessarily mean that if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not there as well. It only tells us that if Mary was present, Sue was also present. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not there based on the given information alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
