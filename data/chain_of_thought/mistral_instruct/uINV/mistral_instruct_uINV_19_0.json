However, it does not necessarily mean that if q (Jen watches basketball) is false, then p (Tom watches football) must also be false.\n\nStep 3: Consider the reverse of the given statement\n\nThe reverse statement \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football\" is not given in the problem. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball based on the given information alone.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\n\nAnswer: no.",
