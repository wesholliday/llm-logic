It does not necessarily mean that when the dog is not inside, the cat must be outside.\n\nStep 3: To determine if we can infer that when the dog is not inside, the cat is not outside, we need to consider all possible scenarios.\n\nStep 4: Let's list some possibilities:\n1) Dog is inside, cat is outside\n2) Dog is outside, cat is inside\n3) Dog and cat are both inside\n4) Dog and cat are both outside\n\nStep 5: Based on the given statement, we know that scenario 1 is true. However, scenarios 2 and 4 are also possible, as there's no information provided about what happens when the dog is not inside.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, we cannot infer that if the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside, based on the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
