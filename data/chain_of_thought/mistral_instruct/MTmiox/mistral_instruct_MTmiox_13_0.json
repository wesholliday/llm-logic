The reason is that the first statement only suggests a possibility that the glip did not traverse something, while the second statement explains the necessary condition for slogging to occur and the resulting tragg action. It does not exclude the possibility of the glip being slogged without leaving a traverse mark or without the substance being identified in the given context.\n\nAnswer: no.",
