It does not necessarily mean that the wug was not garpled, but it leaves open the possibility.\n2. \"If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled.\" This conditional statement means that if the wug was sproinged (which is an action), then it had to be garpled (another action). It does not provide any information about whether or not the wug was actually sproinged.\n3. Based on this information, we cannot infer \"The wug was not sproinged.\" The given statements do not provide enough evidence to make that conclusion. Answer: no.",
