If the snow was not compacted or crushed (not crampled), then it is still possible that it did not grow the frink (as stated in statement 1).\n2. However, if the snow was compacted or crushed (crampled), then according to statement 2, it must have grown the frink.\n3. Therefore, if we know that the frink did not grow (from statement 1), then we can infer that the snow was not compacted or crushed (not crampled).\n\nSo, based on the given statements, we can infer 'The sneg was not crampled'.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
