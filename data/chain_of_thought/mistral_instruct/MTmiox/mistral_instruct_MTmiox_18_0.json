The first statement leaves open the possibility that the shank was not nugged at all, while the second statement assumes that if it was plooked, then it must have been nugged as well. But we cannot infer for certain that the shank was not plooked based on these statements alone.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: no.",
