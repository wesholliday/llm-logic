It does not necessarily mean that the flug was not zimmed for sure, just that it's a possibility.\n2. \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed\" - This conditional statement is saying that if the flug was blummed (again, whatever that means), then it follows logically that the flug must have also been zimmed.\n3. From these two statements, we cannot infer \"The flug was not blummed\". The reason being that neither statement definitively states that the flug was not blummed or zimmed. It's possible that the flug was neither blummed nor zimmed based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no.",
