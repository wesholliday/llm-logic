The first statement is \"The flugel might not have been zargled.\" This means that there is a possibility that the flugel was not zargled. It does not necessarily mean that it wasn't blimmed or that the two events are mutually exclusive.\n2. The second statement is \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled.\" This conditional statement means that if the flugel was blimmed, then zargling is a necessary consequence. It does not imply that the flugel was actually blimmed or that it was the only possible outcome when the flugel was blimmed.\n3. From these statements alone, we cannot infer \"The flugel was not blimmed.\" The first statement leaves open the possibility that the flugel was neither zargled nor blimmed, while the second statement does not necessarily contradict this possibility.
