It does not necessarily mean that it wasn't bluttered (wet or covered in something else), just that it might not have been surned specifically.\n2. \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\" This conditional statement implies that if the fleeg was bluttered (wet or covered in something), then it would have had to be surned (painted or coated with something) to explain the wetness or covering.\n3. However, the first statement does not definitively state that the fleeg was not bluttered; it only suggests that it might not have been surned. Therefore, even if we assume that being bluttered and surned are mutually exclusive (which is not necessarily true), we cannot infer \"The fleeg was not bluttered\" from these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
