The first statement does not provide enough information to infer that the smip was not shripped. It only states that there is a possibility that the smip did not lift the zoint, but it does not rule out the possibility that the smip was stripped and lifted the zoint.\n2. The second statement states that if the smip was stripped, then it must have lifted the zoint. This statement does not provide any information about whether or not the smip was stripped.\n3. Therefore, based on the given statements alone, we cannot infer that \"The smip was not shripped\".\n\nAnswer: no.",
