However, it does not necessarily mean that the sprocket was not cranked.\n2. \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled\" implies that if the sprocket was turned or rotated (cranked), then it would have been damaged in some way (daggled). This statement suggests a causal relationship between cranking the sprocket and damaging it.\n3. From these statements alone, we cannot infer \"The sprocket was not cranked.\" While it's possible that the sprocket wasn't cranked to avoid damaging it, there could also be other reasons why the sprocket might not have been daggled even if it was cranked. For example, someone may have taken care to ensure that the sprocket was properly lubricated or handled with care while cranking it.\n\nAnswer: no.",
