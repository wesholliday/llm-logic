However, just because the dreb might not have been spent does not necessarily mean that it was not vroombed. It's possible for the dreb to have been spent without being vroombed, or for it to have neither been spent nor vroombed.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The dreb was not vroombed\" from these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
