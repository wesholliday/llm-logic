It's not the case that the wug must have been garpled. This statement means that there is no guarantee or certainty that the wug was garpled. It could be that the wug was not garpled at all.\n2. If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled. This conditional statement indicates that if the event of \"sproing\" occurred, then the event of \"garpling\" must also have occurred.\n\nNow let's consider the possibility of the wug being both sproinged and garpled:\n\n1. If the wug was both sproinged and garpled, then according to statement 2, it must have been garpled. However, statement 1 tells us that it's not necessary for the wug to be garpled. This creates a contradiction.\n\nSince we cannot have the wug being both sproinged and garpled without creating a contradiction, it follows that:\n\nAnswer: The wug was not sproinged.",
