It does not necessarily mean that the dreb was not vroombed, as spending could occur through other means besides vroombing.\n2. \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened\": This conditional statement indicates that if the dreb was vroombed, then it follows that the dreb was spent. However, this does not mean that every time the dreb is spent, it is vroombed.\n3. From these two statements alone, we cannot infer \"The dreb was not vroombed.\" The first statement leaves open the possibility that the dreb was not vroombed at all, while the second statement only tells us that if the dreb was vroombed, then it was spent. We don't have enough information to definitively say that the dreb was not vroombed based on these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
