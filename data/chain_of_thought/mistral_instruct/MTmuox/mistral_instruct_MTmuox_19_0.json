It's not the case that the smonk must have plagiarized (denial of the conclusion in statement 1)\n2. If the smonk was vreebled (condition in statement 2), then the smonk must have plagiarized (conclusion in statement 2)\n\nWe cannot directly infer \"The smonk was not vreebled\" from these statements because:\n\n1. Statement 1 denies that the smonk must have plagiarized, but it does not necessarily mean that the smonk was not vreebled. It only means that there is no sufficient evidence to prove that the smonk plagiarized.\n2. Statement 2 establishes a conditional relationship between being vreebled and plagiarizing, but it doesn't provide any information about whether or not the smonk was actually vreebled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The smonk was not vreebled\" based on the given statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
