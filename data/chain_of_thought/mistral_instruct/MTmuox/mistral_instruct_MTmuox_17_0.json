We know that \"It's not the case that the flob must have moved.\" This means that there is no necessity for the flob to have moved.\n2. Next, we have \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have moved.\" This conditional statement tells us that if the flob was skizzled (which is a cause), then the flob must have moved (which is an effect).\n3. However, we don't have any information about whether or not the flob was skizzled in the given statements.\n4. To infer \"The flob was not skizzled,\" we would need to know that it couldn't have been skizzled based on the available information. But since there is no such information provided, we cannot make this inference.\n\nAnswer: No.",
