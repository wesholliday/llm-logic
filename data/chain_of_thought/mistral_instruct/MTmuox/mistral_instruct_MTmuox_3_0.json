It's not the case that the splat must have quanked (this statement negates that the splat quanked)\n2. If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked (this statement asserts that morphing the splat leads to quanking)\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot directly infer \"The splat was not morphed.\" The reason is that the first statement tells us that it's not necessary for the splat to have quanked, but it doesn't tell us that morphing the splat is impossible without quanking. Therefore, there could still be a possibility that the splat was morphed and did quank, which would make both statements true at the same time.\n\nAnswer: no.",
