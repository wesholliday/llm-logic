It's not the case that the fribble must have crinked. This statement means that there is a possibility that the fribble did not crink even if it was snurgled.\n2. If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked. This conditional statement implies that if the fribble was snurgled, then crinkling is a necessary consequence.\n3. However, we know from statement 1 that it's not necessarily true that the fribble must crink when it's snurgled. Therefore, even though snurgeling might cause crinkling in some cases, it does not have to be the case that it always does.\n4. Since there is a possibility that the fribble did not crink when it was snurgled (as stated in statement 1), we cannot infer that \"The fribble was not snurgled\" based on the given statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
