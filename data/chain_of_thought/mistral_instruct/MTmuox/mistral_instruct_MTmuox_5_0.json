It's not the case that the zinger must have been smoogled. This means that there is at least one possible scenario where the zinger was not smoogled.\n2. If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger must have been smoogled. This statement establishes a conditional relationship between being fragged and being smoogled.\n\nNow let's consider the inference we want to make: 'The zinger was not fraggled'.\n\nTo infer this from the given statements, we would need to use the principle of contrapositive, which states that if 'If P then Q' is a true statement, then 'If not Q then not P' is also true.\n\nHowever, in order to apply the principle of contrapositive, we would need to know that 'The zinger was not fragged' implies 'The zinger was not smoogled'. But we don't have enough information to make that assumption.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements alone, we cannot infer 'The zinger was not fraggled'.\n\nAnswer: no.",
