Let's analyze the given statements:\n\n1. It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled.\n2. If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled.\n\nThe first statement tells us that it is not necessary for a daggled sprocket to exist. The second statement establishes a conditional relationship: if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled.\n\nHowever, these statements do not directly allow us to infer that \"The sprocket was not cranked.\" To make such an inference, we would need to know that the negation of the second statement is true: \"If the sprocket was not cranked, then it was not daggled.\" But this information is not provided.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements alone, we cannot infer that \"The sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
