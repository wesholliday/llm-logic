It's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned. (This statement negates that the fleeg being surned is a necessary condition.)\n2. If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned. (This conditional statement asserts that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it had to be surned.)\n\nNow let's consider the possible implications of these statements:\n\n1. The first statement tells us that the fleeg not being surned is a possibility when the fleeg is not bluttered.\n2. The second statement asserts that if the fleeg is bluttered, then it must be surned.\n3. However, the first statement also indicates that there are cases where the fleeg is not bluttered and not surned.\n4. Since the second statement only applies when the fleeg is bluttered, it doesn't contradict the first statement.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The fleeg was not bluttered\" from these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
