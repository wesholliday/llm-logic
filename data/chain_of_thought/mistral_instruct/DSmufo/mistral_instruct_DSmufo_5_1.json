We know that the cookies do not have to be hidden in the pantry (from the first statement).\n2. The second statement tells us that there are only two possibilities for where the cookies can be: either they must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar.\n3. Since we already know that the cookies do not have to be hidden in the pantry, it means that the first possibility (cookies being hidden in the pantry) does not apply.\n4. However, the second possibility (cookies being in the jar) could still be true.\n5. Therefore, even though we cannot definitively say where the cookies are based on this information alone, we also cannot infer that they are not in the jar, as there is still a possibility that they could be there.\n6. In summary, since neither statement allows us to conclude that the cookies are definitely in the pantry or in the jar, and one statement contradicts the other, we cannot infer \"The cookies are in the jar\" based on this information alone.",

Either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given statements\n\nGiven statement number 1 tells us that the cookies do not have to be hidden in the pantry. However, it does not tell us anything about where they are actually located. Statement number 2 presents a contradiction - it states that either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar. If we accept statement 1 as true, then statement 2 is false because the cookies can be somewhere other than the pantry and still not be hidden (i.e., they could be in the jar).\n\nStep 3: Eliminate contradictions\n\nSince statement 2 is a contradiction with respect to statement 1, we cannot accept both statements as true. Therefore, one of them must be false. Given that statement 1 is true and does not limit the possible locations for the cookies, it follows that statement 2 is false.\n\nStep 4: Identify conclusions\n\nSince statement 2 is false, its negation (i.e., \"The cookies are not in the pantry and they are not in the jar\") is true. However, since we don't have enough information from the given statements to determine exactly where the cookies are, we cannot infer that they are specifically in the jar.
