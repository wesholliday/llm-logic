Given A: 'The toy is sitting on the bookshelf' and \u00acA: 'It's not the case that the toy is sitting on the bookshelf', since we have neither proven A nor \u00acA false, both are possible.\n3. Since the disjunction of two statements 'P or Q' is true when either P or Q (or both) is true, and given that 'The toy must be sitting on the bookshelf' is falsified by statement 1, then the only other possibility for the disjunction to be true is if the second statement 'It is in the toy box' holds.\n4.
