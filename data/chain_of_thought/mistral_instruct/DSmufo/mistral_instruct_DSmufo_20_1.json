Either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the logical structure of the given information\n\nFirst, we need to understand that 'It's not the case that X must be Y' is logically equivalent to 'X cannot be Y.' So, we have:\n\nCannot: The sunglasses must be perched on her head.\nOr: The sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nStep 3: Apply logical reasoning\n\nSince we know that the sunglasses cannot be perched on her head, and the only other alternative given is that they are in her bag, then it follows logically that:\n\nAnswer: Yes, the sunglasses are in her bag.",

Statement 2 is stating two possible locations for the sunglasses - either on her head or in her bag, but not both at the same time (an \"either-or\" statement).\n\nStep 3: Combine the statements and examine possibilities\n\nIf Statement 1 were true, then the sunglasses could be anywhere except perched on her head. However, if Statement 2 is also true, that means the sunglasses are either on her head or in her bag. This creates a contradiction since Statement 1 denies that they must be on her head but Statement 2 says they could be.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion based on logical reasoning\n\nSince Statement 1 and Statement 2 seem to create an inconsistency, it is likely that one of the statements is false or incomplete. Given the context, it's more plausible that Statement 1 might have been misspoken, and the correct intention was \"it's not necessarily the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n\nWith this understanding, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n- Scenario 1 (Statement 1 is incorrect): In this case, it would mean the sunglasses can indeed be perched on her head, but Statement 2 also states they could be in her bag. Thus, based on given information, neither statement explicitly tells us that the sunglasses are in her bag, so we cannot infer that definitively.\n- Scenario 2 (Statement 2 is incorrect): However, if Statement 2 were incorrect - and there was no implication that the sunglasses must be either on her head or in her bag - then it would not prevent other possibilities for the sunglasses' location. This scenario does not allow us to infer with certainty that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nConsidering both scenarios and their implications, neither can definitively conclude the sunglasses are in her bag based on given statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
