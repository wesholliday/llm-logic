We know that \"it's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\" This means that the notebook can be in some other location besides the nightstand.\n2. The second statement is \"Either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer.\" This is a disjunction, meaning it could be either A (the notebook is on the nightstand) or B (the notebook is in the drawer).\n3. However, just because we know that A is not true (it's not on the nightstand), it does not automatically follow that B must be true (it's in the drawer). There could be other locations for the notebook as well that we don't have information about.\n4.
