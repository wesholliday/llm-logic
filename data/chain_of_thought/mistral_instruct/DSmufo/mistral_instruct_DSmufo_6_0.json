We also know that either the phone must be ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room.\n3. However, we cannot infer that the phone is in the living room based on this information alone. The second statement only tells us that one of two possibilities is true - either the phone is ringing in the kitchen or it's in the living room. It does not necessarily mean that if the phone isn't ringing in the kitchen, then it must be in the living room. There could be other possible locations for the phone as well.",
