If one condition is not true, then the other must be true. In this case, if the jacket is not hanging in the closet, it can only mean that it is draped over the chair.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis\n\nGiven Statement 1 and Statement 2, we can infer that if the jacket is not hanging in the closet (as stated in Statement 1), then it must be draped over the chair (as stated in the second, but not explicitly mentioned in Statement 1).\n\nStep 4: Provide the final answer\n\nAnswer: yes.",
