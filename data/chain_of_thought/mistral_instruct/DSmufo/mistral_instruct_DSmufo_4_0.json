The first alternative is \"the cat must be playing in the bedroom,\" and the second alternative is \"it's napping on the couch.\" Since these alternatives are mutually exclusive, they cannot both be true at the same time.\n\nStep 3: Determine if we can infer 'The cat is napping on the couch' from the given statements\n\nSince Statement 1 tells us that it's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom, this means that the first alternative of Statement 2 cannot be true. Therefore, the second alternative, \"it's napping on the couch,\" must be true for the entire statement to hold.\n\nAnswer: yes",
