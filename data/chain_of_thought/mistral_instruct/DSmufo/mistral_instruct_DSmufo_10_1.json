It doesn't mean the missing sock cannot be under the bed, but only that it's not a required situation.\n\nStatement 2: This statement provides two mutually exclusive alternatives for the location of the missing sock. If one alternative is false, then the other must be true. In this case, if the sock isn't under the bed, then it must be in the laundry basket.\n\nStep 3: Let's examine how these statements relate to each other and what we can infer based on their logical relationship:\n\nGiven Statement 1: The missing sock is not necessarily under the bed.\nGiven Statement 2: The missing sock must be either under the bed or in the laundry basket.\n\nSince Statement 1 denies that the missing sock being under the bed is a necessary condition, we know that it's possible for the missing sock to be somewhere other than under the bed (such as the laundry basket). Therefore, if Statement 1 is true, then Statement 2 must also be true because Statement 2 provides an exhaustive list of all the possibilities regarding where the missing sock can be. Thus, Statement 2 logically follows from Statement 1.\n\nStep 4: Based on our analysis, we can infer that 'The missing sock is in the laundry basket' is a valid conclusion, given the two statements provided.\n\nAnswer: yes",
