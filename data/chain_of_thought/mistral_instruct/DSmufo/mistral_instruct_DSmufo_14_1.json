We have two statements: \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" and \"Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter\".\n2. The first statement negates that the milk must be chilling in the fridge. It does not explicitly state that the milk is on the counter, only that it's not in the fridge.\n3. The second statement gives us two possibilities: either the milk is chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter.\n4. Since we already know from the first statement that the milk is not chilling in the fridge, it could still be the case that the milk is on the counter. However, the information given to us does not definitively prove that the milk is on the counter, only that it's not in the fridge.\n5. Therefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer 'The milk is on the counter'. We can only say for certain that 'The milk is not in the fridge'.",

First, let's understand the meaning of the given statements.\n2. \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" means milk does not have to be refrigerated (it can be at room temperature).\n3. \"Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter\" means milk can be either in the fridge or on the counter but cannot be in any other location.\n4. Since milk doesn't have to be in the fridge (it can be on the counter), we cannot infer that \"The milk is on the counter,\" just because \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" and \"Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter.\"\n5. We need additional information to determine if the milk is on the counter or not.\n6. Answer: No.",
