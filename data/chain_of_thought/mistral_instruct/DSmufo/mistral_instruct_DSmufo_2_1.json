The problem with this line of reasoning is that while the second statement does tell us that one possible location for the book is on the shelf, it also states that another possible location is on the table (but that we know from the first statement is not actually the case). We cannot infer for certain that the book is on the shelf just based on these two statements alone.\n5.
