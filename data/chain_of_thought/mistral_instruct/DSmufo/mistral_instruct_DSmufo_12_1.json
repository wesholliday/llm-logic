We are given two statements: \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\" and \"Either the jacket must be hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair.\"\n2. The second statement is an either-or statement, meaning that only one of the two alternatives can be true at a time. Since we know that it's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet, this means that the first alternative (the jacket must be hanging in the closet) cannot be true.\n3.

However, they do allow for the possibility of the jacket being draped over a chair rather than hung in the closet. Based on this information, we cannot definitively infer that 'The jacket is draped over the chair', but we can say that it's possible (since one alternative stated in the second condition has not been ruled out).\n\nAnswer: no.
