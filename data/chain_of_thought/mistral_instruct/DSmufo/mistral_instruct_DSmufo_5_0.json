Statement 1 tells us that the first possibility is not true. Since there's no contradiction with the second possibility, it remains valid.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis\n\nSince neither statement contradicts each other, we cannot directly infer 'The cookies are in the jar' from the given statements alone. However, the second statement does allow for the possibility that the cookies could be in the jar.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The cookies are in the jar' directly from the given statements. But, we can say that according to the second statement, it is possible for the cookies to be in the jar.",
