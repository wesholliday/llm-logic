In this case, the two parts are \"the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" and \"they are in her bag.\" Since Statement 1 tells us that the first part is not true, it follows logically that the second part must be true.\n\nStep 3: Provide the answer\n\nAnswer: yes. The given statements allow us to infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.",
