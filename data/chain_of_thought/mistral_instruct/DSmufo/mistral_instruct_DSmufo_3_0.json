Statement 2 then gives us two possibilities for where the keys could be: either dangling in the cabinet or in the drawer. Since Statement 1 already tells us that the keys don't have to be dangling in the cabinet, this means that the second alternative in Statement 2 must be true.\n\nStep 3: Infer the answer based on the given statements\n\nAnswer: yes (the keys are in the drawer)",
