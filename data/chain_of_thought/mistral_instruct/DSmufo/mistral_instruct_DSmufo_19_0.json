Therefore, Statement 1 does not contradict Statement 2. In fact, Statement 2 provides an alternative explanation for where the watch could be when it's not on his wrist.\n\nStep 3: Determine if we can infer 'The watch is charging on the dresser' from the given statements\n\nNo, we cannot directly infer that 'The watch is charging on the dresser' from the given statements. However, Statement 2 does allow for this possibility, so it's a valid conclusion if there is additional evidence or context suggesting that the watch is indeed charging on the dresker.\n\nAnswer: no.",
