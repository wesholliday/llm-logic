'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow': This statement is a conditional statement. It means that under certain conditions (the apple being red), the banana is guaranteed to be yellow. However, it does not necessarily mean that the apple is always red or that the banana is always yellow.\n2. 'The banana was yellow': This statement is true and describes the color of the banana.\n3. To determine if 'The apple was red' is true, we need to check if the condition in the first statement (the apple being red) holds true. We do not have enough information from the given statements to make that determination.\n4. Therefore, it does not necessarily follow that 'The apple was red' is true based on the given statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
