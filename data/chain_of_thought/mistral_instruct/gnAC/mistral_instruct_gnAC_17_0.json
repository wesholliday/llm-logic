We know that 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad' is a conditional statement. This means that if the first part (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the second part (Kate ate salad) must also be true.\n2. We are given that 'Kate ate salad' is true.\n3. To determine if 'Ben ate pasta' is true, we need to check if the condition in the if statement is also true.\n4. If both parts of a conditional statement are true, then the statement as a whole is considered to be true (known as the truth table for logical implication).\n5. Therefore, since 'Kate ate salad' is true and 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad' is a valid conditional statement, it follows that 'Ben ate pasta' must also be true in order for the entire statement to be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
