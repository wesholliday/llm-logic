We have been given two premises:\n   a) If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den (Conditional Statement 1).\n   b) The wolf was in the den (Fact).\n\n2. To determine if \"The bear was in the cave\" is true, we need to apply the rule of Modus Ponens, which states that if a conditional statement is true and the fact that makes the if-part true is also true, then the consequent of the conditional statement must be true.\n\n3. In our case:\n   a) The conditional statement is \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\"\n   b) The fact that makes the if-part true is \"The wolf was in the den.\"\n\n4. Since both the conditional statement and the fact are given, we can apply Modus Ponens to conclude that the consequent of the conditional statement must be true.\n\n5. Therefore, the consequent of \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" is \"the wolf was in the den,\" and the consequent of our original question is \"The bear was in the cave.\"\n\nAnswer: yes.",
