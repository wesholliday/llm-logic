The statement \"Bob chose pasta\" is a separate fact.\n\nTo determine if it necessarily follows that \"Sue chose pizza\" is true, we need to consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. Scenario where both statements are true: In this case, Sue did choose pizza and Bob did choose pasta, but this does not mean that they made their choices based on each other's selections. It could be a coincidence that they both chose what they did. So, just because Sue would have chosen pizza if Bob had chosen pasta, it doesn't necessarily mean that she did in fact choose pizza when Bob did.\n\nAnswer: no.",
