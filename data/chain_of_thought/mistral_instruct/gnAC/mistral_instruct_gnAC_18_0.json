We know that 'The truck was metal' is true.\n2. From 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal', we can infer that if the doll were plastic, then the truck would have to be metal according to this statement.\n3. However, we don't have any information about what material the doll is made of; it could be plastic or any other material for all we know.\n4. Since the truth of 'The truck was metal' doesn't guarantee that 'The doll was plastic', we cannot directly conclude that 'The doll was plastic' is true based on this information alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
