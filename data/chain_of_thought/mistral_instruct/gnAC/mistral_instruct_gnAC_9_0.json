We know that Mark bought the blue shirt (given information).\n2. The conditional statement tells us that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n3. However, it does not guarantee that Lisa actually bought the red shirt; it only establishes a relationship between her buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt.\n4. Therefore, even though Mark bought the blue shirt and the conditional statement is true, it does not necessarily mean that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: No.",
