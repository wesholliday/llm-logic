We know that \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is true. This means that whenever Sam takes a plane, Erin takes a train.\n2. We also know that Erin took a train.\n3. To find out if Sam took a plane, we need to check if there's a situation where both \"Sam took a plane\" and \"Erin took a train\" are true at the same time.\n4. Based on our given information, yes, it is possible for both statements to be true at the same time because we know that whenever Sam takes a plane, Erin takes a train, and we have been told that Erin took a train.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
