We know that 'The pants were denim'.\n2. From the given conditional statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim', we can infer that if the pants are denim, then the shirt must be cotton according to the rule of implication (modus ponens). However, this inference is not a definitive proof that the shirt is cotton because there could be other possibilities where both conditions are true but the reason stated in the conditional statement is not the actual cause.\n3. To make a definitive conclusion, we would need to know for certain that the reason stated in the conditional statement (the shirt being cotton) is indeed the cause of the pants being denim in this specific situation. Without this information, we cannot be sure that 'The shirt was cotton' is true.\n\nAnswer: no.",
