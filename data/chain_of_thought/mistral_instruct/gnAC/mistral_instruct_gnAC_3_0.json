            "content": " To determine if \"The book was written by James\" is necessarily true given that \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" and \"The book is a mystery novel\" are both true, we need to apply the rules of logic.\n\nFirst, let's establish that \"The book is a mystery novel\" is a conclusion based on the given condition \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This means that the premise \"The book was written by James\" logically implies the conclusion \"The book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the reverse implication. If we know that \"The book is a mystery novel,\" does it necessarily follow that \"The book was written by James\"?\n\nTo answer this question, we need to apply the principle of contrapositive in logic. The contrapositive of \"If P then Q\" is \"If not Q then not P.\" In our case, the given condition is \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel,\" so the contrapositive would be \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\"\n\nSince we know that \"The book is a mystery novel\" is true, its negation, \"The book is not a mystery novel,\" is false. Therefore, according to the contrapositive principle, \"The book was not written by James\" is also false, which means that \"The book was written by James\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
