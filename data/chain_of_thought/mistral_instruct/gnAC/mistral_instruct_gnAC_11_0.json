'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry': This statement is a conditional statement. It means that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. It does not guarantee that the cake is chocolate; it only establishes a relationship between the cake being chocolate and the muffins being blueberry.\n2. 'The muffins were blueberry': This statement is true, but it doesn't provide any information about the cake.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to determine if the cake was chocolate or not, it does not necessarily follow that 'The cake was chocolate' is true.\n\nAnswer: no.",
