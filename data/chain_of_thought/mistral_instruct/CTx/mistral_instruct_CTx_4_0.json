If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked (P -> Q)\n\nThis statement means that whenever the condition P (the fribble being snurgled) is true, the consequence Q (the fribble crinked) is also true. It does not necessarily mean that when Q is false (the fribble did not crink), P must be false as well.\n\nTo infer 'If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled' (~Q -> ~P), we need to prove that whenever Q is false, P must also be false. However, based on the given information, this cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, we cannot make such an inference with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no.",
