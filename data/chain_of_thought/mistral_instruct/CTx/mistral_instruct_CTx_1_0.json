'If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled': This statement is an implication, meaning that if the condition (the flugel being blimmed) is true, then the consequence (the flugel being zargled) must also be true.\n2. 'If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed': This statement is the contrapositive of the original implication. The contrapositive is formed by swapping the hypothesis and the conclusion and negating both.\n3. To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to check if they are logically equivalent (meaning they convey the same information) or not.\n4. Let's analyze the contrapositive: 'If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed'. This statement implies that if the condition (the flugel not being zargled) is true, then the consequence (the flugel not being blimmed) must also be true.\n5. Now let's consider the original implication: 'If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled'. This statement implies that if the condition (the flugel being blimmed) is true, then the consequence (the flugel being zargled) must also be true.\n6. To check for logical equivalence, we need to ensure that both statements have the same implications. In other words, if one statement is true, then the other must also be true, and vice versa.\n7. Let's test this by assuming the negation of each statement:\n   - If the flugel was not blimmed (negation of 'If the flugel was blimmed'), then the flugel was not zargled (according to the original implication). This is consistent with our second statement, 'If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed'.\n   - If the flugel was not zargled (negation of 'If the flugel was zargled'), then the flugel was not blimmed (according to our second statement). This is consistent with the original implication, 'If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled'.\n8. Since both statements are consistent with each other's negations, they are logically equivalent.\n9. Therefore, we can infer 'If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed' from 'If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
