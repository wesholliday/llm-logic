Without any context or definition provided, it is impossible to know for certain what these terms mean. However, we can make some assumptions based on their similarity in sound to common English words.\n\nIf we assume that \"plooked\" means \"poked\" and \"nugged\" means \"handled roughly\", then the first statement could be interpreted as meaning that if the shank was poked, it was also handled roughly. This does not necessarily mean that every time a shank is handled roughly, it is poked. It only implies that if it is poked, it will be handled roughly.\n\nThe second statement, 'If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked', would imply that if the shank was not handled roughly, it was also not poked. However, this is not necessarily true based on our interpretation of the first statement. It's possible for a shank to be poked without being handled roughly, or for it to be handled roughly without being poked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked' from 'If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged', based on our assumptions about the meanings of \"plooked\" and \"nugged\".\n\nAnswer: no.",
