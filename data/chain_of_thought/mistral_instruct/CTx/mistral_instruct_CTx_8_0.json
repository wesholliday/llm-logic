This statement implies that whenever the sprocket is cranked, it will be in the daggled state. However, it does not necessarily mean that whenever the sprocket is not daggled, it was not cranked. There could be other reasons why the sprocket is not daggled, such as it being at rest or properly aligned. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked' based on the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
