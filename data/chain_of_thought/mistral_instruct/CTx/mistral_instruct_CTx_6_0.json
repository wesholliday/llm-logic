'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink': This statement establishes a conditional relationship between two events - if the grommet is sploffed (splattered or damaged), then it plops the frink (drops something called frink).\n2. 'If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed': This statement also establishes a conditional relationship between two events - if the grommet did not drop anything called frink, then it was not sploffed.\n3. To infer that 'If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed' from 'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink', we need to apply the principle of contrapositive in logic. The contrapositive of 'If A then B' is 'If not B then not A'.\n4. In our case, the original statement is 'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink'. To find its contrapositive, we need to negate both parts: 'If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed'.\n5. Since our inferred statement matches the contrapositive of the original statement, we can conclude that it is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
