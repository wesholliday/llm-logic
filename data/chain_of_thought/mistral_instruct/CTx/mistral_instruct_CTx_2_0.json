'If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint': This statement implies that when the wug is flooped (or in a state of being flooped), it bims the zoint. In other words, there's a cause-and-effect relationship between being flooped and bimming the zoint.\n2. 'If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped': This statement suggests that if the wug didn't bim the zoint, it wasn't in a state of being flooped. In other words, there's a cause-and-effect relationship between not bimming the zoint and not being flooped.\n\nNow let's compare both statements:\n\n1. They have the same 'if...then...' structure.\n2. Both statements involve the wug and the zoint.\n3. However, they make different claims about the relationship between the wug's state (flooped or not) and its action (bimming the zoint or not).\n\nTo infer that 'If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped', we would need to have enough information to establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship between not bimming the zoint and not being flooped. However, from the given statement 'If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint', we cannot infer that directly.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: no.",
