However, we don't know what \"surn\" means in this context. It could be an unrelated event or condition.\n2. \"If the fleeg did not surn, then the fleeg was not bluttered\": This statement suggests that if a fleeg does not surm (whatever that means), then it was not buttered (bluttered).\n3. To infer this second statement from the first, we would need to know that \"surn\" and \"being buttered\" are mutually exclusive events or conditions. In other words, if a fleeg is not surm-ing, it cannot be buttered at the same time. Without this information, we cannot make such an inference.\n\nAnswer: No.",
