Compacted snow does not cause snow to grow or produce anything.\n\n2. \"If the snow did not sprout the frink, then the snow was not compacted\": This is a reverse implication of the first statement and also false for the same reason as above - snow cannot sprout anything, so its compactness does not determine whether it sprouts a frink or not.\n\nNow let's consider their relationship:\n\nThe given conditional statement \"If the snow was compacted, then the snow sprouted the frink\" is false. A false conditional statement does not provide any basis for inferring a new conditional statement. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the snow did not sprout the frink, then the snow was not compacted\" from it.\n\nAnswer: no.",
