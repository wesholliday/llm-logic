It does not necessarily mean that every time the smip is shripped, it will lup the zoint; only that whenever the smip is shripped, it results in the smip lupping the zoint.\n\n2. \"If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped\": This statement is an inverse of the first one, stating that if the consequence (smip not lupping the zoint) is true, then the condition (smip not being shripped) must also be true.\n\nTo infer this second statement from the first, we would need to prove that the absence of the consequence always implies the absence of the condition. However, the original statements do not provide enough information to make such a definitive conclusion.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to infer \"If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
