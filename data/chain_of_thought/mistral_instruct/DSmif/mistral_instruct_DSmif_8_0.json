It states that the remote control could be either hiding under the couch or on the coffee table. This means that if the remote control was not hiding under the couch, then it must be on the coffee table according to this statement.\n\nStep 3: Now let's consider Statement 2. It states that the remote control is not hiding under the couch.\n\nStep 4: Since both statements suggest that if the remote control is not hiding under the couch, then it must be on the coffee table, and Statement 2 confirms that the remote control is not hiding under the couch, we can infer that the remote control is indeed on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
