We know that the notebook can either be on the nightstand or in the drawer.\n2. We also know that it's possible for the notebook to not be on the nightstand.\n3. However, we don't have any information that definitively states that the notebook is in the drawer. It could still be somewhere else, such as a different table or even lost.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer \"The notebook is in the drawer.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
