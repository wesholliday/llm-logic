It does not guarantee that Fido is inside, but it does rule out other possibilities (like Fido being at the park, or on a walk, etc.).\n\nStatement 2: \"Fido might not be in the garden\" - This statement suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. However, it does not necessarily mean that Fido is inside. It could also mean that Fido is somewhere else entirely (like at the vet, or on a walk).\n\nStep 3: To determine if we can infer \"Fido is inside\" from these two statements, let's consider all possible scenarios:\n\nScenario A: Fido is inside - In this case, both statements are true. Statement 1 is true because Fido cannot be in the garden (he's inside), and Statement 2 is true because there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden (he's actually inside).\n\nScenario B: Fido is in the garden - In this case, both statements are false. Statement 1 is false because Fido is in the garden, and Statement 2 is false because Fido is indeed in the garden (so it's not true that he might not be).\n\nStep 4: Based on our analysis, we cannot infer \"Fido is inside\" from the given statements alone. There are other possibilities (like Fido being at the vet or on a walk) that could make both statements true.\n\nAnswer: no.",
