Here's why:\n\n1. We know that the pen can either be on the desk or in the bag.\n2. We also know that the pen might not be on the desk.\n3. However, not being on the desk does not necessarily mean it is in the bag. It could be anywhere else or even not with me at all.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The pen is in my bag' based on this information alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
