It states that the toy can only be in one of two places - either on the bookshelf or in the toy box.\n\nStep 3: Now let's consider Statement 2. It states that the toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf, which means it could be somewhere else.\n\nStep 4: Since Statement 1 does not allow for any other possibilities besides the bookshelf or the toy box, and Statement 2 tells us that the toy is not on the bookshelf, we can infer that the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
