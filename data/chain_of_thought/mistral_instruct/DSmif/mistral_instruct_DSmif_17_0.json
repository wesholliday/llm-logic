The first statement only tells us that if the scarf is not on the coat rack, then it must be in the backpack. The second statement informs us of a possibility that the scarf might not be on the coat rack, but it does not necessarily mean that it is in the backpack. Therefore, there could be other possibilities such as the scarf being in another location or even lost. Answer: no.",
