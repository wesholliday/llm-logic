It does not exclude the possibility of the jacket being on a different piece of furniture or even not worn at all.\n\nStatement 2: This statement informs us that the jacket might not be hanging in the closet, which means it could be in another location such as draped over a chair or worn.\n\nStep 3: Now let's consider both statements together.\n\nSince Statement 1 does not exclude the possibility of the jacket being on a different piece of furniture or even not worn at all, and Statement 2 only tells us that it might not be hanging in the closet, we cannot definitively infer that the jacket is draped over the chair based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
