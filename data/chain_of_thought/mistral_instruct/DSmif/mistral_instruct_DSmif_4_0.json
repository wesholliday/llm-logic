It gives us two possibilities for the cat's location, but it doesn't exclude any other locations. So, if the cat is not in the bedroom playing, it could still be somewhere else.\n\nStep 3: Now let's consider Statement 2. This statement tells us that the cat is not playing in the bedroom. It does not provide any information about where the cat might be instead.\n\nStep 4: Based on the given statements, we cannot definitively conclude that 'The cat is napping on the couch'. The statements only tell us that the cat is not playing in the bedroom. There could be other possibilities for where the cat might be.\n\nAnswer: No.",
