It could be in a pocket, in a drawer, or even lost.\n\nStep 3: Now let's consider both statements together.\n\nSince Statement 1 states that the only two possibilities for the watch are on the wrist or on the dresser, and Statement 2 implies that it might not be on his wrist, we cannot directly infer that the watch is charging on the dresser based on these two statements alone. There could be other possibilities as well, such as the watch being in a pocket or lost.\n\nAnswer: No.",
