If there is a contradiction, then we cannot make the inference.\n\nStep 4: Let's examine the possibilities:\n\nIf the sunglasses are on her head, then they are not in her bag (according to Statement 1). However, Statement 2 only states that they might not be on her head and does not necessarily mean they are in her bag. So there is no contradiction.\n\nOn the other hand, if the sunglasses are in her bag, then they are not perched on her head (according to Statement 1). This aligns with Statement 2, as it also states that they might not be perched on her head. Therefore, there is no contradiction.\n\nStep 5: Since there is no contradiction between the two statements, we cannot infer that the sunglasses are in her bag based on the given information alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
