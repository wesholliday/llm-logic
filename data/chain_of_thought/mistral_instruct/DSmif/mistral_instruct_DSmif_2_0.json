It states that the book can only be in one of two places - either on the table or on the shelf.\n\nStep 3: Now let's consider Statement 2. It suggests that the book might not be on the table, but it does not necessarily mean that the book is on the shelf. The statement could also imply that the book is somewhere else entirely.\n\nStep 4: Since we cannot definitively conclude that the book is on the shelf based on the given information, the answer is 'Answer: no'.",
