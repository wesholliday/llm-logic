The first statement \"The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand\" only tells us that the notebook is not in one possible location, but it does not provide enough information to determine where the notebook actually is. The second statement \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand\" presents two possibilities, and while it is true that if the notebook is not on the nightstand then it could be in the drawer, there could also be other possible locations for the notebook that we don't know about. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The notebook is in the drawer.\" Answer: no.",
