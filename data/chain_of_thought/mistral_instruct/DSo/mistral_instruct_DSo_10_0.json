However, we know from Statement 1 that it's not under the bed.\n\nStep 3: Eliminate contradictory information\n\nSince Statement 1 and one part of Statement 2 (the part about the missing sock being under the bed) contradict each other, we cannot accept both statements as true in their entirety. In order to maintain logical consistency, we must eliminate the contradictory information.\n\nStep 4: Determine the valid statement\n\nGiven that Statement 1 is not contradicted by Statement 2 (as Statement 2 only presents an alternative possibility for the missing sock's location, which has been ruled out by Statement 1), and that Statement 1 is a more specific piece of information than Statement 2, we can conclude that Statement 1 is the valid statement.\n\nStep 5: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: no, we cannot infer 'The missing sock is in the laundry basket' based on the given information. Instead, we know for certain that 'The missing sock isn't under the bed'.",
