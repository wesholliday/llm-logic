For example, the book could be lying on the floor, in someone's hands, or in a different room entirely. However, since no such alternative locations are mentioned in the given information, it is impossible to determine the exact location of the book based on the available information alone.\n\nStep 5: Answer the question.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The book is on the shelf' from 'The book isn't resting on the table' and 'Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table'.",
