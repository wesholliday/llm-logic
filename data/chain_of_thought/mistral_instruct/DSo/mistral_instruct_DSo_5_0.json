Since we know from Statement 1 that they are not hidden in the pantry, the only remaining possibility is that they are in the jar.\n\nStep 3: Combine the statements to reach a conclusion.\n\n- Given Statement 1 and Statement 2, we can infer that the cookies are indeed in the jar (since they cannot be hidden in the pantry according to Statement 1, and they must either be in the jar or hidden in the pantry according to Statement 2).\n\nAnswer: yes.",
