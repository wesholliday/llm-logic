The first statement says that the phone isn't ringing in the kitchen, while the second statement suggests that either the phone is in the living room or it is ringing in the kitchen. If the phone were in the living room and ringing, then both statements would be true at the same time, which is not possible according to the given information. Therefore, we cannot infer that the phone is in the living room based on these statements alone.",
