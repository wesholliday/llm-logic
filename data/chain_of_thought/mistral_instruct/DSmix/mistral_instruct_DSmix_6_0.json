If 'The grommet is sploffed' is true, then 'It must be plopped' cannot be true because 'sploffed' implies that the grommet cannot be plopped. So, 'The grommet might not be plopped' is consistent with 'The grommet is sploffed'.\n2. If 'The grommet is not sploffed', then it must be 'plopped'. However, 'The grommet might not be plopped' states that there is a possibility that it was not plopped. This creates a contradiction because if it can be plopped, then it should have been plopped since we assumed it was not sploffed.\n3. Therefore, the only consistent scenario is 'The grommet is sploffed'.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
