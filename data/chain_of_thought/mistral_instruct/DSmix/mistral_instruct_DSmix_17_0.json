However, Statement 2 introduces a third possibility - the flob might not be movated at all. This new information contradicts the original statement, as it implies that there is another possibility besides being skizzled and being movated.\n\nStep 3: Determine if we can infer 'The flob is skizzled'.\n\nNo, we cannot infer 'The flob is skizzled' based on the given statements. The new information in Statement 2 contradicts Statement 1, making it impossible to make such a conclusion with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no.",
