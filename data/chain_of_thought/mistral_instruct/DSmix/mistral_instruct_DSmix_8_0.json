The sprocket might not be daggled\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given statements\n\nThe first statement suggests that there are only two possibilities for the state of the sprocket - either it is cranked or it is daggled. However, the second statement introduces a third possibility that the sprocket might not be daggled at all.\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of each possibility\n\nIf the sprocket is cranked, then according to the first statement, it cannot be daggled. But if the sprocket might not be daggled at all (as stated in the second statement), then it follows that the sprocket must be cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
