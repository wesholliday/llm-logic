            "content": " Step 1: Understand the given information.\n\nGiven information: If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. However, it's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo if Joe went to the park.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the implications of each statement.\n\nStatement 1 (Joe goes to the park, therefore Lucy goes to the zoo): This is a conditional statement with an \"if-then\" relationship. It means that whenever Joe goes to the park, Lucy goes to the zoo as well. However, it does not necessarily mean that Lucy always goes to the zoo when Joe goes to the park; it only means that she goes to the zoo on those specific occasions when Joe goes to the park.\n\nStatement 2 (Lucy doesn't have to go to the zoo if Joe goes to the park): This statement indicates that there are instances where Lucy does not go to the zoo even though Joe goes to the park. This means that the relationship between their activities is not always consistent; it depends on the particular situation.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possibility of Joe not going to the park.\n\nSince we know that Lucy doesn't have to go to the zoo if Joe stays home or goes somewhere other than the park, this means that there are situations where both Joe and Lucy engage in different activities. Therefore, it is possible for Joe not to go to the park without implying that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nStep 4: Formulate the answer based on the analysis.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that Joe did not go to the park based on the given information.",
