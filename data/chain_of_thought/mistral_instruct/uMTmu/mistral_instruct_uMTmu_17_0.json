The first statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad\" is a conditional statement, which means it describes a relationship between two events but does not necessarily mean that the second event always occurs when the first event does. The second statement \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad\" indicates that there are situations where Kate did not eat salad even if Ben ate pasta. Therefore, we cannot use this information to infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: no.",
