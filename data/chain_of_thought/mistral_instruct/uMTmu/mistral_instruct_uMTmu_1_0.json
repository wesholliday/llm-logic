This is stated in the question.\n2. However, it's also not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding if Mary was there. This means that it's possible for Mary to have attended the wedding without Sue being present.\n3. Therefore, even though we know that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary must have been there, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding based on the given information because it's possible for Mary to have attended without Sue.\n\nAnswer: No.",
