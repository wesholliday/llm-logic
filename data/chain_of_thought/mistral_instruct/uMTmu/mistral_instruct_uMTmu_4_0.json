It means that if the condition (alien visiting Mars) is true, then the consequence (robot visiting Jupiter) must also be true.\n\nThe next statement given is \"It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter.\" This statement negates the consequence of the conditional statement.\n\nHowever, the given statements do not provide any information about the truth or falsity of the condition itself (alien visiting Mars). Therefore, we cannot infer anything about whether the alien did visit Mars based on the given information alone.\n\nSo, Answer: no, we cannot infer that the alien did not visit Mars based on the given statements.",
