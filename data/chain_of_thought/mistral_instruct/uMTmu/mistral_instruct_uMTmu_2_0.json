It means that if one condition (griffin in the forest) is true, then another condition (unicorn in the forest) must also be true. However, this does not mean that if the unicorn is not in the forest, then the griffin cannot be there. The second statement \"it's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest\" means that the absence of a unicorn in the forest does not imply the absence of a griffin. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no.",
