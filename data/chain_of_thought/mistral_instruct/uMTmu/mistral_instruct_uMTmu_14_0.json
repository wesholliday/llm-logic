It means that if one thing (bear in the cave) is true, then another thing (wolf in the den) must also be true. However, it does not necessarily mean that if the wolf is not in the den, then the bear cannot be in the cave.\n\nThe second part of the statement \"it's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den\" means that the absence of the wolf in the den does not guarantee the absence of the bear in the cave.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: no.",
