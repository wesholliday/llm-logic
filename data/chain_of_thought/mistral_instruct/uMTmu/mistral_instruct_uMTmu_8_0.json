If the vampire is awake, then the mummy is awake (Necessitation).\n2. If the mummy is awake, then the vampire is awake (Sufficiency).\n\nHowever, we are also given that \"it's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\" This statement contradicts the first part of the conditional statement, which implies that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must be awake. Therefore, based on the information provided, it cannot be inferred that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: No.",
