It states that under certain conditions (if the cake is chocolate), there is a consequent (the muffins are blueberry).\n\nHowever, it also mentions that \"it's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\" This means that the muffins could have been something other than blueberry.\n\nTherefore, even though we know that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would have been blueberry, we cannot infer for certain that the cake was not chocolate based on this information alone. There are other possibilities for what the muffins could have been.\n\nAnswer: no.",
