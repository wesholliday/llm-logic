There are four possibilities:\n\n1. Bear is in the cave (true), wolf is in the den (true)\n2. Bear is in the cave (true), wolf is not in the den (false)\n3. Bear is not in the cave (false), wolf is in the den (true)\n4. Bear is not in the cave (false), wolf is not in the den (false)\n\nNow let's analyze each possibility:\n\n1. If both bear and wolf are present in their respective locations, then the original statement and its inverse are both true.\n2. If the bear is in the cave but the wolf is not in the den, then the original statement is false (bear was in the cave, but wolf was not in the den), while the inverse is true (wolf was not in the den, so bear could have been anywhere).\n3. If the wolf is in the den but the bear is not in the cave, then the original statement is false (bear was not in the cave, but wolf was in the den), while the inverse is also true (bear was not in the cave, so it doesn't matter if wolf was in the den or not).\n4. If neither the bear nor the wolf are present in their respective locations, then both the original statement and its inverse are false (neither bear nor wolf were in their caves/dens).\n\nSince the inverse is true under some circumstances where the original statement is false, they are not logically equivalent.\n\nStep 4: Provide the final answer.\n\nAnswer: no.",
