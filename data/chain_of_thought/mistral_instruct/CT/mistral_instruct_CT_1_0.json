If we assume that 'Mary was not at the wedding' is true, then according to the given conditional statement, 'Sue was not at the wedding' must also be true because whenever Mary is not at a wedding, Sue is not there as well. Therefore, the reverse conditional statement follows logically from the given conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
