The statement only tells us that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry. It doesn't provide enough information to make a reverse conclusion.\n\nStep 3: Consider possible scenarios.\n\nLet's consider some possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Both cake and muffins are chocolate and blueberry respectively. In this case, the given statement is true. However, it doesn't imply that if muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\n\nScenario 2: Cake is chocolate, but muffins are not blueberry; instead, they are strawberry. In this case, the given statement is false because the premise (p) is true, but the conclusion (q) is false. Again, it doesn't imply that if muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\n\nStep 4: Conclude based on available information.\n\nBased on the given statement alone, we cannot infer 'If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.' The given statement only establishes a relationship between chocolate cake and blueberry muffins, but it doesn't provide enough information to make a reverse conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no.",
