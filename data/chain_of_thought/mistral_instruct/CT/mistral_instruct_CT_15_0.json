The 'if' part is \"Sam took a plane,\" and the 'then' part is \"Erin took a train.\"\n\nStep 3: Consider the reverse implication.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane,\" we need to consider the reverse implication of the given statement.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the reverse implication.\n\nThe reverse implication is \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\" This means that whenever Erin does not take a train, Sam does not take a plane.\n\nStep 5: Compare the given statement with the reverse implication.\n\nTo determine if we can infer the reverse implication from the given statement, we need to ask ourselves if the two statements are logically equivalent.\n\nStep 6: Determine logical equivalence.\n\nThe given statement and the reverse implication are not logically equivalent because there could be situations where Sam takes a plane without Erin taking a train, and there could also be situations where Erin does not take a train without Sam not taking a plane. For example, Sam might take a plane to go on a business trip while Erin stays home, or they might both decide to drive instead of taking public transportation.\n\nStep 7: Conclusion.\n\nSince the given statement and the reverse implication are not logically equivalent, we cannot infer \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane\" from \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
