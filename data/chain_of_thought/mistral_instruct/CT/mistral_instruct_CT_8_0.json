The reverse statement would be \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine if the reverse statement is true or false based on the information provided.\n\nThe given conditional statement does not state that whenever the mummy is awake, the vampire is also awake. Therefore, we cannot assume that the reverse statement is true based on the information provided.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the implication of the reverse statement being false.\n\nSince the reverse statement is false, it means that there could be instances where the mummy is awake and the vampire is not, or vice versa. This implies that we cannot infer \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake\" based on the given conditional statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
