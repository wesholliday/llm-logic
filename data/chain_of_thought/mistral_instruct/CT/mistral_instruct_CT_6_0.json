It means that whenever Sue chooses pizza, Bob chooses pasta.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the inverse of the given statement.\n\nTo find out if we can infer \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza,\" we need to analyze the inverse of the original statement. The inverse statement is \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine if the inverse statement is true or false based on the given information.\n\nThe inverse statement is not necessarily true based on the given information. For example, it's possible that Sue didn't choose pizza, but Bob still chose pasta (perhaps he ordered it for himself). Therefore, we cannot infer \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no.",
