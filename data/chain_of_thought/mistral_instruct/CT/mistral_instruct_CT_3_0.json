In other words, does the truth of one statement imply the truth of the other?\n\nLet's assume that the book is not a mystery novel. This means that the condition of the inverse statement is true. Now, let's see what we can infer about the author based on this information.\n\nIf the book is not a mystery novel, then it cannot be the case that James wrote it and it is still a mystery novel (since the original conditional statement tells us that if James wrote it, then it must be a mystery novel). Therefore, if the book is not a mystery novel, then James did not write it.\n\nThus, the inverse statement follows logically from the original conditional statement. Therefore, we can infer \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: yes.",
