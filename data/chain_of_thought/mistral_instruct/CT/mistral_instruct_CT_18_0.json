The inverse of \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\"\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of logic.\n\nThe rules of logic state that the converse and inverse of a conditional statement are not necessarily true unless the original statement is a biconditional (if and only if) statement. In this case, we have been given a conditional statement, not a biconditional statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\" is true based on the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
