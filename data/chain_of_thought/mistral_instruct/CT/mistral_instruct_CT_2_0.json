If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest (given statement).\n2. If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest (contrapositive).\n\nThe contrapositive is derived by swapping the hypothesis and the conclusion of the original statement and negating both sides. To check if the given statement implies its contrapositive, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: If the griffin is in the forest, then is the unicorn also in the forest? (Check forward direction)\nAnswer: Yes, according to the given statement.\n\nCase 2: If the unicorn is not in the forest, then is the griffin also not in the forest? (Check reverse direction)\nTo answer this question, let's assume that the unicorn is not in the forest. We want to know if it follows that the griffin is also not in the forest.\n\nIf the unicorn is not in the forest, then according to the given statement, the griffin must be in the forest for the original statement to hold true. However, we assumed that the unicorn is not in the forest, which contradicts our assumption about the griffin being in the forest.\n\nTherefore, if the unicorn is not in the forest, then the griffin cannot be in the forest either (since the given statement does not allow for the unicorn to not be in the forest and the griffin to still be in the forest).\n\nSo, the contrapositive 'If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest' is a valid conclusion from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
