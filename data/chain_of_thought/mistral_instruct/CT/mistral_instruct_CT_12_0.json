To do this, we need to test the truth of each implication in both directions.\n\n1. If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park (contrapositive)\n   - Assume: Lucy did not go to the zoo\n   - Show: Joe did not go to the park\n     - Given: If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\n     - Since Lucy didn't go to the zoo, it follows that Joe didn't go to the park (by the original conditional statement)\n\n2. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo (original)\n   - Assume: Joe went to the park\n   - Show: Lucy went to the zoo\n     - Given: If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\n     - Since Joe went to the park, it follows that Lucy went to the zoo (by the original conditional statement)\n\nSince both implications hold true in both directions, we can conclude that the original conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. Therefore, 'If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park' is a valid inference from 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
