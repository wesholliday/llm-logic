            "content": " To determine if the given conditional statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" allows us to infer \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football,\" we need to consider the relationship between the two statements.\n\nFirst, let's examine the original conditional statement:\n1. If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n\nThis statement implies that whenever Tom watches football, Jen also watches basketball. It does not necessarily mean that they both watch their respective sports at the same time or place.\n\nNow, let's consider the inverse of this statement:\n2. If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\n\nThis statement implies that whenever Jen does not watch basketball, Tom also does not watch football. However, this is not necessarily true based on our original conditional statement. For example, it's possible for both Tom and Jen to watch their preferred sports at different times or places without any correlation between their viewing habits.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nAnswer: no.",
