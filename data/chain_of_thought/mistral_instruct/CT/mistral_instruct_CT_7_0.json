If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n2. If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race (this is the given statement in reverse order).\n3. The negation of the first statement is 'If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race'.\n4. The negation of the second statement is 'If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race' (this is the statement we want to infer).\n5. To determine if we can infer the negation of the given statement from the given statement itself, we need to check if they have the same implication structure.\n6. The implication structures are as follows:\n   - Given statement: Alex finishing the race implies Chris finishing the race.\n   - Statement to be inferred: Chris not finishing the race implies Alex not finishing the race.\n7. Both statements have the same implication structure, which is 'p implies q' and 'not q implies not p'.\n8. Therefore, if we can infer 'If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race' from 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race', it would mean that the given statement is a biconditional statement (p <-> q), which is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n9. However, since the implication structures are the same for both statements, we can infer the negation of the given statement from the given statement if and only if the original statement is a biconditional statement.\n10. Since the given statement is not explicitly stated as a biconditional statement, we cannot assume it to be true without additional information.\n\nAnswer: no.",
