It does not necessarily mean that whenever the cat is outside, the dog is inside. Therefore, it's not safe to make the reverse conclusion based on this statement alone.\n\nStep 3: Consider possible scenarios\n\n1. Scenario where both are inside: There could be situations where both animals are inside the house at the same time. This scenario contradicts the given statement.\n2. Scenario where both are outside: It's also possible for both animals to be outside at the same time, which is not mentioned in the given statement but is a valid possibility.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\n\nBased on the given statement and the reasoning above, we cannot infer 'If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside'.\nAnswer: no.",
