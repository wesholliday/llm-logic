Let's break it down:\n\n1. \"The splat might not be quanked\" - This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the splat has not undergone the process of being 'quanked.' However, it does not necessarily mean that the splat cannot be morphed or that it is not morphed.\n2. \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked\" - This statement presents two alternatives: either the splat has been morphed or it needs to be quanked. It does not specify which of these alternatives is currently true for the given situation.\n\nGiven this information, we cannot definitively infer that \"The splat is morphed.\" While it's possible that the splat could be morphed based on the second statement, the first statement leaves open the possibility that the splat has not been quanked and therefore might not be morphed yet.\n\nAnswer: no.",
