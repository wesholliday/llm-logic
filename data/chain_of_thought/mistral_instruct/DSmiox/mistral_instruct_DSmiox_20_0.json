The first statement is \"The fleeg might not be surned.\" This means that there is a possibility that the fleeg does not need to be shorn (sheared).\n2. The second statement is \"Either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned.\" This statement suggests that if the fleeg is not in a condition that requires shearing (bluttered), then it needs to be shorn instead. However, it does not explicitly state that the fleeg is bluttered when it doesn't need to be shorn.\n\nBased on this analysis, we cannot directly infer \"The fleeg is bluttered\" from the given statements. The second statement only tells us that if the fleeg is not bluttered, then it must be shorn. It does not provide enough information to determine the current state of the fleeg's coat.\n\nAnswer: no.",
