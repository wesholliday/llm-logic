These two statements do not directly contradict each other; they present alternative possibilities for the fate of the dreb.\n\nStep 3: Consider possible scenarios\n1) Scenario where 'The dreb is vroombed': In this case, the dreb would not be spent but instead used in some other way that is referred to as 'vroombing'.\n2) Scenario where 'The dreb is not vroombed and is spent': In this case, the dreb would not be vroombed and would ultimately be spent.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the given statements based on possible scenarios\nBoth scenarios are consistent with the given statements. The first scenario fits with \"The dreb might not be spent\" because the dreb is not being spent in this case, but it's being vroombed instead. The second scenario also fits with \"Either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spent,\" as the dreb is indeed spent in this case.\n\nStep 5: Conclusion\nSince both scenarios are consistent with the given statements, we cannot infer 'The dreb is vroombed' directly from them. However, the given statements do not rule out the possibility of 'The dreb is vroombed'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
