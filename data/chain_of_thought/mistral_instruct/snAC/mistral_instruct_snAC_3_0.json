In other words, could someone else have written the mystery novel?\n\nIf so, then the statements do not logically imply that \"The book was written by James\" is true, and we would answer 'Answer: no'. However, if there's no possibility of anyone else having written the mystery novel except for James, then the statements do logically imply that \"The book was written by James\" is true, and we would answer 'Answer: yes'.\n\nTherefore, to determine the answer, we need more information about the context or specific circumstances surrounding these statements. If it's known or assumed that only James can write mystery novels, then the answer is 'Answer: yes'. Otherwise, the answer is 'Answer: no'.",
