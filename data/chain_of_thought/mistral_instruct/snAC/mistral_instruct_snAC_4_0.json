We have two conditional statements:\n   a) If p (alien visited Mars), then q (robot visited Jupiter).\n   b) q (robot visited Jupiter) is given as a fact.\n\n2. To determine if p (alien visited Mars) is true, we need to apply the rule of Modus Ponens:\n   If p implies q and q is true, then p must be true.\n\n3. In this case, we have p implied by q, and q is given as a fact. Therefore, applying Modus Ponens, we can conclude that p (alien visited Mars) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
