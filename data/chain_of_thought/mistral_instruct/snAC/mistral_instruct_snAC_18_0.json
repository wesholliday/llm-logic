The truck was metal\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given conditions\n\nThe first condition is an if-then statement. It states that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. This means that the two statements are related but do not necessarily mean that they are true at the same time.\n\nThe second condition states that the truck is metal. This is a fact and does not depend on the truth or falsehood of the first condition.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possibilities\n\nThere are three possible scenarios based on the given conditions:\n1. The doll is plastic and the truck is metal (both statements are true)\n2. The doll is not plastic but the truck is metal (the first statement is false, and the second statement is true)\n3. The doll is plastic and the truck is not metal (the first statement is true, but the second statement is false)\n\nStep 4: Determine the answer based on the given conditions\n\nSince we are only given that 'The truck was metal' is true, it does not necessarily follow that 'The doll was plastic'. The if-then statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' could still be false. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no.",
