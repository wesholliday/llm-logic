Given \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis,\" this statement is a conditional statement with the form \"If P, then Q.\"\n2. We are told that \"Amy played tennis,\" which is the consequence (Q) in the conditional statement.\n3. To determine if the condition (P) is true, we need to check if Jeff played basketball.\n4. If we had known that \"Jeff played basketball\" was a fact, then we could conclude that \"Jeff played basketball\" is true based on the given conditional statement and the fact that \"Amy played tennis.\"\n5. However, since we don't know for sure if \"Jeff played basketball,\" we cannot definitively say it's true without more information.\n\nAnswer: no.",
