The conditional statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" means that if Sam takes a plane, Erin will take a train as well. It does not necessarily mean that Erin taking a train causes Sam to take a plane.\n2. We are given that Erin took a train, but we do not have any information about whether Sam took a plane or not.\n3. Therefore, even though it's true that Erin took a train and the conditional statement is also true, it does not necessarily follow that Sam took a plane.\n\nAnswer: No.",
