This statement is saying that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn must also be in the forest. This is a material implication, which means that the truth of the consequent (unicorn being in the forest) follows from the truth of the antecedent (griffin being in the forest).\n\nNext, we have 'The unicorn was in the forest'. Since this statement is true, and the conditional statement implies that if the griffin is in the forest then the unicorn must be there as well, it follows logically that the griffin must also be in the forest.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: yes.",
