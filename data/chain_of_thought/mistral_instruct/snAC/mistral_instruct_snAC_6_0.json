However, it does not necessarily mean that Sue always chooses pizza when Bob chooses pasta.\n\nGiven that we know \"Bob chose pasta\" is true, the conditional statement does not directly imply that \"Sue chose pizza\" is also true. It only implies that if Sue had chosen pizza, then Bob would have chosen pasta.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it's possible for Sue to have chosen something other than pizza.\n\nAnswer: No.",
