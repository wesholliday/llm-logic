A conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is true when either of the following conditions hold:\n\n1. P is false\n2. Both P and Q are true\n\nIn this case, we know that P ('the vampire was awake') and Q ('the mummy was awake') are both true. Therefore, based on the given information, it follows that 'The vampire was awake' is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
