The first statement only suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, while the second statement asserts that Fido must either be in the garden or inside. It does not necessarily follow that if Fido is not in the garden, then he must be inside. There could be other possibilities, such as Fido being at the vet, or out for a walk with his owner.",
