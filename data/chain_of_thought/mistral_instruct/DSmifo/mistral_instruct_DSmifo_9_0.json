The first statement only states that the missing puzzle piece might not be visible on the floor, while the second statement asserts that it must either be on the floor (blending in) or in the box.\n\nStep 3: Consider possible scenarios\n\nIf the missing puzzle piece was indeed blending in on the floor, then it would not have been missed. However, since it has been identified as missing, it cannot be on the floor blending in. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that it is in the box.\n\nStep 4: Infer the answer\n\nAnswer: yes. The given statements do allow for the conclusion that 'The missing puzzle piece is in the box'.",
