However, Statement 1 tells us that the book might not be on the table. This means that there is a possibility that the book is actually on the shelf.\n\nStep 3: Consider all possible scenarios\n\nIf the book were on the table, then both statements would be false because Statement 1 would be false (since the book is indeed on the table), and Statement 2 would be false (because there are more than two possibilities - the book could be on the table or on the shelf).\n\nHowever, if the book is on the shelf, then both statements are true. Statement 1 is true because the book is not on the table, and Statement 2 is true because the book is indeed either on the table (which is false) or on the shelf (which is true).\n\nStep 4: Conclude based on available information\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, it cannot be definitively concluded that 'The book is on the shelf' with certainty. However, we can infer that it is a possibility based on Statement 1 and the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nAnswer: yes (it is a possibility) but not a certainty.",
