We have two statements: 'The watch might not be on his wrist' and 'Either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser'.\n2. The first statement implies that there is a possibility that the watch is not on his wrist, but it does not necessarily mean that the watch is charging.\n3. The second statement states that if the watch is not on his wrist, then it must be charging on the dresser. However, this statement does not provide any information about the current state of the watch. It only tells us what would be the case if the watch is not on his wrist.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that 'The watch is charging on the dresker'. We can only say that if the watch is not on his wrist, then it could be charging on the dresser.",
