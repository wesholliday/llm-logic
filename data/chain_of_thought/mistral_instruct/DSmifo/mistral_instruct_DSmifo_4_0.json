This means that both possibilities are valid according to this statement.\n\nStep 3: Consider the relationship between the statements\n\nSince Statement 1 does not necessarily contradict Statement 2 (as the cat could be napping on the couch instead of playing in the bedroom), we cannot infer 'The cat is napping on the couch' directly from these two statements alone.\n\nStep 4: Conclude based on given information\n\nAnswer: No.",
