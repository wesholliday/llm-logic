The first statement only suggests that the jacket might not be hanging in the closet, while the second statement states that the jacket must be hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair. However, we cannot be certain that the jacket is not hanging in the closet and draped over the chair at the same time, so we cannot infer that it is only draped over the chair based on these statements alone.",
