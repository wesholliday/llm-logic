In this case, the two parts are \"the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet\" and \"it is in the car.\"\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of Statement 1\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the umbrella might not be in the closet. This means that it could be anywhere except for the closet.\n\nStep 4: Determine if Statement 2 provides any new information\n\nSince Statement 2 is an either-or statement, and Statement 1 tells us that the umbrella might not be in the closet (which implies that it could be in the car), then Statement 2 does provide new information. It tells us that if the umbrella is not in the closet, then it must be in the car.\n\nStep 5: Infer the answer based on the given statements\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that 'The umbrella is in the car'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
