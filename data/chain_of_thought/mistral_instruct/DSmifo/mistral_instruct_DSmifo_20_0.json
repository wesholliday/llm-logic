In this case, the alternatives are \"the sunglasses are perched on her head\" and \"the sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of each alternative\n\nIf the first alternative, \"the sunglasses are perched on her head,\" is true, then the second statement would be false because both alternatives cannot be true at the same time. Therefore, if the sunglasses are indeed on her head, we cannot infer that they are in her bag based on the given information.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the remaining alternative\n\nIf the first alternative is false, then the second alternative must be true. In this case, \"the sunglasses are in her bag\" would be the only possible conclusion that can be drawn from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes (if the sunglasses are not on her head, then they must be in her bag)",
