The first alternative is that the milk is chilling in the fridge, and the second alternative is that it is on the counter. Since these are mutually exclusive, if one alternative is not true, then the other must be true.\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of each statement\n\nStatement 1 suggests that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge, but it does not definitively state that it is on the counter. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that the milk is on the counter based on Statement 1 alone.\n\nStep 4: Use the logical relationship between the statements to make a conclusion\n\nSince Statement 2 states that either the milk is chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter, and Statement 1 suggests that it might not be chilling in the fridge, we can infer that the milk must be on the counter based on Statement 2.\n\nAnswer: yes",
