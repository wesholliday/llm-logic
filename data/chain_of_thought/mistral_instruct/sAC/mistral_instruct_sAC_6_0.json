We know that \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the first part (Sue choosing pizza) is true, then the second part (Bob choosing pasta) must be true.\n2. We also know that \"Bob chose pasta\" is a fact.\n3. However, the truth of \"Bob chose pasta\" does not necessarily mean that \"Sue chose pizza\" is true. It only means that if Sue had chosen pizza, then Bob would have chosen pasta. But we don't know for sure that Sue chose pizza.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that \"Sue chose pizza\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no.",
