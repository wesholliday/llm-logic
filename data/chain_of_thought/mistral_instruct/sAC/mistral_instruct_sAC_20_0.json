We have two conditional statements:\n   a) If the apple is red, then the banana is yellow. (P -> Q)\n   b) The banana is yellow. (Q)\n\n2. To determine if P (the apple being red) is true, we can use the method of contradiction or the method of consequence. Since the question asks for a direct answer, we will use the method of consequence.\n\n3. We know that Q (banana being yellow) is true. According to the given conditional statement P ->Q, if P were false, then Q would be false, which contradicts our current knowledge. Therefore, P must be true.\n\n4. So, to answer the question:\n   Answer: yes. The apple was red.",
