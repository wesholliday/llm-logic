Modus Ponens: If P -> Q is true and P is true, then Q must also be true.\n\nGiven our statements, P is \"Jeff plays basketball\" (which we don't know yet) and Q is \"Amy plays tennis,\" which is true. To apply modus ponens, we need to determine if P->Q is true.\n\n2. Given the statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis,\" we already know that P->Q is true.\n\nTherefore, since both P->Q and Q are true, by applying modus ponens, it follows that P (Jeff plays basketball) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
