We know that \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is true. This means that whenever the condition (the book being written by James) is true, the consequence (the book being a mystery novel) must also be true.\n2. We also know that \"The book is a mystery novel\" is true.\n3. To determine if \"The book was written by James\" is true, we need to check if the condition (James being the author) could have been the cause of the consequence (the book being a mystery novel).\n4. Since we know that the consequence (the book being a mystery novel) is already true, and given that the implication \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" tells us that whenever James writes a book, it will be a mystery novel, we can conclude that:\n5. The condition (James being the author) must have been the cause of the consequence (the book being a mystery novel).\n6. Therefore, \"The book was written by James\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
