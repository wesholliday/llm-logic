We know that \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is true.\n2. The conditional statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" also holds true.\n3. To test if \"Joe went to the park\" is true, we need to check if Lucy went to the zoo when Joe indeed went to the park.\n4. Since the conditional statement is a biconditional (meaning it implies both 'if p then q' and 'if q then p'), for the statement to be true, both 'p -> q' and 'q -> p' must hold.\n5. We have already established that 'Lucy went to the zoo' (q) is true when 'Joe went to the park' (p) is assumed to be true.\n6. Now we need to check if 'Joe went to the park' (p) is true when 'Lucy went to the zoo' (q) is given.\n7. Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to determine that directly from the given statements.\n8. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot definitively say whether \"Joe went to the park\" is true or not.\n\nAnswer: The question cannot be answered with the given information.",
