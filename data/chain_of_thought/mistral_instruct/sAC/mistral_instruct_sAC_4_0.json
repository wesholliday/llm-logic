We are given two statements:\n   a) If p (alien visited Mars), then q (robot visited Jupiter).\n   b) q (robot visited Jupiter) is true.\n\n2. To determine if p (alien visited Mars) is true, we can use the rule of Modus Ponens:\n   If p implies q and q is true, then p must be true.\n\n3. Applying this rule to our given statements:\n   Since q (robot visited Jupiter) is true and if p (alien visited Mars) then q, it follows that p (alien visited Mars) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
