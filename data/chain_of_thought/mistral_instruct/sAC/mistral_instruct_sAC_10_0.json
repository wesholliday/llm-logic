We know that \"The cat was outside\" is true.\n2. From the given conditional statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside,\" we can infer that if the cat was outside, then the dog cannot be inside.\n3. Therefore, based on the information provided, it follows that \"The dog was inside\" is not true.\n\nAnswer: no.",
