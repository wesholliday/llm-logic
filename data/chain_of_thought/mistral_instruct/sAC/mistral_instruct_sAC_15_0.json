This is a biconditional relationship, meaning it goes both ways: if Sam takes a plane, then Erin takes a train, and if Erin takes a train, then Sam took a plane.\n\nGiven that 'Erin took a train' is true, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that 'Sam took a plane' must also be true. This is because the truth of 'Erin took a train' implies the truth of 'Sam took a plane', according to the biconditional relationship stated in the conditional statement.\n\nSo, the answer is:\nAnswer: yes.",
