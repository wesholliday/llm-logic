We know that \"Jen watched basketball\" is true.\n2. The conditional statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" tells us that if Tom watches football, then Jen will watch basketball.\n3. To determine if Tom watched football, we need to check if there's any information given that satisfies the 'if' part of the conditional statement. In this case, we don't have any direct evidence that Tom watched football.\n4. Since we cannot definitively say that Tom watched football based on the given information, it would be incorrect to assume that \"Tom watched football\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no.",
