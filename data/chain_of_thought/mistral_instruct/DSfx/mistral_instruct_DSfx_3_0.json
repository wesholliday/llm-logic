We have two statements: \"Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed\" and \"The splat is not quanked.\"\n2. The first statement tells us that there are only two possibilities for the state of the splat: either it is quanked or it is morphed.\n3. The second statement tells us that the splat is not in the quanked state.\n4. Since we know that the splat cannot be quanked, and we also know that there are only two possibilities for the state of the splat (quanked or morphed), then it must be in the morphed state.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The splat is morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes.",
