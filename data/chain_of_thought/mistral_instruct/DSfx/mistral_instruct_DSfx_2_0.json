(This is a disjunction, meaning it can be either one or the other, but not both at the same time.)\nStatement 2: The wug is not bimmed.\n\nStep 2: Eliminate possibilities based on given information\nSince Statement 2 tells us that the wug is not bimmed, we know for sure that the first part of Statement 1 (\"The wug is bimmed\") cannot be true. Therefore, by process of elimination, the second part of Statement 1 must be true: \"The wug is flooped.\"\n\nAnswer: yes.",
