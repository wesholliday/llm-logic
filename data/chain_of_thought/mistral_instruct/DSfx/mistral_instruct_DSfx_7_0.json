We have two statements: \"Either the whiffle is tinked or it is shanked\" and \"The whiffle is not tinked.\"\n2. The first statement tells us that the whiffle can be either tinked or shanked, but it doesn't specify which one is true.\n3. The second statement tells us that the whiffle is not tinked.\n4. However, the second statement does not contradict the first statement because the first statement allows for both possibilities (tinked or shanked) and the second statement only negates one of those possibilities (not tinked).\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The whiffle is shanked\" based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
