Therefore, Statement 1 cannot be true if Statement 2 is true.\n\nStep 3: Conclusion\n\nSince Statement 2 (The sprocket is not daggled) contradicts Statement 1 (Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked), and Statement 2 is a fact, Statement 1 must be false. As a result, we cannot infer 'The sprocket is cranked' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no.",
