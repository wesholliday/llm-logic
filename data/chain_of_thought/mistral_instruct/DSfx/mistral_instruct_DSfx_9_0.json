We have two statements: \"Either the twonk is varnished or it is plinked\" and \"The twonk is not plinked.\"\n2. From these two statements, we cannot directly infer that \"The twonk is varnished,\" because there's a possibility that the twonk could be neither varnished nor plinked (since one of the two possibilities has been ruled out).\n3. To make a definitive conclusion, we would need an additional piece of information that eliminates the possibility of \"The twonk\" being neither varnished nor plinked.\n4. Without such additional information, we cannot infer that \"The twonk is varnished.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
