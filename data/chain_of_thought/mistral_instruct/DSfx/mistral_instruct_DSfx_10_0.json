This means that the wug can be in one of two states - either garpled or sproinged, but not both at the same time.\n\nStep 3: The second statement is 'The wug is not garpled.' This tells us that the wug is not in the garpled state.\n\nStep 4: Since we know that the wug can only be in one of two states (garpled or sproinged), and we have been told that it is not in the garpled state, then by process of elimination, it must be in the sproinged state.\n\nAnswer: yes",
