'Either the grommet is plopped or it is sploffed' means that one of these two statements must be true, while the other must be false.\n2. 'The grommet is not plopped' states that the grommet is not plopped, which contradicts the statement 'the grommet is plopped'.\n3. Since a contradiction implies that both statements cannot be true at the same time, it follows that 'the grommet is sploffed' must be the true statement (as the other one is false).\n4. Answer: yes.",
