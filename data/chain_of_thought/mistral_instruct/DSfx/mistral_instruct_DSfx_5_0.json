We have two statements: \"Either the zinger is smoogled or it is fraggled\" and \"The zinger is not smoogled.\"\n2. The first statement tells us that the zinger cannot be in a state of being neither smoogled nor fraggled, as those are the only two options given.\n3. The second statement tells us that the zinger is not smoogled.\n4. To infer that \"The zinger is fraggled,\" we would need to know that there is no other possibility for the state of the zinger besides being smoogled or fraggled, and that it cannot be smoogled based on the given information.\n5. However, we don't have enough information to definitively conclude that \"The zinger is fraggled.\" It could still be in a state other than smoogled or fraggled, but we just don't know what that might be.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: no.",
