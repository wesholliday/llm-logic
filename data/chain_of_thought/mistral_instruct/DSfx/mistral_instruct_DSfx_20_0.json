We have two statements: \"Either the fleeg is surned or it is bluttered\" and \"The fleeg is not surned.\"\n2. Let's first consider what \"Either the fleeg is surned or it is bluttered\" means. This statement is saying that one of these two things must be true: either the fleeg is surned (covered), or it is bluttered (spotted or stained).\n3. Now, we know that \"The fleeg is not surned.\" This means that the fleeg cannot be covered.\n4. Given this information, let's see if we can infer that the fleeg must be bluttered instead. If the fleeg cannot be covered (surned), then it must be bluttered according to the first statement.\n5. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The fleeg is bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
