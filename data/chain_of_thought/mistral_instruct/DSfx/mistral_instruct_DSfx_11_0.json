We have two statements: \"Either the flug is zimmed or it is blummed\" and \"The flug is not zimmed.\"\n2. The first statement tells us that the flug must be either zimmed or blummed, but we don't know which one is true.\n3. The second statement tells us that the flug is not zimmed.\n4. To determine if the flug is blummed based on these two statements, let's consider the possibilities:\n   a) If the flug were zimmed, then according to the first statement, it would have to be zimmed and we wouldn't be able to say that it's not zimmed (as stated in the second statement). Therefore, the flug cannot be zimmed.\n   b) Since the flug is not zimmed, then according to the first statement, it must be blummed.\n5. So, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The flug is blummed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
