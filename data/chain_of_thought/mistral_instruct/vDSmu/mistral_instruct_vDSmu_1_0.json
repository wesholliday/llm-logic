            "content": " To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to check if its conclusion follows necessarily from its premises. Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. Premise 1: Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\n2. Premise 2: It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n3. Conclusion: Fido is inside.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each premise and conclusion mean:\n\n1. Premise 1: This premise states that there are only two possibilities for Fido's location - either he is inside or he must be in the garden.\n2. Premise 2: This premise denies the second possibility stated in Premise 1, i.e., Fido cannot be in the garden.\n3. Conclusion: The conclusion asserts that Fido is inside based on the given premises.\n\nNow let's check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises:\n\nSince Premise 2 denies the second possibility stated in Premise 1, it implies that Fido must be inside (the first possibility). Therefore, the conclusion 'Fido is inside' follows logically from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
