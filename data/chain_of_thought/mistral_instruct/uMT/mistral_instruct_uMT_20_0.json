We are given two pieces of information: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow,\" and \"The banana was not yellow.\"\n2. From the first piece of information, we can infer that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow. This is a conditional statement.\n3. However, from the second piece of information, we know that the banana is not yellow.\n4. Since the banana cannot be yellow according to the second piece of information, and the first piece of information states that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow, it follows that the apple cannot be red.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
