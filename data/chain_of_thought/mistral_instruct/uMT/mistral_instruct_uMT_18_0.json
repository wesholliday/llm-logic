The truck was not metal.\n\nTo infer if the doll is plastic or not based on these statements, let's reason through them:\n\n1. According to the first statement, if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal.\n2. However, we know from the second statement that the truck is not metal.\n3. Since both conditions of the first statement cannot hold true at the same time (plastic doll and metal truck), it means that the initial assumption (if the doll was plastic) leads to a contradiction.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, the doll cannot be plastic.\n\nAnswer: no. (The doll is not plastic.)",
