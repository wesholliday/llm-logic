However, we also know that the muffins were not blueberry.\n3. From point 2, we can infer that the muffins were something other than blueberry.\n4. Since we don't have any information about what the muffins actually were, we cannot determine for sure if the cake was chocolate or not based on this information alone.\n5. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive answer based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: I cannot determine yes or no with the given information.",
