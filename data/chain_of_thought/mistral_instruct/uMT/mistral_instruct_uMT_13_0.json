            "content": " This is a classic example of a contradiction. Let's break it down:\n\n1. If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n2. The truck was not blue.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. But from statement 2, we know that the truck is not blue. This creates a contradiction because both statements cannot be true at the same time.\n\nTo resolve this contradiction, we need to find which statement is false. Let's test each statement:\n\n1. If the car was red, then the truck was blue. (This statement is conditional and depends on the truth of the first part - that the car is red.)\n2. The truck was not blue. (This statement is unconditional and asserts a fact about the truck's color.)\n\nSince we know that the truck cannot be both blue and not blue at the same time, the second statement must be false. Therefore, the truck being not blue contradicts the first statement that if the car was red, then the truck would be blue.\n\nTo maintain consistency in our reasoning, we must conclude that the first statement (if the car was red, then the truck was blue) is also false because its truth depends on a false premise (the truck being blue).\n\nGiven this analysis, it follows that if the car was red and the truck was not blue, then the car cannot be red. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes.",
