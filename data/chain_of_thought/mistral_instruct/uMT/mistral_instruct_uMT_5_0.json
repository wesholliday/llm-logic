            "content": " Step 1: We are given two statements:\n\nStatement 1: If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\nStatement 2: Amy did not play tennis.\n\nStep 2: Let's analyze each statement separately:\n\nStatement 1: This is a conditional statement with an \"if\" clause and a consequent. It tells us that if Jeff plays basketball, then Amy plays tennis. But it does not tell us anything about what happens when Amy doesn't play tennis or when Jeff doesn't play basketball.\n\nStatement 2: This statement tells us that Amy did not play tennis.\n\nStep 3: Let's consider the possible scenarios based on these statements:\n\nScenario A: Jeff plays basketball, so Amy plays tennis (according to Statement 1). But we know from Statement 2 that Amy didn't play tennis. This creates a contradiction.\n\nScenario B: Jeff doesn't play basketball, so it is unknown whether Amy plays tennis or not (since Statement 1 only tells us about the relationship between their basketball and tennis activities when Jeff plays basketball).\n\nStep 4: Based on the given information, we cannot definitively infer that Jeff didn't play basketball. The statements do not provide enough evidence to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No.",
