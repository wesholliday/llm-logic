If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel (this is statement 1).\n2. The book was written by James (this is statement 2).\n3. To find out if we can infer that \"The book is a mystery novel,\" we need to use logical reasoning:\n   - Since statement 2 tells us that the book was indeed written by James, we can substitute this into statement 1 and conclude that the book must be a mystery novel.\n4. Therefore, the answer is 'Answer: yes'.",
