If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest (conditional statement).\n2. The griffin was in the forest (fact).\n\nNow, to use the given information to infer that \"the unicorn was in the forest,\" we need to apply the rules of logic for conditional statements:\n\n1. Given a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and a fact \"P is true,\" we can infer that \"Q is true.\"\n\nIn our case, P represents \"the griffin is in the forest,\" and Q represents \"the unicorn is in the forest.\" Based on the given information, we have both P (griffin in the forest) and the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" (if griffin, then unicorn). Therefore, according to the rules of logic for conditional statements, we can infer that Q (unicorn in the forest) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
