In this case, if the car is red, then the truck is blue.\n2. \"The car was red\": This statement indicates that the car's color is indeed red.\n\nNow let's consider if we can infer that the truck is blue based on these statements:\n\nGiven the conditional statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue,\" and the fact that \"The car was red,\" we can infer that the truck must be blue according to the condition stated. Therefore, the answer is 'Answer: yes'.",
