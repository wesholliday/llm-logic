In this case, if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry. However, Statement 2 only tells us that the cake is chocolate, but it does not provide any information about the muffins.\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of each statement\n\nStatement 1 implies that if we know the cake is chocolate, then we can infer that the muffins are blueberry. However, Statement 2 only tells us about the cake and does not give us enough information to make a definitive conclusion about the muffins.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the logical validity of the inference\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot infer that the muffins were blueberry. While Statement 1 suggests that this is the case if the cake is chocolate, Statement 2 only tells us that the cake is chocolate and does not provide any information about the muffins. Therefore, the inference from Statement 1 and Statement 2 to 'The muffins were blueberry' is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no.",
