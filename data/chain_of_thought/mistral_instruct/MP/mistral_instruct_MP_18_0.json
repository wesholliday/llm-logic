It implies that if the condition (doll being plastic) is true, then the consequence (truck being metal) must also be true.\n2. \"The doll was plastic\": This statement is a fact, indicating that the doll is made of plastic material.\n\nNow let's consider if we can infer that the truck is metal based on this information:\n\nTo make an inference, we need to apply the given conditional statement to the known facts. In this case, we have the condition (doll being plastic) and want to determine if the consequence (truck being metal) follows. Since the condition is true (the doll is plastic), according to the conditional statement, the consequence must also be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The truck was metal.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
