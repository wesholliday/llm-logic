            "content": " To determine if we can infer that \"The banana was yellow\" from \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" and \"The apple was red,\" let's break down each statement:\n\n1. \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\": This is a conditional statement, meaning it describes a relationship between two events or propositions. In this case, if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow.\n2. \"The apple was red\": This is a factual statement that the apple is indeed red.\n\nNow let's consider if we can infer that \"The banana was yellow\" based on these two statements:\n\nTo make this inference, we need to apply the logical rule of Modus Ponens (MP), which states that if we have a conditional statement \"If p, then q\" and a factual statement \"p,\" we can infer \"q.\" In our case, p is \"the apple was red\" and q is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\nSo, to apply Modus Ponens:\n1. If p (apple is red), then q (banana is yellow)\n2. p (apple is red)\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The banana was yellow.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
