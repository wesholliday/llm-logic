Here's why:\n\nThe first premise states that if Sue chooses pizza, then Bob chooses pasta. This is a conditional statement.\n\nThe second premise states that Bob chose pasta.\n\nHowever, the conclusion states that Sue chose pizza. But just because Bob chose pasta does not mean that Sue chose pizza. The premises do not provide enough information to logically deduce that Sue chose pizza. Therefore, the argument is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no.",
