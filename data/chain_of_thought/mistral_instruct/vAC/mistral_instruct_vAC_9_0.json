            "content": " This argument form is called Modus ponens in logic. The rule for Modus ponens states that if we have two statements, P implies Q and P is true, then Q must be true.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt (P implies Q)\n2. Mark bought the blue shirt (P)\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid using Modus ponens, we need to check if P implies Q and P are both true. In this case, P implies Q is given as a premise, and P is stated as the second premise. Since both conditions are met, the conclusion 'Lisa bought the red shirt' (Q) must be true according to Modus ponens.\n\nAnswer: yes",
