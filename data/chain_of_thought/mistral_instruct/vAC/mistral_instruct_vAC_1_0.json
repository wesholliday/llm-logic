            "content": " To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nLet's analyze the given argument step by step:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (Premise 1)\n2. Sue was at the wedding (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Mary was at the wedding (Conclusion)\n\nTo check if this argument is valid, we need to apply the rules of logic to it. Specifically, we can use the rule of Modus Ponens, which states that if we have two statements: A -> B and A, then we can infer B.\n\nIn our case, we have:\n- A -> B: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (Premise 1)\n- A: Sue was at the wedding (Premise 2)\n\nSince Premises 1 and 2 satisfy the conditions of Modus Ponens, we can infer that Mary was at the wedding as the conclusion. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
