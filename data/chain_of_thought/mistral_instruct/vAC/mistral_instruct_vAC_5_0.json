            "content": " To determine the logical validity of an argument, we need to check if a true premise guarantees a true conclusion. In this case, the argument is:\n\n1. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. (Premise 1)\n2. Amy played tennis. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Jeff played basketball. (Conclusion)\n\nThis form of argument is called a conditional proof or modus ponens. To check its validity, we need to see if the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nFirst, let's assume that both premises are true:\n1. Jeff did not play basketball (assumption for contradiction)\n2. Amy played tennis (given as Premise 2)\n\nSince Premise 1 states that \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis,\" we can infer that if Jeff didn't play basketball, then Amy must not have played tennis to maintain the truth of the conditional statement. However, we know that Amy did play tennis (Premise 2), which creates a contradiction with our assumption that Jeff didn't play basketball.\n\nSince our assumption led to a contradiction, it means that our original premises cannot both be true if the conclusion is false. Therefore, for this argument to be valid, the conclusion must be true whenever the premises are true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
