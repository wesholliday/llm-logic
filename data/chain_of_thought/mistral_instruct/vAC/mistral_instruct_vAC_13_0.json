Here's why:\n\nThe first premise states that if the car is red, then the truck is blue. The second premise states that the truck is blue. However, the conclusion states that the car is red. But we cannot infer that the car is red based on the given premises alone. In order for the argument to be logically valid, we would need an additional premise stating that the car is red if the truck is blue. Without this premise, the argument does not follow logically.\n\nAnswer: no.",
