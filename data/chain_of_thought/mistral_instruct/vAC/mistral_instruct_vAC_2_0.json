The argument can be represented as follows using propositional logic:\n\nP1. If A then B\nP2. A\nC. B\n\nHere, A represents 'the griffin was in the forest' and B represents 'the unicorn was in the forest'.\n\nTo check for logical validity, we can use a truth table:\n\n| A | B |\n|---|---|\n| T | T |\n| T | F |\n| F | T |\n| F | F |\n\nSince all rows of the truth table have a 'T' in the third column (B), which corresponds to the conclusion, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
