            "content": " To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad (Premise 1)\n2. Kate ate salad (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Ben ate pasta (Conclusion)\n\nThe given argument is called a contrapositive argument. To check its validity, we need to see if the conclusion can be derived from the premises using the rules of logic. In this case, the contrapositive of Premise 1 is: \"If Kate didn't eat salad, then Ben didn't eat pasta.\"\n\nNow let's assume that Premise 2 is true (Kate ate salad). Since Premise 1 states that \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad,\" this means that if we know that Kate ate salad, it follows logically that Ben must have eaten pasta according to the given information.\n\nTherefore, the argument is valid because the conclusion (Ben ate pasta) follows necessarily from the premises (Ben ate pasta only if Kate ate salad, and Kate ate salad).\n\nAnswer: yes",
