However, we cannot determine the validity of the argument based on a false premise alone.\n   b. If premise 1 is true and premise 2 is also true (unicorns are in the forest when griffins are), then it could be possible for both statements to be true, meaning that the conclusion (griffin being in the forest) might be true as well.
