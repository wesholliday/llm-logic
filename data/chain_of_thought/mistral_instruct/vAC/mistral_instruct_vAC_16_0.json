Here's why:\n\nThe first premise states that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim. The second premise states that the pants are denim. However, the conclusion jumps to stating that the shirt is cotton, which is not logically implied by the given premises. It's possible for both the shirt and pants to be made of denim or cotton separately. Therefore, having the information that the pants are denim does not guarantee that the shirt is cotton.\n\nAnswer: no.",
