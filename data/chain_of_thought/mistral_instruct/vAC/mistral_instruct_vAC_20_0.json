Here's why:\n\nThe first premise states that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow. The second premise states that the banana is yellow. However, the conclusion states that the apple is red. But we cannot infer that the apple is red based on the given premises alone. The premises only establish a conditional relationship between the colors of the apple and the banana, not that the apple must be red when the banana is yellow. Therefore, the argument does not follow logically from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no.",
