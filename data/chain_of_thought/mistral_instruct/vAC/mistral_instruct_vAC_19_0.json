If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n2. Jen watched basketball.\n3. Therefore, Tom watched football.\n\nThis form of argument is called a modus ponens argument, which is valid if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. However, in this case, the premises do not guarantee that Tom watched football. The second premise only tells us that Jen watched basketball, but it does not necessarily mean that Tom watched football when the first premise states that \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no.",
