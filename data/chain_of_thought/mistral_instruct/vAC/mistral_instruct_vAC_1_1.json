In other words, Mary's presence implies Sue's presence.\n\nSecond Premise: Sue was at the wedding.\nThis premise states that Sue attended the wedding.\n\nThird Part (Conclusion): Therefore, Mary was at the wedding.\nTo determine if this conclusion logically follows from the premises, we need to check if Sue being at the wedding implies that Mary must also have been there. Unfortunately, from the given information, there's no definitive way to know that for sure. For example, it's possible (but not guaranteed) that both Mary and Sue attended the wedding. However, their attendance could also be mutually exclusive\u2014meaning one could attend without the other. Without knowing more about the situation or having additional information, we cannot definitively say whether this argument is logically valid or not.\n\nSince we cannot make a definitive conclusion based on the given premises alone, the answer is: Answer: no.
