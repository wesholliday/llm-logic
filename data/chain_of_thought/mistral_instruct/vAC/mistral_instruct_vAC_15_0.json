If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n2. Erin took a train.\n3. Therefore, Sam took a plane.\n\nThis argument form is known as modus ponens and is logically valid if the premises are true. However, in this case, we cannot determine the truth of the premises without additional information. The first premise is a conditional statement, which means it consists of two parts: the antecedent (Sam took a plane) and the consequent (Erin took a train). For the argument to be valid, both parts must be true whenever the antecedent is true.\n\nSince we do not have enough information to determine the truth or falsehood of the premises, we cannot definitively say whether this argument form is logically valid or not based on the given premises alone. We would need to know whether Sam took a plane and whether Erin took a train for that determination.\n\nAnswer: It is impossible to determine yes or no with the given information.",
