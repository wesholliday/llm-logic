Here's why:\n\nThe argument can be represented in symbolic logic as follows:\n\nIf P (the book was written by James), then Q (the book is a mystery novel)\nQ (the book is a mystery novel)\nTherefore, P (the book was written by James)\n\nHowever, just because Q follows from P does not mean that P follows from Q. In other words, just because the book being a mystery novel follows from it being written by James, it doesn't necessarily mean that it being written by James follows from it being a mystery novel. There could be other possible explanations for why the book is a mystery novel besides it being written by James.\n\nAnswer: no.",
