Here's why:\n\nThe first premise states that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. This is a conditional statement.\n\nThe second premise states that the truck is metal.\n\nHowever, the conclusion states that the doll is plastic. But there is no information given in the premises that would allow us to infer that the doll is plastic based on the fact that the truck is metal. Therefore, the argument does not follow logically from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no.",
