In other words, does the truth of the premise guarantee the truth of the conclusion?\n\nLet's break down the components of the argument:\n\n1. Premise: If I study hard, I will pass the test.\n2. Conclusion: If I study hard and the test is in Chinese, I will pass the test.\n\nThe premise states that studying hard leads to passing the test. The conclusion adds an additional condition that the test is in Chinese. However, the premise does not make any assumptions about the language of the test. Therefore, the conclusion goes beyond what is stated in the premise.\n\nAnswer: no.",
