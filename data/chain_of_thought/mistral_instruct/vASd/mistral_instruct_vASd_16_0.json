This statement assumes that there are no other factors affecting the lawn's growth, such as weather conditions.\n\nThe conclusion, however, introduces a new condition - a drought. The argument does not provide any information about how the drought would affect the lawn's response to fertilization. It is possible that the drought could prevent the lawn from becoming lush and green despite being fertilized. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no.",
