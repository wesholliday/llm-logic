In other words, does the truth of the premise guarantee the truth of the conclusion?\n\nLet's break down the components of the argument:\n\n1. Premise: If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired.\n2. Conclusion: If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired.\n\nThe conclusion is an extension of the premise, but it doesn't follow logically that doing hard labor, in addition to getting enough sleep, will not make someone tired. While getting enough sleep may help reduce tiredness, it does not eliminate the potential for fatigue when performing hard labor.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no.",
