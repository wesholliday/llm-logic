We have two statements:\n   a) Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked\n   b) It's not the case that the splat must be quanked\n\n2. Let's analyze each statement:\n   a) This statement tells us that there are only two possibilities for the splat - it can either be morphed or it must be quanked.\n   b) This statement tells us that the second possibility (the splat must be quanked) is not true.\n\n3. Now, let's use logical reasoning to determine if we can infer 'The splat is morphed':\n   - Since we know that there are only two possibilities for the splat and one of them has been ruled out, then the remaining possibility must be true.\n   - Therefore, since it's not the case that the splat must be quanked, it follows logically that 'The splat is morphed'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
