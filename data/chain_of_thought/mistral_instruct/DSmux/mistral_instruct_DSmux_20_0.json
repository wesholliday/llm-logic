If the fleeg is bluttered (wet and dirty), then it does not need to be surned (dried). Conversely, if the fleeg must be surned, then it cannot be bluttered because a wet fleeg would not need to be dried.\n2. \"It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned\": This statement means that the fleeg does not have to be dried.\n3. To infer \"The fleeg is bluttered,\" we would need to know that it cannot be dried, which contradicts the given information. Since both statements are true, and neither implies the negation of the other, we cannot directly infer \"The fleeg is bluttered\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no.",
