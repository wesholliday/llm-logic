(Statement 1)\n2. It's not the case that the shank must be nugged. (Statement 2)\n\nFirst, we need to understand what \"plooked\" and \"nugged\" mean in this context. Let's assume they represent two different conditions or actions for the shank.\n\nNow let's analyze the given statements:\n\n1. Statement 1 tells us that there are only two possibilities for the shank \u2013 it can be plooked, or it must be nugged.\n2. Statement 2 informs us that the second possibility (the shank must be nugged) is not true.\n\nSince we know that both \"plooked\" and \"nugged\" are distinct possibilities for the shank, and we have been told that the second possibility (it must be nugged) is not true \u2013 it follows logically that the first possibility (the shank is plooked) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
