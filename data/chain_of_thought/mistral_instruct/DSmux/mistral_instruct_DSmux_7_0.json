(This statement presents two mutually exclusive options.)\n2. It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked. (This statement negates the second option from the first statement, meaning the whiffle cannot be tinked.)\n\nNow let's consider what we can infer:\n\nSince the second statement negates the option \"the whiffle must be tinked,\" it follows that the only remaining option is \"the whiffle is shanked.\" Therefore, based on the given statements, we can infer \"The whiffle is shanked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes.",
