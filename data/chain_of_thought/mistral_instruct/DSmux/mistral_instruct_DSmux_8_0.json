It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what \"It's not the case that\" means in logic. It negates the statement that follows it. So, the second statement is equivalent to \"The sprocket is not daggled.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the first statement: \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled.\" This statement can be read as two separate statements:\n\n1. The sprocket is cranked.\n2. The sprocket must be daggled.\n\nSince we know that the second statement is not true, we can eliminate it as an option. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that \"The sprocket is cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes.",
