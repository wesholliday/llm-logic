(Let's call this statement A.)\n2. It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled. (Let's call this statement B.)\n\nFirst, let's understand what each statement means:\n- Statement A: This statement sets up a disjunction (either/or situation). It suggests that there are only two possibilities for the state of the flugel: it can be blimmed or it must be zargled.\n- Statement B: This statement negates statement C, which is implied but not explicitly stated in the given statements. Since we don't have statement C, let's assume that \"it must be zargled\" means the same as \"the flugel cannot be blimmed.\" Therefore, statement B says that it's not the case that the flugel cannot be blimmed.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationship between statements A and B:\n- Statement A suggests that there are only two possibilities for the state of the flugel.\n- Statement B tells us that one of those possibilities (the flugel not being blimmed) is not the case.\n\nSince statement B tells us that it's not the case that the flugel cannot be blimmed, it follows that the flugel can indeed be blimmed. Therefore, statement A (\"either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled\") is true when we interpret \"it must be zargled\" as meaning \"cannot be blimmed.\" Since statement B tells us that this interpretation is incorrect, and the flugel can in fact be blimmed, the only remaining possibility is that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
