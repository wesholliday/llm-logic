It cannot be both flooped and bimmed at the same time.\n2. \"It's not the case that the wug must be bimmed\": This statement tells us that the second possibility (the wug being bimmed) is not true.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n1. Since the wug cannot be both flooped and bimmed at the same time, and we know that it's not bimmed, then the only remaining possibility is that the wug must be flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
