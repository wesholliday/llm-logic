The first statement is \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked.\" This statement indicates that one of these two conditions must be true.\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked.\" This statement negates the second condition in the first statement, meaning that the fribble does not have to be crinked.\n3. However, the first statement also includes the possibility that the fribble could be snurgled instead of crinked.\n4. Since we know that the fribble cannot be required to be crinked, it doesn't mean that it can't be snurgled \u2013 only that it isn't required to be either snurgled or crinked.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer \"The fribble is snurgled\" with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no.",
