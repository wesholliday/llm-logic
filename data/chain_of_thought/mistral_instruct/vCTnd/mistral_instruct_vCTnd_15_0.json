The premise is 'If the room was tidied, then it was not tidied thoroughly.'\n2. The conclusion is 'If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied.'\n3. To check for logical validity, we need to see if the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n4. In this case, the premise and conclusion have opposite subjects and contradict each other.\n5. A contradiction is not a logical truth, so it cannot be a valid argument form.\n6. Therefore, the given argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no.",
