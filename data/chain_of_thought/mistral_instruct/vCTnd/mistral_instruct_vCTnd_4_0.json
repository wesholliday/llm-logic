In logic, the contrapositive of a statement \"If P then Q\" is \"If not Q then not P\". However, for this statement to be logically valid, both the original statement and its contrapositive must be true. In this case, since 'If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently' is a false statement (as studying can be done with varying levels of diligence), its contrapositive 'If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study' is also false.",
