If I ate a meal, then I did not eat a large meal.\n2. If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal.\n\nLet's analyze the argument step by step:\n\nFirst, we need to understand that 'If P, then Q' is logically equivalent to 'Not-P or Q'. So, let's convert the premises into their equivalent forms:\n\n1. Not-I ate a large meal or I ate a meal.\n2. Not-I ate a meal or I ate a large meal.\n\nNow, we can see that these two statements are not logically equivalent. In fact, they contradict each other. Therefore, the argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: no.",
