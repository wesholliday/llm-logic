If Jane studied, then she did not study long (premise)\n2. If Jane studied long, then she did not study (conclusion)\n\nTo test for logical validity, we can use the method of contrapositive. The contrapositive of an argument is formed by swapping the hypothesis and the conclusion, and negating each statement. So, let's find the contrapositive of our given argument:\n\n1. If she did not study long, then Jane did not study (from premise 1)\n2. If she studied, then she did not study (conclusion)\n\nNow, we can see that the conclusion does not follow logically from the premise because the second statement is a contradiction. A contradiction cannot be true, so an argument with a contradictory conclusion is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no.",
