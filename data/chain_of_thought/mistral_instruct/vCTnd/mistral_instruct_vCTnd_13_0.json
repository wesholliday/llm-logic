In this case, the argument is:\n\n1. If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much.\n2. Therefore, if Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise.\n\nThis form of argument is called a contradiction, because the second premise directly opposes the first one. The first premise states that if Alex exercises at all, then he does not exercise much. The second premise, however, states that if Alex exercises much, then he did not exercise at all. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, because they contradict each other.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no.",
