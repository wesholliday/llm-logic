The premise and the conclusion are opposite in meaning, so it cannot be logically valid for both to be true at the same time. In this case, if it's raining hard, then it is indeed raining, which contradicts the premise that 'if it's raining, then it's not raining hard'. Therefore, the argument is invalid.",
