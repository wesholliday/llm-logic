In this case, the argument is:\n\n1. If a recommendation was made, then it was not a strong recommendation.\n2. If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made.\n\nThe conclusion is implied by the first premise, but the first premise is not necessarily true. A recommendation can be both made and strong at the same time. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no.",
