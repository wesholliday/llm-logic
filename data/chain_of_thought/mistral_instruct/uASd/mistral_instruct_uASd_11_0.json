It does not make any mention of physical activity or hard labor.\n\nStep 3: Consider the relationship between sleep and hard labor\n\nHard labor can be physically demanding and exhausting, even for someone who gets enough sleep. While getting enough sleep can help improve energy levels and reduce feelings of fatigue, it may not completely eliminate tiredness when engaging in strenuous activities.\n\nStep 4: Formulate the answer\n\nAnswer: no. Although getting enough sleep can help reduce feelings of tiredness, it does not guarantee that one will not experience tiredness after performing hard labor.",
