It stays lit continuously to ensure the oven can be turned on easily when needed.\n\nStep 4: If the pilot light is out, it means the oven cannot be ignited and heated even if it's turned on.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, if the oven is on but the pilot light is out, then the kitchen would not be warm because the oven itself is not heating up.\n\nAnswer: no.",
