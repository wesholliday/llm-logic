If I water the plants, they will grow.\"\n\nStep 2: Understanding the new statement\n\nThe new statement is \"Can we infer that if I water the plants and there is no sunlight, they will grow?\"\n\nStep 3: Comparing the statements\n\nThe given statement talks about the growth of plants when watered. It does not mention anything about sunlight. The new statement asks if it can be inferred that plants will grow without sunlight when watered.\n\nStep 4: Reasoning\n\nPlants need both water and sunlight to grow. Water is essential for photosynthesis, which is the process by which plants convert carbon dioxide into food. Sunlight is also necessary for photosynthesis to occur efficiently. Without sunlight, even if the plants are watered, they may not be able to grow properly as they cannot carry out the process of photosynthesis effectively.\n\nStep 5: Conclusion and answer\n\nTherefore, based on our understanding of plant growth requirements, it can be concluded that 'Answer: no', plants will not grow if watered but without sunlight.",
