If the number of calories burned during exercise is less than the number of calories consumed through junk food, then weight loss may not occur or could even be reversed due to weight gain.\n\nStep 3: Consider the overall impact on weight loss\n\nReasoning: The net calorie intake (calories consumed) versus calorie output (calories burned) determines whether weight will be lost, maintained, or gained. If the calories burned from exercise are not sufficient to offset the caloric intake from junk food, then weight loss may not occur despite exercising.\n\nAnswer: No.",
