During a drought, even a well-fertilized lawn can struggle to stay lush and green due to the lack of water.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the inference\n\nThe inference being made is \"If I fertilize the lawn and there is a drought, it will be lush and green.\" However, as we've considered above, even with fertilization, a drought can prevent the lawn from staying lush and green.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\n\nAnswer: no.",
