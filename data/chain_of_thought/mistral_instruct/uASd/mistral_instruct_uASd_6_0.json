A scream is a loud, sharp sound produced by the human vocal cords. It is designed to be heard from a distance and can be quite distressing or even painful to the ears if heard at close range or for an extended period of time.\n\nNow, let's consider the effect of earplugs on the ability to hear sounds. Earplugs are designed to block out external noise by fitting snugly into the ear canal and creating a seal that prevents sound waves from reaching the eardrum. This means that even if someone is screaming nearby, the person wearing earplugs should not be able to hear it clearly or at all.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, we can conclude that if someone screams and another person is wearing earplugs, it will not hurt the other person's ears because they will not be able to hear the scream.\n\nAnswer: no.",
