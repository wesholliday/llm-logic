In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nLet's analyze the given argument step by step:\n\n1. If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside (Premise 1)\n2. The dog was inside (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the cat was outside (Conclusion)\n\nTo test for logical validity, we can use a truth table:\n\n| Dog Inside | Cat Outside |\n|---|---|\n| True   | True    |\n| True   | False   |\n| False  | True    |\n| False  | False   |\n\nSince the conclusion (Cat Outside) follows from the premises (Dog Inside and If Dog Inside, then Cat Outside) in every possible combination of truth values, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
