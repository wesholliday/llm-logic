In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nLet's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (First Premise)\n2. Mary was at the wedding (Second Premise)\n3. Therefore, Sue was at the wedding (Conclusion)\n\nTo test for logical validity, we can use a truth table:\n\n| Mary was at the wedding | Sue was at the wedding |\n|---|---|\n| True  |   True    |\n| True  |   False   |\n| False |   True    |\n| False |   False   |\n\nSince all rows in the truth table have a corresponding true conclusion, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
