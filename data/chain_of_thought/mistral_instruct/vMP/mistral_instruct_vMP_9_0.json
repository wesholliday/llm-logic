            "content": " To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to check if a true first and second premise guarantees a true conclusion. This is known as modus ponens in logic.\n\nHere are the steps to follow:\n\n1. Premises: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n                   Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\n2. Assuming the truth of both premises:\n   - Lisa bought the red shirt (given)\n   - If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt (assumed true)\n\n3. Applying modus ponens to derive the conclusion:\n   - Since the first premise is an if-then statement, we can rewrite it as two separate statements: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" becomes \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, Mark bought the blue shirt,\" and \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" becomes its negation, \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n   - Given that Lisa bought the red shirt (first premise), according to the second premise, Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\n4. Conclusion: Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nSince the conclusion follows logically from the given premises, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
