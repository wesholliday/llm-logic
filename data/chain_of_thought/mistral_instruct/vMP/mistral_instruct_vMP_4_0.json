Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter (Premise 1)\n2. The alien visited Mars (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the robot visited Jupiter (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premises. Here's why:\n\nEven if the first premise is true and the second premise is also true, it doesn't mean that the conclusion must be true. The conclusion only follows if there is an additional piece of information connecting the alien visiting Mars to the robot visiting Jupiter. Without this connection, the argument remains invalid.\n\nAnswer: no.",
