            "content": " To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis (Premise 1)\n2. Jeff played basketball (Premise 2)\n3. Conclusion: Amy played tennis\n\nTo test for logical validity, we can use a truth table. However, since the premises are conditional statements, it's easier to apply the rules of inference directly.\n\nThe given argument is an example of Modus Ponens (MP), which is a valid rule of inference. MP states that if we have two statements:\n\n1. If A, then B\n2. A\n\nThen we can infer B.\n\nIn our case, A represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and B represents \"Amy played tennis\". So, the argument follows the structure of Modus Ponens. Therefore, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
