            "content": " To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nLet's analyze the given argument step by step:\n\n1. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim (Premise 1)\n2. The shirt was cotton (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the pants were denim (Conclusion)\n\nTo check if this argument is logically valid, we can use a truth table:\n\n| Cotton (shirt) | Denim (pants) | If Cotton (shirt), then Denim (pants) |\n|---|---|---|\n| True  |   True    |     True      |\n| True  |   False   |     False      |\n| False |   True    |     True      |\n| False |   False   |     True      |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that whenever the premises are true, the conclusion is also true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
