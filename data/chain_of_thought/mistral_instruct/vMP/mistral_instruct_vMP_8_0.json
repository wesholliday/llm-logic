            "content": " To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nLet's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (Premise 1)\n2. The vampire was awake (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the mummy was awake (Conclusion)\n\nTo check if this argument is valid, we need to consider all possible scenarios where the premises could be true and ask ourselves if the conclusion must also be true in those cases. Let's consider a scenario where both the vampire and the mummy are awake:\n\nScenario: The vampire and the mummy are both awake\n\nIn this scenario, since the first premise states that \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake,\" it follows logically that the mummy is also awake because the condition stated in the premise (the vampire being awake) has been met. Therefore, in this scenario, the conclusion (the mummy being awake) necessarily follows from the premises, making the argument valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
