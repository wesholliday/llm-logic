            "content": " To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. In other words, if both premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nLet's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel (First Premise)\n2. The book was written by James (Second Premise)\n3. Therefore, the book is a mystery novel (Conclusion)\n\nGiven that the first premise is in the form of a conditional statement (if-then), we can test its validity by substituting the hypothesis (the thing being assumed to be true for the purpose of proving something else) with the given fact. In this case, the hypothesis is \"the book was written by James,\" and the given fact is also \"the book was written by James.\"\n\nSo, we substitute the hypothesis in the first premise with the given fact:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel (First Premise)\n2. The book was written by James (Second Premise)\n3. Substituting the hypothesis in the first premise with the second premise: If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel (First Premise) -> If the book was written by James, then the book = mystery novel\n4. The book was written by James (Second Premise) -> The book = James's book\n5. Substituting the second premise in the first premise: If the James's book was written by James, then the James's book is a mystery novel\n6. Therefore, the James's book is a mystery novel (Conclusion)\n\nSince the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
