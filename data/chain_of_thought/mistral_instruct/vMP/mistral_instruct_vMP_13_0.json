In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nLet's analyze the given argument step by step:\n\n1. If the car was red, then the truck was blue (First premise)\n2. The car was red (Second premise)\n3. Therefore, the truck was blue (Conclusion)\n\nHowever, just because the car being red implies that the truck is blue, it doesn't mean that the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In fact, there's no logical connection between the two statements. The color of one vehicle does not determine the color of another vehicle. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no.",
