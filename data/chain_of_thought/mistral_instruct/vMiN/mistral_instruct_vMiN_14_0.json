In this case, the premise is \"The milk might not be on the counter\" which can be written as \"It's possible that the milk is not on the counter,\" and the conclusion is \"It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter.\" This argument is logically valid because the negation of a conditional statement follows logically from the denial of its antecedent. In other words, if it's possible that the milk is not on the counter, then it cannot be the case that the milk must be on the counter. Answer: yes.",
