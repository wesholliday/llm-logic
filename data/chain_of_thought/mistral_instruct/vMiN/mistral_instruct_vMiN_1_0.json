Therefore, Mary must not have been at the wedding.\n\nThis argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise. The premise only states that it's possible that Mary was not at the wedding, but it does not prove that she definitely was not there. To reach the conclusion that \"Mary must not have been at the wedding,\" we would need additional information or a logical step that is missing in this argument.\n\nAnswer: no.",
