In other words, just because the premise is 'The watch might not be charging on the dresser', it doesn't logically follow that 'It's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser'. The former only states that the watch may not be charging there, while the latter denies that it must be charging there. Therefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no.",
