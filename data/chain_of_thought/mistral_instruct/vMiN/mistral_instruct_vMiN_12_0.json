The premise and conclusion have the same logical form (this is called having the same \"logical structure\"). In this case, both the premise and conclusion are negations of statements about the jacket being draped over the chair. So they do have the same logical form.\n2. The truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. In other words, if 'The jacket might not be draped over the chair' is true, then it logically follows that 'It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair'. This is a valid application of the rule of Modus Tollens in propositional logic.\n\nTherefore, based on these logical considerations, the answer is: Answer: yes.",
