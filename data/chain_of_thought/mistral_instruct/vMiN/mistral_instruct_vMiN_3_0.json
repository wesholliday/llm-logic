In this type of argument, the conclusion follows if the premises are true.\n\nHere's how to analyze it step by step:\n\n1. Premise: 'The book might not have been written by James'\n2. Conclusion: 'It's not the case that the book must have been written by James'\n\nTo check if this argument is logically valid, we need to determine if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In other words, if the premise is true, then is it necessarily true that the conclusion must also be true?\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n- 'The book might not have been written by James': This means there is a possibility or uncertainty that James did not write the book.\n- 'It's not the case that the book must have been written by James': This means it is not necessary or required that James wrote the book.\n\nSince the premise only states that James might not have written the book, and the conclusion denies that he must have written it, this argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
