The argument is logically valid because the negation of a conditional statement (\"It's not the case that if p then q\") is logically equivalent to the statement \"p and it's not the case that q.\" In this case, \"Alex might not have finished the race\" is the premise, and the conclusion \"It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race\" follows logically from it.",
