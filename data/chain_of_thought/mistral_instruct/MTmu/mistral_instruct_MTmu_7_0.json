This creates a conditional relationship between the two events.\n\nStatement 2 states that it is not necessary for Chris to have finished the race. This means Chris might or might not have finished.\n\nStep 3: Now let's consider the possibility of both Alex and Chris finishing the race based on the given statements.\n\nIf we assume that both Alex and Chris finished the race, then Statement 1 would be true because if Alex finished, Chris did as well. However, Statement 2 is also true since Chris finishing is not a necessity according to the statement. This creates a contradiction.\n\nStep 4: To resolve this contradiction, let's consider the opposite scenario - that Alex didn't finish the race.\n\nIf Alex didn't finish the race, then Statement 1 is false because the condition (Alex finishing) isn't met. Statement 2 remains true since Chris might or might not have finished.\n\nStep 5: Based on our analysis, we can infer that 'Alex did not finish the race'.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
