It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\n\nStep 2: Analyze each statement separately.\n\nStatement 1 implies a conditional relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana. If the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow.\n\nStatement 2 states that it's not the case that the banana must be yellow. This means that the banana can be some other color than yellow.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possibilities based on the given statements.\n\nIf Statement 1 is true, then when the apple is red, the banana must be yellow. However, Statement 2 tells us that it's not the case that the banana must be yellow. This creates a contradiction because we cannot have both \"if apple is red, then banana is yellow\" and \"banana is not necessarily yellow.\"\n\nStep 4: Determine if we can infer 'The apple was not red'.\n\nSince we have a contradiction between the two statements, it's impossible to determine for sure whether the apple was red or not based on the given information. Therefore, the statements do not allow us to infer 'The apple was not red'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
