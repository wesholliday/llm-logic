This is a conditional statement with an \"if-then\" relationship.\n\nStatement 2, however, states that it's not the case that Erin must take a train. This means that Erin might not have taken a train at all.\n\nStep 3: Determine if we can infer 'Sam did not take a plane'.\n\nGiven the information provided, we cannot directly infer that 'Sam did not take a plane'. The statements only tell us that Erin didn't take a train when Sam took a plane, but they don't necessarily mean that Sam didn't take a plane. There could be other possibilities where both Sam and Erin used different modes of transportation.\n\nAnswer: no.",
