It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel (given premise).\n3. From these two statements, we cannot directly infer 'The book was not written by James'. This is because there could be other possible explanations for why the book isn't a mystery novel even if it was written by James. For example, James might have written the book in a different genre this time.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information alone, we cannot infer 'The book was not written by James'.\n\nAnswer: no.",
