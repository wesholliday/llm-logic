However, Statement 2 tells us that Bob is not forced to choose pasta. This creates a contradiction because we cannot have both \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\" and \"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta\" true at the same time.\n\nStep 3: Determine the valid conclusion based on the given statements.\n\nSince we have a contradiction between the two statements, it is impossible for both of them to be true. Therefore, one or both of them must be false. Since Statement 1 implies that if Sue chooses pizza, then Bob cannot choose anything other than pasta, and Statement 2 tells us that Bob is not forced to choose pasta, it follows that Sue did not choose pizza (otherwise, the statements would contradict each other).\n\nAnswer: yes.",
