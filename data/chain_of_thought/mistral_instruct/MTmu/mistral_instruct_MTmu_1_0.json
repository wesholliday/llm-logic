It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding (also given in the question).\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot directly infer that \"Mary was not at the wedding.\" Here's why:\n\nThe first statement tells us that if Mary is present at a wedding, then Sue must also be present. The second statement tells us that it's not necessarily true that Sue is present at the wedding. However, it does not tell us that Sue is definitely absent or that Mary is absent.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"Mary was not at the wedding\" based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
