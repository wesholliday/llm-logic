It's not the case that the mummy was awake.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot directly infer that \"The vampire was not awake.\" Here's why:\n\nThe first statement establishes a conditional relationship between the two events \u2013 if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must be awake as well. However, the second statement negates only the condition about the mummy being awake and does not explicitly mention anything about the vampire.\n\nTherefore, even though it's not possible for both the vampire and the mummy to be awake based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that the vampire was not awake based on these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
