The second statement negates the proposition that the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possibilities\n\nIf the cake was chocolate, then according to Statement 1, the muffins would have had to be blueberry. However, Statement 2 tells us that it's not the case that the muffins were blueberry. This creates a contradiction between the given statements.\n\nStep 4: Infer the answer\n\nSince there is a contradiction in the given statements, it means that neither of them can be true at the same time. Therefore, one or both of the statements must be false. Since we cannot determine which statement is false based on the information provided, we cannot definitively say whether the cake was not chocolate. However, we do know that there is a contradiction in the given statements, so it's reasonable to assume that some part of the information is incorrect.\n\nAnswer: It is impossible to determine 'The cake was not chocolate' based on the given statements alone. However, since there is a contradiction in the statements, it's likely that one or both of them contain incorrect information.",
