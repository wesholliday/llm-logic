The second statement negates the proposition in Statement 1 that the truck must have been metal. However, it does not directly mention anything about the doll being plastic or not.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possibilities based on the given information.\n\nSince we cannot infer for certain whether the doll is plastic or not from the given statements, we cannot definitively say that 'The doll was not plastic'. Therefore, the answer is: Answer: no.",
