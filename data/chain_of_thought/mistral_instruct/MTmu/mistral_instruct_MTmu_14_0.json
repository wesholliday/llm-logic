However, the second statement states that it is not the case that the wolf is in the den. This means that the wolf is not necessarily in the den when the bear is in the cave.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possibility of the bear not being in the cave\n\nSince we cannot infer that the wolf is in the den when the bear is in the cave, and we know that the wolf is not in the den (from Statement 2), it is possible that neither the bear nor the wolf are in their respective locations. Therefore, 'The bear was not in the cave' is a valid conclusion based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
