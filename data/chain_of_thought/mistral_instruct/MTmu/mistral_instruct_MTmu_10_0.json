The second statement states that it's not necessarily true that the cat was outside.\n\nStep 3: Consider possible scenarios\n\nScenario 1: Dog inside, Cat outside\nThis scenario satisfies both statements.\n\nScenario 2: Dog outside, Cat inside\nThis scenario contradicts Statement 1 but is consistent with Statement 2.\n\nStep 4: Determine if we can infer 'The dog was not inside'\n\nBased on the given statements alone, we cannot infer that 'The dog was not inside'. The statements only provide information about the possible locations of the cat based on the dog's location. They do not definitively state that the dog is not inside.\n\nAnswer: no.",
