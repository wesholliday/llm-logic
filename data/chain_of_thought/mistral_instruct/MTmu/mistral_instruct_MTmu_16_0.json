The second statement negates this implication, stating that it's not necessarily true that the pants are denim when the shirt is cotton.\n\nStep 3: Determine if we can infer 'The shirt was not cotton'.\n\nNo, we cannot infer 'The shirt was not cotton' based on the given statements. The statements only tell us that the pants are not necessarily denim when the shirt is cotton. They do not provide enough information to conclude that the shirt is not cotton.\n\nAnswer: No.",
