The second statement states that the truck is not necessarily blue.\n\nSince the second statement contradicts the implication in the first statement, it means that the first statement is false. Therefore, the conditional statement \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\" cannot be true.\n\nStep 3: Determine what can be inferred from the given statements.\n\nSince the first statement is false, neither of the premises (the car being red or the truck being blue) can be assumed as true based on the information provided. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The car was not red' with certainty based on the given statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
