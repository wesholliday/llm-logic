    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect are applying for one open zulision. The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

If the cramen doesn't get the zulision, then the sulect will.\n3. It's likely that the jantiz will get the zulision based on their qualifications.\n4. However, the likelihood of the cramen or sulect getting the zulision depends solely on the decision-making process of the person or committee granting the zulision.\n5. Even though it's likely that the jantiz will get it, there is still a chance that they might not, and if that happens, then the cramen would be the next in line to receive it.\n6. Therefore, while it's less likely, it's still possible that if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will.\n\nAnswer: Yes, it is possible.",
