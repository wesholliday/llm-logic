    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crastin, a nivet, and a jomial are the top bispets this breeding season. Breeders expect the crastin likely will birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, with the jomial birthing many fewer. These lead in birthing, so if the nivet doesn\u2019t birth the most offspring, then if the crastin doesn\u2019t, the jomial will. Moreover, the crastin likely will lead births and hence the nivet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the crastin doesn\u2019t lead births, the jomial will?",

            "content": " Explanation:\n\n1. We know that the crastin is expected to birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, and the jomial will birth fewer than both.\n2. The crastin is likely to lead in births, meaning they will give birth first among the three.\n3. If the crastin doesn't lead in births (i.e., they don't give birth first), then it follows that either the nivet or jomial must have given birth before them.\n4. Since the nivet is expected to give birth after the crastin, and the crastin didn't lead in births, it must be that the jomial gave birth before the crastin (since the nivet couldn't have).\n5. Therefore, if the crastin doesn't lead in births, it is likely that the jomial will have given birth already.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
