    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a garplex, a beelhet, and a peedonk are competing to be domer of the year. Experts think the garplex is most likely to win, followed closely by the beelhet, with the peedonk having a much lower chance. Since these are the only domer candidates, if the beelhet doesn\u2019t become domer, then if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will become domer. Moreover, it is likely the garplex will become domer and hence the beelhet likely won\u2019t become domer. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will?",

If neither the garplex nor the beelhet becomes domer, then the peedonk will become domer.\n3. It's more likely that the garplex will become domer than the beelhet, so it's less likely that the beelhet will become domer.\n4. However, we cannot determine with certainty that the beelhet won't become domer if the garplex doesn't, as there are still other factors that could influence the outcome.\n\nAnswer: No, it does not follow that it's likely that, if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will. While it is a possibility based on the information given, it is not a certainty.",
