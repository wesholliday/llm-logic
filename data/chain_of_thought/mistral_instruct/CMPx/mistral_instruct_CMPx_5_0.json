    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fraglen, a darpil, and a votal are the top bispil teams this season. The fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by the darpil, while the votal trails far behind. These lead the league, so if the darpil doesn\u2019t have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn\u2019t, the votal will. Moreover, the fraglen likely will lead the league and hence the darpil likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fraglen doesn\u2019t lead the league, the votal will?",

If the darpil doesn't have the top record, then it follows that the fraglen must have a better record than the darpil.\n3. The statement also suggests that if the fraglen doesn't lead the league, then the darpil likely won't either.\n4. However, this does not necessarily mean that the votal will lead the league if the fraglen doesn't. It only means that if neither the fraglen nor the darpil leads the league, then the votal is the most likely candidate to do so.\n5. Therefore, while it's possible that the votal will lead the league if the fraglen doesn't, it's not a certainty based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: No, it's not likely that if the fraglen doesn't lead the league, the votal will. It's only possible.",
