    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantole, a dribban, and a cruggit are the most downloaded fillip apps this month. Market watchers expect the fantole likely will retain the top spot in downloads, followed by the dribban, with the cruggit download rate significantly lower. These lead the downloads, so if the dribban isn\u2019t the most downloaded, then if the fantole isn\u2019t, the cruggit will be. Moreover, the fantole likely will lead downloads and hence the dribban likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fantole isn\u2019t the most downloaded, the cruggit will be?",

If the fantole doesn't have the most downloads, then the dribban must have more downloads (since it's the only other option mentioned).\n3. However, it was also stated that the fantole \"likely will lead downloads,\" which implies a lower probability that it won't be the most downloaded app.\n4. Therefore, even though the dribban would be the most likely alternative if the fantole isn't the most downloaded, it's not guaranteed that the cruggit would be the most downloaded in this scenario.\n\nAnswer: No.",
