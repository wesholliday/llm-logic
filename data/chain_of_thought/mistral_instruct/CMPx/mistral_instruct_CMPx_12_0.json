    "user_prompt": "Suppose a stribben, a vanoon, and a jentapp are applying to rent a bondle. The owner thinks the stribben is the strongest applicant, followed by the vanoon, while the jentapp seems much less qualified to rent a bondle. Since these are the only applicants, if the vanoon isn\u2019t selected, then if the stribben isn\u2019t selected, the jentapp will be selected. Moreover, the stribben likely will be chosen and hence the vanoon likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the stribben isn\u2019t selected to rent the bondle, the jentapp will be?",

If neither the Stribben nor the Vanoon is selected, then the Jentapp will be the one to rent the bondle.\n3. It's more likely that the Stribben will be chosen over the Vanoon and the Jentapp due to the owner's preference.\n4. However, the fact that the Jentapp will be the only alternative if both the Stribben and Vanoon are not selected doesn't necessarily mean it's likely that the Jentapp will be chosen instead of the Stribben. The owner still has a preferred choice (Stribben).\n\nAnswer: No, it is not likely that, if the stribben isn\u2019t selected to rent the bondle, the jentapp will be. While it's true that the Jentapp would be the next best option, the owner's preference for the Stribben makes it more likely that the Stribben will be chosen instead.",
