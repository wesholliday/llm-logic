    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantug, a loperit, and a frallon are shortlisted for Blither of the Year. Industry watchers consider the fantug the front runner, followed by the loperit, while the frallon is a heavy underdog. Since these are the only products in contention, if the loperit doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the fantug doesn\u2019t win, the frallon will win. Moreover, the fantug likely will win the award and hence the loperit likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantug doesn't win Blither of the Year, the frallon will?",

The frallon is a heavy underdog, meaning it's less likely to win based on current expectations.\n3. If neither the fantug nor the loperit wins, then the frallon would be the only remaining option and thus would win by default.\n4. However, it's more likely that either the fantug or the loperit will win, given their current standing in industry watchers' predictions.\n5. Therefore, while it's possible for the frallon to win if neither the fantug nor the loperit do, it's less likely based on current expectations.\n\nAnswer: No, it's not likely that the frallon will win Blither of the Year if the fantug doesn't. While it's possible, given the current state of predictions, it's considered less likely due to the loperit being a closer second choice.",
