    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trenist, a lanken, and a draloid are shortlisted for Drij of the Year. The trenist is considered the front runner, followed by the lanken, while the draloid is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates in contention, if the lanken doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the trenist doesn\u2019t win it, the draloid will win it. Moreover, the trenist likely will win the award and hence the lanken likely won\u2019t win it. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trenist doesn\u2019t win Drij of the Year, the draloid will?",

            "content": " Reasoning:\n\n1. We know that if the trenist doesn't win, then the draloid wins (since there are only three candidates).\n2. It is also mentioned that the trenist is likely to win the award.\n3. However, the fact that the trenist is likely to win does not negate the possibility that they might not win.\n4. Therefore, while it's less likely that the draloid will win if the trenist does win, it's still possible for the draloid to win if the trenist doesn't.\n5. However, since the trenist is considered the front runner and is more likely to win, it follows that it's less likely that the draloid will win overall.\n\nAnswer: No, it does not follow that it's likely that, if the trenist doesn\u2019t win Drij of the Year, the draloid will. While it's possible for the draloid to win in this scenario, it's less likely given that the trenist is considered the front runner.",
