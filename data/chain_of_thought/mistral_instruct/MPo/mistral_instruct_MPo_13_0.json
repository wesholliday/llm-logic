This is a fact, so it's true.\n\nStep 5: Check the truth of the conditional statement.\n\n- If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n\nThis conditional statement asserts that under the condition that 'the car is red', it follows that 'the truck is blue'. To determine if this is true, we need to check if every instance where the car is red, the truck is indeed blue. Since we don't have enough information to make that determination, the conditional statement itself might be false or could be true depending on other circumstances.\n\nStep 6: Conclusion.\n\nSince we cannot determine the truth of the conditional statement with the given information alone, we cannot infer 'The truck was blue'.\n\nAnswer: no.",
