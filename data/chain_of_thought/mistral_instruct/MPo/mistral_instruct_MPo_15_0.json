We have two pieces of information: Sam took a plane, and if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n2. The second piece of information is a conditional statement, which means that under certain conditions, Erin taking a train follows from Sam taking a plane.\n3. However, having a conditional statement does not directly imply that the consequent (Erin took a train) is true; it only implies that if the antecedent (Sam took a plane) is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n4. In order to infer that Erin took a train based on the given information, we would need to know that Sam indeed took a plane.\n5. Therefore, while the conditional statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" allows us to make the inference if we already know that Sam took a plane, it does not provide sufficient information on its own to infer that Erin took a train without first knowing that Sam took a plane.\n\nAnswer: No.",
