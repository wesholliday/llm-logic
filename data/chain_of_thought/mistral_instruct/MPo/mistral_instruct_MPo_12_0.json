Joe went to the park\n2. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, meaning it sets up a relationship between two events. In this case, the first event is \"Joe went to the park,\" and the second event is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nTo infer that \"Lucy went to the zoo\" from these statements, we need to consider if both conditions are met:\n\n1. Is it true that \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\"?\n2. Did \"Joe go to the park\" occur?\n\nLet's examine each condition:\n\nCondition 1: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\"\nThis statement is a conditional statement, and it tells us that whenever Joe goes to the park, Lucy goes to the zoo. It does not guarantee that Lucy always goes to the zoo, but rather that she goes to the zoo whenever Joe goes to the park.\n\nCondition 2: \"Joe went to the park\"\nThis statement is a fact, and it tells us that Joe did indeed go to the park.\n\nSince both conditions are met (Joe went to the park, and the conditional statement tells us Lucy goes to the zoo whenever Joe goes to the park), we can infer that \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
