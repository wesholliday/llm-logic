In this case, if the condition (the doll being plastic) is true, then the consequence (the truck being metal) must also be true.\n\nStep 5: However, we only have information about the doll being plastic; we don't know for sure whether the truck is metal or not.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, even though the conditional statement suggests that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal, we cannot directly infer that the truck is metal based on just this information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
