If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nThe second statement is an implication, which means that if the first condition (griffin being in the forest) is true, then the second condition (unicorn being in the forest) must also be true. This is a logical rule and does not depend on any specific facts about griffins or unicorns.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that 'The unicorn was in the forest'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
