We know that \"The shirt was cotton.\"\n2. We also know that \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\"\n\nTo infer that \"The pants were denim,\" we need to use the given conditional statement (if-then rule) and the known fact:\n\n1. Given: The shirt was cotton.\n2. Conditional Statement: If the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim.\n\nNow let's apply the conditional statement to our given fact:\n\nSince \"The shirt was cotton,\" we can substitute this into the conditional statement as follows:\n\n\"If the shirt (which is cotton) was cotton, then the pants were denim.\"\n\nSince the premise of the conditional statement matches the known fact, the conclusion must be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The pants were denim.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
