            "content": " To answer this question, let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. We have two statements: \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the condition) is true, then the second part (the consequence) must also be true.\n3. In this case, the condition is \"Lisa bought the red shirt,\" and the consequence is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n4. Therefore, to determine if we can infer that \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" from the given statements, we need to check if the first statement (\"Lisa bought the red shirt\") is true or false.\n5. If the first statement is true, then according to the conditional statement, the second statement must also be true (i.e., \"Mark bought the blue shirt\").\n6. So, based on the given information, if we know that \"Lisa bought the red shirt,\" then we can infer that \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
