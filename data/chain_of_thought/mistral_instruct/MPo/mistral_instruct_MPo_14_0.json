The bear was in the cave\n2. If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\n\nFirst, we need to understand that an \"if-then\" statement implies a conditional relationship between two statements. In this case, if statement 1 (The bear was in the cave) is true, then statement 2 (The wolf was in the den) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, since statement 1 is given as a fact and statement 2 is an implication of that fact, we can infer that \"The wolf was in the den\" is indeed true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
