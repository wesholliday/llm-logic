Tom watched football.\n2. If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n\nFrom this information alone, we cannot directly infer that \"Jen watched basketball.\" Here's why:\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, meaning it sets up a relationship between two events. In this case, the statement says that if Tom watches football, then Jen watches basketball. However, just because the condition (Tom watching football) is true does not necessarily mean that the consequence (Jen watching basketball) must also be true.\n\nFor example, Tom could have watched football, but Jen might not have watched basketball for any number of reasons \u2013 she might have been busy with other activities, or she might not have had access to a basketball court or television.\n\nTherefore, even though the conditional statement suggests that Jen watched basketball when Tom watched football, it does not guarantee that this was the case. As a result, we cannot infer that \"Jen watched basketball\" based on the given information alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
