It only states that the apple is red.\n\nStep 3: Understand the conditional statement (if-then) in Statement 2.\n\n- A conditional statement \"If p, then q\" means that if p is true, then q must be true.\n\nStep 4: Apply the conditional statement to our situation.\n\n- Since Statement 1 tells us that p (the apple is red), we need to check if q (the banana is yellow) is also true based on Statement 2.\n\nStep 5: Check if Statement 2 implies that the banana is yellow.\n\n- Yes, according to Statement 2, if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow. Therefore, if we know that the apple is red, it follows logically that the banana must be yellow.\n\nAnswer: yes",
