We have two statements: \"Alex finished the race\" and \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\"\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the condition) is true, then the second part (the consequence) must also be true.\n3. In this case, the condition is \"Alex finished the race,\" and the consequence is \"Chris finished the race.\"\n4. Therefore, if both statements are true, then we can infer that \"Chris finished the race\" is also true.\n5. Answer: yes.",
