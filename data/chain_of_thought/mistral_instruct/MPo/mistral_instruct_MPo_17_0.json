We have two statements: \"Ben ate pasta\" and \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\"\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (premise) is true, then the second part (conclusion) must also be true.\n3. In this case, the premise is \"Ben ate pasta,\" and the conclusion is \"Kate ate the salad.\"\n4. To infer that \"Kate ate the salad\" from \"Ben ate pasta,\" we need to ensure that both statements are true and that the conditional statement holds.\n5. We have been given that \"Ben ate pasta\" is true, so let's check if \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\" is also true.\n6. If this conditional statement is true, it means that whenever Ben eats pasta, Kate must eat the salad as well.\n7. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"Kate ate the salad.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
