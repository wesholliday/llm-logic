It does not provide any information about the muffins.\n\nStep 3: Understand the meaning of 'if...then' statements.\n\nAn 'if...then' statement means that if the condition in the 'if' part is true, then the statement in the 'then' part must also be true.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the given 'if...then' statement.\n\nThe 'if...then' statement tells us that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry. This means that according to this statement, both conditions must be true for the conclusion to hold.\n\nStep 5: Determine if we can infer 'The muffins were blueberry'.\n\nWe cannot directly infer that 'The muffins were blueberry' from the given statements because we do not have enough information. The second statement only tells us that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry. It does not guarantee that the cake is chocolate or even that we know anything about the muffins other than what is stated in the 'if...then' condition.\n\nAnswer: No.",
