It is a conditional statement with the form \"If p, then q.\" This means that if p (Sue choosing pizza) is true, then q (Bob choosing pasta) must also be true.\n\nStep 3: Given Statement 1, Sue did indeed choose pizza.\n\nStep 4: Since Statement 2 tells us that if Sue chooses pizza, then Bob chooses pasta, and we know that Sue chose pizza, it follows logically that Bob must have chosen pasta according to the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
