The reason is that the conditional statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" does not necessarily mean that every book written by James is a mystery novel. It only implies that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel in this specific case.\n\nTherefore, we cannot make a generalization based on this information alone and infer that all books written by James are mystery novels. We would need additional evidence to support such a claim.\n\nAnswer: No.",
