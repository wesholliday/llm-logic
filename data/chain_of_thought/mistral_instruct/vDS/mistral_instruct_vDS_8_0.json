Premise 1: Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch.\n2. Premise 2: The remote control isn't hiding under the couch.\n3. Conclusion: The remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nReasoning: Since we know that the remote control is not hiding under the couch (premise 2), then by elimination, it must be on the coffee table (conclusion). This is a valid form of reasoning called disjunctive syllogism.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
