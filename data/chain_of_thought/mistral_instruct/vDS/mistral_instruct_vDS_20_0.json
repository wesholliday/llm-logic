Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. Premise 1: Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they are perched on her head.\n2. Premise 2: The sunglasses aren't perched on her head.\n3. Conclusion: The sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nSince the premises exclude the possibility of the sunglasses being perched on her head, and the conclusion asserts that they are in her bag (an alternative to being perched on her head), if both premises are true, then the conclusion must be true as well. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
