Let's analyze the given argument step by step:\n\n1. Premise 1: Either the milk is on the counter or it is chilling in the fridge.\n2. Premise 2: The milk isn't chilling in the fridge.\n3. Conclusion: The milk is on the counter.\n\nGiven premises 1 and 2, we can infer that the milk must be on the counter because if it were chilling in the fridge, then it would not be the case that \"The milk isn't chilling in the fridge\" (premise 2). Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
