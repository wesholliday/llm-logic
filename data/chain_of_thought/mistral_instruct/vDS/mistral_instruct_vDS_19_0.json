Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. Premise 1: Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist.\n2. Premise 2: The watch isn't on his wrist.\n3. Conclusion: The watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nGiven the premises, there are only two possibilities for the location of the watch: either it is on the dresser charging or it is on the person's wrist. If the second premise states that the watch is not on his wrist, then the only remaining possibility is that the watch must be on the dresker, charging. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
