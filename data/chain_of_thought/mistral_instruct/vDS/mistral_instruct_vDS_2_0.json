Let's analyze the given argument step by step:\n\n1. Premise 1: Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table.\n2. Premise 2: The book isn't resting on the table.\n3. Conclusion: The book is on the shelf.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate one possibility from premise 1: if the book is not resting on the table, then it cannot be resting on the table, so we can conclude that the book must be on the shelf according to premise 1. However, premise 2 states that the book isn't resting on the table but does not mention anything about the shelf. Therefore, even though the conclusion follows from premise 1 alone, the argument is not logically valid because premise 2 does not provide enough information to guarantee the truth of the conclusion based on both premises.\n\nAnswer: no.",
