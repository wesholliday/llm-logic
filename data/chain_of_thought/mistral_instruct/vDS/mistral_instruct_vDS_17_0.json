Premise 1: Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it is draped on the coat rack.\n2. Premise 2: The scarf isn't draped on the coat rack.\n3. Conclusion: The scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nGiven the premises, there are only two possibilities for the scarf: either it's in the backpack or it's on the coat rack. Since Premise 2 states that it's not on the coat rack, then by the Law of Excluded Middle, it must be in the backpack. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
