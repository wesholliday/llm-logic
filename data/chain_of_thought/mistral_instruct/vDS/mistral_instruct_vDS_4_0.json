Premise 1: Either the cat is napping on the couch or it's playing in the bedroom.\n2. Premise 2: The cat isn't playing in the bedroom.\n3. Conclusion: The cat is napping on the couch.\n\nSince the premises exclude the possibility of the cat being in the bedroom playing, and the only other option given is that the cat is napping on the couch, the conclusion follows logically from the premises. Therefore, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
