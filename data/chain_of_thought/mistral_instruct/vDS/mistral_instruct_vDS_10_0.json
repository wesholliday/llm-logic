Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. Premise 1: Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it's under the bed.\n2. Premise 2: The missing sock isn't under the bed.\n3. Conclusion: The missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate any possibilities that contradict the premises and conclusion. Since we know that the missing sock is not under the bed (Premise 2), it cannot be in both places at once according to Premise 1. Therefore, if the missing sock is not under the bed, then it must be in the laundry basket (as stated in the Conclusion).\n\nThus, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
