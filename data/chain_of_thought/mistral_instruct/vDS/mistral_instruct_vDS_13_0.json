A contradiction would be something like \"P and not-P\" where P is a statement. In this case, the premises are \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf\" and \"The toy isn't sitting on the shelf.\" Neither of these statements is the negation of the other, so no contradiction can be derived from them.\n\nNext, let's consider if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. The conclusion is \"The toy is in the toy box,\" which follows logically from the premises since we know that the toy cannot be on the shelf based on the second premise and the first premise tells us that if it's not on the shelf, then it must be in the toy box.\n\nTherefore, Answer: yes. The argument is logically valid.",
