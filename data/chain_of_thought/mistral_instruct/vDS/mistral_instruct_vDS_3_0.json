Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. Premise 1: Either the keys are in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet.\n2. Premise 2: The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet.\n3. Conclusion: The keys are in the drawer.\n\nReasoning: Since we know that the keys cannot be dangling in the cabinet (premise 2), then the only remaining option is that they must be in the drawer (premise 1). Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
