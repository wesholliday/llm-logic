Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. Premise 1: Either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry.\n2. Premise 2: The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry.\n3. Conclusion: The cookies are in the jar.\n\nReasoning: Since we know that the cookies cannot be hidden in the pantry (premise 2), then the only remaining option is that they must be in the jar (as stated in premise 1). Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
