Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. Premise 1: Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden.\n2. Premise 2: Fido is not in the garden.\n3. Conclusion: Fido is inside.\n\nGiven premises 1 and 2, we can infer that Fido is not in the garden excludes the possibility of Fido being outside (in the garden). Therefore, the only remaining option for Fido's location is 'inside'. Thus, the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
