The first premise states that either the notebook is in the drawer or it is on the nightstand. This is a disjunction (or statement) and does not lead to a contradiction on its own.\n2. The second premise states that the notebook is not on the nightstand. This does not contradict the first premise since it only negates one of the alternatives in the disjunction.\n3. From these two premises, we can infer that the notebook must be in the drawer because the only other alternative (it being on the nightstand) has been ruled out.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
