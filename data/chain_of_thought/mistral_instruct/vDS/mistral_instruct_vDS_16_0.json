Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. Premise 1: Either the pen is in my bag or it is on my desk.\n2. Premise 2: The pen isn't on my desk.\n3. Conclusion: The pen is in my bag.\n\nGiven the premises, we have two possibilities for the location of the pen: either it is in the bag or on the desk. However, the second premise states that the pen is not on the desk. Since there are no other possible locations mentioned in the argument, this means that the pen must be in the bag. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
