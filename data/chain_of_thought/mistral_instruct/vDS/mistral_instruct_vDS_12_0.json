Premise 1: Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it is hanging in the closet.\n2. Premise 2: The jacket isn't hanging in the closet.\n3. Conclusion: The jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate one possibility from Premise 1: if the jacket is not hanging in the closet (as per Premise 2), then it must be draped over the chair according to Premise 1. Therefore, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
