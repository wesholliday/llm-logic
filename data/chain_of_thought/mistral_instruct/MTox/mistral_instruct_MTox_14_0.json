We have two statements: \"The clug did not snugged\" and \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\"\n2. The first statement means that the clug did not snug (or fit closely) with something or someone.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which says that if the clug was fleeked (smoothed or made perfect), then it would have snugged (fitted closely).\n4. However, we know from the first statement that the clug did not snug, so it was not in a state where it could fit closely with something.\n5. Since the second statement says that if the clug was fleeked, it would snug, and we know that it did not snug, then it follows logically that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
