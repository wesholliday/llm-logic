The first statement is \"The sprocket was not daggled.\"\n2. The second statement is \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\"\n\nNow let's consider what would happen if we assume that the sprocket was cranked:\n\n1. According to the second statement, if the sprocket was cranked, it would have been daggled.\n2. However, the first statement tells us that the sprocket was not daggled.\n3. Since these statements contradict each other, they cannot both be true at the same time.\n4. Therefore, the assumption that \"The sprocket was cranked\" must be false.\n\nSo, based on the given statements, we can infer that 'Answer: no, The sprocket was not cranked'.",
