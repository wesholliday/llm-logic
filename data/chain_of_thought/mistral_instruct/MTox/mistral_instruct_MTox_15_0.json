We know that \"The dreb was not spended.\"\n2. We also know that \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\"\n3. However, we don't have any information about whether or not the dreb was vroombed.\n4. To infer that \"The dreb was not vroombed,\" we would need to know that it is impossible for the dreb to have been vroombed without being spent. But we do not have this information.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
