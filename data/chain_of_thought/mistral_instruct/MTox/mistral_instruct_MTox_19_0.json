'The smonk did not plagged': This statement means that the smonk did not plag (plag being an unknown action).\n2. 'If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged': This conditional statement can be read as \"if the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged something.\"\n\nNow let's consider if it is possible for both statements to be true at the same time:\n\n1. If 'The smonk was not vreebled' were false and 'The smonk was vreebled' were true, then according to the second statement, 'The smonk plagged' would also have to be true. However, this contradicts the first statement that says 'The smonk did not plagged'.\n2. Therefore, for both statements to be true, 'The smonk was not vreebled' must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
