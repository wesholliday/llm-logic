The first statement tells us that the snow did not produce a fragrant smell, which is the opposite of what would happen if the snow were compacted and thawed.\n2. The second statement tells us that if the snow had been compacted, it would have produced a fragrant smell.\n3. However, we know from the first statement that the snow did not produce a fragrant smell, so it follows logically that the snow was not compacted or crushed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer 'The sneg was not crampled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
