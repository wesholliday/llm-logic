We know that \"The wug was not garpled.\"\n2. We also know that \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\"\n3. However, we don't have any information about whether or not the wug was sproinged.\n4. To infer \"The wug was not sproinged,\" we would need to know that it couldn't be both not garpled and sproinged at the same time. But since we don't have enough information, we cannot make that assumption.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: no.",
