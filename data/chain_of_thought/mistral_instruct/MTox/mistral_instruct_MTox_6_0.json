The grommet did not plop the frink.\n2. If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nFrom statement 2, we can derive the contrapositive:\nIf the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nNow, let's check if our inference 'The grommet was not sploffed' is valid by using the given statements and the derived statement:\n1. The grommet did not plop the frink.\n2. If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nBoth statements are consistent with each other. Therefore, our inference 'The grommet was not sploffed' is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
