We know that \"The shank was not nugged.\"\n2. We also know that \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\"\n3. However, we do not have any information given about whether or not the shank was plooked.\n4. To infer that \"The shank was not plooked,\" we would need to know that it is impossible for both conditions to be true at the same time (i.e., the negation of \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\" must be true).\n5. But since we don't have any information about whether or not the shank was plooked, we cannot make that inference with certainty.\n\nTherefore, Answer: no.",
