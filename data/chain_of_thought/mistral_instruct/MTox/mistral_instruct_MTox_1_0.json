The first statement is \"The flugel was not zargled.\"\n2. The second statement is \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\"\n\nLet's break down the second statement into its component parts:\n\n- \"If the flugel was blimmed\" is a conditional statement with the hypothesis being \"the flugel was blimmed.\"\n- The conclusion of this conditional statement is \"then the flugel was zargled.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the given statements and try to infer that \"The flugel was not blimmed\" based on them:\n\n1. We know that \"The flugel was not zargled.\"\n2. The second statement tells us that if the flugel had been blimmed, then it would have been zargled.\n\nHowever, we don't have any information about whether or not the flugel was actually blimmed in the given statements. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot infer that \"The flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
