We have two given statements: \"The flob did not movated\" and \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated.\"\n2. The first statement tells us that the flob did not move at all.\n3. The second statement establishes a conditional relationship between being skizzled and moving for the flob.\n4. To infer \"The flob was not skizzled,\" we would need to use the given statements to deduce that there is no possible way the flob could have been skizzled based on the information provided.\n5. However, since the first statement tells us that the flob did not move at all, it doesn't necessarily mean that the flob was never skizzled before this moment. The second statement only tells us that if the flob is skizzled, then it moves. It does not guarantee that being skizzled always causes movement or that the flob is currently being skizzled.\n6. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The flob was not skizzled\" based on the given statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
