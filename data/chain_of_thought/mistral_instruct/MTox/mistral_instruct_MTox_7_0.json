The first statement means that the whiffle did not make a tinking sound when it occurred.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the whiffle was shanked (hit poorly), then it would have made a tinking sound.\n4. However, we know from the first statement that the whiffle did not make a tinking sound, so it was not shanked according to the second statement.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer 'The whiffle was not shanked'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
