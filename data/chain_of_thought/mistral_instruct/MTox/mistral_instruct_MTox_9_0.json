We know that \"The twonk was not varnished.\"\n2. We also know that \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\"\n3. However, we don't have any information about whether or not the twonk was plinked.\n4. To infer \"The twonk was not plinked,\" we would need to know that plinking the twonk is the only way it can be varnished, which is not given in the information provided.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer \"The twonk was not plinked.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
