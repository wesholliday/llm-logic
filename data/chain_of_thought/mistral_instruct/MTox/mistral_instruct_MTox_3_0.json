We have two conditional statements:\n   a) If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked (If P, then Q)\n   b) The splat did not quank (Not-Q)\n\n2. To find out if we can infer 'The splat was not morphed' (Not-P), we need to use the rule of Modus Tollens:\n   If (If P, then Q) and Not-Q, then Not-P\n\n3. Applying this rule to our given statements:\n   a) If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\n   b) The splat did not quank\n\n4. Since both conditions are met (conditional statement and its negation), we can infer 'The splat was not morphed'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
