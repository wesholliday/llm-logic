We have two statements: 'The fribble did not crink' and 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked'.\n2. The first statement tells us that the fribble did not crink when it was not snurgled (since crinking is mentioned as a consequence of snurgling in the second statement).\n3. The second statement states that if the fribble was snurgled, then it would have crinked.\n4. However, we don't know whether or not the fribble was actually snurgled based on the given information.\n5. Therefore, even though we can deduce that the fribble did not crink when it was not snurgled (from statement 1), we cannot infer for certain that the fribble was not snurgled based on the given statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
