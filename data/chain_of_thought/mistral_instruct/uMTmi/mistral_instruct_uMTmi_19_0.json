The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\" does not mean that Jen only watches basketball when Tom watches football. It means that if Tom watches football, then Jen also watches basketball (but it doesn't necessarily follow that she doesn't watch anything else). Additionally, the second part of the statement \"Jen might not have watched basketball\" indicates that there are other possibilities for what Jen could have watched besides basketball. Therefore, just because we don't know for sure that Jen watched basketball when Tom watched football, it does not mean that Tom definitely did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: no.",
