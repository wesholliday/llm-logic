Therefore, just because the alien visited Mars does not necessarily mean that the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nFurthermore, there is no information provided about whether or not the alien visited Mars. So we cannot make a definitive conclusion about that either.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: no.",
