It means that if the doll is plastic, then the truck cannot be plastic and must be metal instead. However, it does not necessarily mean that the doll is not plastic.\n\nThe second part of the question states \"Also, the truck might not have been metal.\" This means that there is a possibility that the truck was not metal.\n\nTherefore, even if we know that the truck cannot be plastic if the doll is plastic, and there is a possibility that the truck was not metal, we still cannot infer for certain that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: no.",
