It means that if one condition (griffin being in the forest) is true, then another condition (unicorn being in the forest) must also be true. However, this does not mean that if the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin could not have been there as well.\n\nTherefore, just because the unicorn might not have been in the forest, it does not allow us to infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no.",
