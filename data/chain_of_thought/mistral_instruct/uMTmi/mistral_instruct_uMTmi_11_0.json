It means that if one condition (the cake being chocolate) is true, then another condition (muffins being blueberry) must also be true. However, this does not mean that if the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake could not have been chocolate.\n\nThe second part of the statement \"Muffins might not have been blueberry\" introduces a possibility that contradicts the first conditional statement. It means that even if the cake was chocolate, the muffins could have been some other flavor and not blueberry.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the cake was not chocolate. The statement \"Muffins might not have been blueberry\" does not provide enough evidence to negate the possibility of a chocolate cake.\n\nAnswer: no.",
