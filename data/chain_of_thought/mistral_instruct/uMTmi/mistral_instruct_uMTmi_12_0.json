However, the second statement introduces a possibility that Lucy did not go to the zoo despite Joe having gone to the park.\n\nStep 3: Consider all possible scenarios.\n\nScenario 1: Both Joe and Lucy went to their respective places (park and zoo).\n- This scenario is consistent with both statements.\n\nScenario 2: Joe went to the park, but Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n- This scenario contradicts the first statement but is consistent with the second statement.\n\nStep 4: Determine if we can infer that Joe did not go to the park based on the given information.\n\nThe statements do not allow us to make such a definitive conclusion as they leave open the possibility of Scenario 2, where Joe went to the park but Lucy did not go to the zoo. Therefore, we cannot infer that Joe did not go to the park based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no.",
