It means that under the condition that the apple is red, it follows that the banana is yellow.\n\nStep 3: However, the second statement, \"The banana might not have been yellow,\" introduces a possibility that contradicts the first statement. This creates an inconsistency in the given information.\n\nStep 4: Since we cannot accept both statements at the same time due to their inherent contradiction, it is impossible to make a definitive conclusion about the color of the apple based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
