In this case, the first event is Lisa buying the red shirt, and the second event is Mark buying the blue shirt.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possibilities.\n\nWe know that Lisa bought the red shirt. However, we cannot be certain if Mark bought the blue shirt based on the given information alone. The conditional statement only tells us that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt \u2013 it does not guarantee that both events occurred.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the inference.\n\nThe question asks if we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt based on the given information. No, we cannot make this inference. The fact that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt does not affect the certainty of Lisa buying the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no.",
