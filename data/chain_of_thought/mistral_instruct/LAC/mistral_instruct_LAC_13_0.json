It only states that the truck is blue. The first statement establishes a conditional relationship between the colors of the car and the truck. However, it doesn't guarantee that both conditions (car being red and truck being blue) are true at the same time.\n\nStep 3: Consider possible scenarios\n\nScenario 1: The car is red, and the truck is blue. In this case, both statements are true.\nScenario 2: The car is not red (it could be any other color), and the truck is blue. In this case, the first statement is false, but the second statement is still true.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the logical inference\n\nSince the second statement does not provide enough information to determine the color of the car, we cannot logically infer 'The car was red' based on the given statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
