We have two conditional statements:\n   a) If p (the book was written by James), then q (the book is a mystery novel).\n   b) Q (the book is a mystery novel).\n\n2. To determine if we can infer p (the book was written by James) from q (the book is a mystery novel), we need to apply the rule of Modus Ponens:\n   If p implies q and q is true, then p must be true.\n\n3. In this case, we have p implied by q, and q is given as a fact. So, we can apply Modus Ponens and infer that p (the book was written by James) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
