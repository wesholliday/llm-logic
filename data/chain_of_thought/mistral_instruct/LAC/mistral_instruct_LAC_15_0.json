This is known as the chain rule in logic, which states that if we have two conditional statements A -> B and B -> C, then we can infer A -> C. In this case, A represents Sam taking a plane, B represents Erin taking a train, and C represents nothing specified. However, since Erin took a train according to the second statement, we can conclude that Sam took a plane as well, given the first statement.",
