However, it does not guarantee that the first part is actually true.\n2. \"The wolf was in the den\": This statement is true, but it doesn't provide any information about the bear or its location.\n3. To infer that \"The bear was in the cave,\" we would need to have a reason to believe that the initial condition (bear in the cave) is true based on the given information. However, there is no such evidence presented in these statements.\n4. Therefore, even though the wolf being in the den does not contradict the possibility of the bear being in the cave, it doesn't provide enough information to logically infer that the bear was indeed in the cave.\n\nAnswer: No.",
