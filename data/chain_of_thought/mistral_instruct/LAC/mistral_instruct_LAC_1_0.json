            "content": " Answer: Yes. The first statement, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true. The second statement, \"Sue was at the wedding,\" tells us that the consequence of the first statement is indeed true. Therefore, based on these two statements, we can logically infer that Mary was also at the wedding because the condition of the first statement (Mary being there) must be true for the consequence (Sue being there) to hold.",
