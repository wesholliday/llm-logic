However, it does not guarantee that Lisa actually bought the red shirt; it only establishes a relationship between her potential purchase and Mark's purchase.\n\n2. \"Mark bought the blue shirt\": This statement is true, indicating that Mark indeed made a purchase of the blue shirt.\n\n3. To infer that \"Lisa bought the red shirt,\" we would need to know that her condition (buying the red shirt) was met. However, the given statements do not guarantee this; they only establish a relationship between Lisa's potential purchase and Mark's actual purchase.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, we cannot logically infer that \"Lisa bought the red shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
