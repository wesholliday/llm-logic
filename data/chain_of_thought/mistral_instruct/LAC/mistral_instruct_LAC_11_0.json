The muffins were blueberry.\n\nTo determine if we can logically infer that \"The cake was chocolate,\" let's reason through it step by step:\n\n1. We know that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry.\n2. We also know that the muffins are blueberry.\n3. However, this statement about the muffins does not provide any information about the cake. It only tells us what type of muffins there are.\n4.
