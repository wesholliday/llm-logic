If p (Jeff plays basketball), then q (Amy plays tennis).\n2. q (Amy played tennis) is a fact.\n\nWe want to know if we can infer p (Jeff played basketball).\n\nUsing the given information, we have a conditional statement and a fact. To determine if we can infer p, we need to check if q implies p:\n\n1. If q (Amy played tennis), then what can we say about p (Jeff played basketball)?\n2. The given information does not provide any direct relationship between Amy playing tennis and Jeff playing basketball.\n3. Therefore, just knowing that Amy played tennis does not logically imply that Jeff played basketball.\n\nAnswer: no.",
