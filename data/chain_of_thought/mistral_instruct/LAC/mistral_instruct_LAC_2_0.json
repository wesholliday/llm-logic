'The unicorn was in the forest': This statement is a fact. It tells us that a unicorn exists in the forest.\n2. 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest': This conditional statement means that if a griffin (which we know does not exist) were in the forest, then a unicorn would also be present.\n3. To infer 'The griffin was in the forest' from these statements, we need to apply the rule of Modus Ponens: If A implies B and A is true, then B must be true. However, since A (the griffin being in the forest) is not a given fact but rather an implication from another statement, this rule cannot be directly applied here.\n4. Therefore, we cannot logically infer 'The griffin was in the forest' based on these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
