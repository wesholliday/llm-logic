We have two conditional statements: If p (Joe went to the park), then q (Lucy went to the zoo); and q (Lucy went to the zoo).\n2. To determine if we can infer p (Joe went to the park) from q (Lucy went to the zoo), we need to apply the rule of Modus Ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement \"If p, then q\" and we know that q is true, then we can infer that p is also true.\n3. However, in this case, we don't have direct knowledge of p (Joe went to the park), but rather the conditional statement \"If p, then q.\"\n4. To apply Modus Ponens, we need to ensure that the antecedent of the conditional statement is true. In other words, we need to know that Joe went to the park (p) in order to infer that Lucy went to the zoo (q).\n5. Since we don't have direct knowledge of p, we cannot apply Modus Ponens directly and infer that \"Joe went to the park\" based on \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
