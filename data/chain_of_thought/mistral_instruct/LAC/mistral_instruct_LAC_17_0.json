If Ben ate pasta (P), then Kate ate salad (S). This is a conditional statement.\n2. Kate ate salad (S). This is an observational fact.\n\nTo infer \"Ben ate pasta\" (P) from these statements, we need to apply the rules of logical reasoning:\n\n1. From a conditional statement \"If P then Q,\" and an observation that Q is true, we can logically infer that P is also true. This is known as the Modus Ponens rule.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we can apply the Modus Ponens rule to infer that Ben ate pasta (P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
