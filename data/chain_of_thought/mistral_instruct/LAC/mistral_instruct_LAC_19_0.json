We have two conditional statements:\n   a) If Tom watches football, then Jen watches basketball (If p, then q).\n   b) Jen watched basketball (q).\n\n2. To determine if we can infer that Tom watched football based on these statements, we need to apply the rules of logical implication:\n\n   a) From 'p' implies 'q', and 'q', we can infer 'p'. This is known as the rule of Modus Ponens.\n\n3. In our case, 'p' represents \"Tom watched football,\" and 'q' represents \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\n4. Since we have both 'q' (Jen watched basketball) and the conditional statement \"If p, then q\" (If Tom watches football, then Jen watches basketball), we can apply the rule of Modus Ponens to infer that 'p' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
