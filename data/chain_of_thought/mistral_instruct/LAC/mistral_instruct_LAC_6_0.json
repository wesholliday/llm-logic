We have two conditional statements:\n   a) If Sue chooses pizza, then Bob chooses pasta (Let's call this statement A).\n   b) Bob chooses pasta (Let's call this statement B).\n\n2. To determine if we can infer \"Sue chose pizza\" from these statements, let's consider the following possibilities:\n\n   a) If Sue did not choose pizza, then according to statement A, Bob would not have chosen pasta. However, we know that Bob did choose pasta (statement B), so Sue must have chosen pizza. This is called the \"contrapositive\" of statement A and is a valid form of logical reasoning.\n\n   b) If Sue chose pizza, then according to statement A, Bob would have chosen pasta. We already know that Bob did choose pasta (statement B), so this scenario is consistent with our given statements.\n\n3. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can logically infer that \"Sue chose pizza.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
