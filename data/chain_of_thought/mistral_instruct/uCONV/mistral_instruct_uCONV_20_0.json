It states that under certain conditions (if the apple is red), then another condition (the banana being yellow) follows.\n\nStep 3: Consider the reverse implication\n\nThe question asks if we can infer that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red. This is the reverse of the original statement.\n\nStep 4: Understand the difference between a conditional statement and its converse\n\nA conditional statement (if p then q) is not equivalent to its converse (if q then p), unless p and q are logically equivalent. In other words, just because one condition implies another, it does not necessarily mean that the reverse implication is also true.\n\nStep 5: Apply this understanding to the given statement\n\nThe original statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" does not imply that \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\" Therefore, we cannot infer that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no.",
