It means that when Joe goes to the park, Lucy goes to the zoo as a result.\n\nStep 3: Consider the reverse conditional statement\n\nThe question asks whether we can infer \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park.\" This is the reverse of the original if-then statement.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the reverse conditional statement based on the given information\n\nSince the original statement describes a causal relationship from Joe going to the park to Lucy going to the zoo, it does not follow that the reverse statement is true. In other words, just because Lucy went to the zoo doesn't mean that Joe went to the park. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park.\"\n\nStep 5: Write the answer\n\nAnswer: no.",
