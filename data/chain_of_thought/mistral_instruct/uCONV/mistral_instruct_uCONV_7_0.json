We know that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This is stated in the question.\n2. However, the reverse of this statement may not be true. Just because Chris finished the race does not necessarily mean that Alex finished the race as well. They could have finished at different times or even in different races altogether.\n3. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that if Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: no.",
