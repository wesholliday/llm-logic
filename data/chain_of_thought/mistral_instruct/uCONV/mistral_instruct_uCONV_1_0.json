The first statement tells us that Mary's presence implies Sue's presence at the wedding.\n2. However, the second statement asks for the reverse implication, i.e., Sue's presence implying Mary's presence.\n3. Just because one event (Mary being present) implies another event (Sue being present), it does not necessarily mean that the reverse implication is also true.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding based on the given information alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
