However, it does not necessarily mean that the reverse condition (truck being metal) implies the first condition (doll being plastic).\n\nStep 3: In other words, just because we know that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal, it doesn't automatically follow that if the truck is metal, then the doll must be plastic. There could be other possibilities as well.\n\nAnswer: No.",
