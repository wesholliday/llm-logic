In this case, the given statement is true, and the reverse implication is also true.\n\nScenario B: Mark buys the blue shirt first, but Lisa doesn't buy the red shirt. In this scenario, the given statement is not true, and the reverse implication is false.\n\nStep 4: Determine the answer based on the analysis\n\nSince Scenario B shows that the reverse implication can be false, we cannot infer that \"if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt\" is always true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no.",
