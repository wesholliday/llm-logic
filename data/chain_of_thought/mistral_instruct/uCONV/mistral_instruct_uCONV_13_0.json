It does not necessarily mean that there is a reverse conditional relationship.\n\nStep 3: In order to determine if we can infer that if the truck was blue, then the car was red, we would need to have additional information indicating a reciprocal conditional relationship between the colors of the car and the truck.\n\nStep 4: Since no such information has been provided, we cannot make this inference based on the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
