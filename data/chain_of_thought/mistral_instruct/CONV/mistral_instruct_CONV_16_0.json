If the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim (given). However, just knowing that the pants are denim does not necessarily mean that the shirt is cotton. It could be that the pants are denim and the shirt is made of a different material, such as silk or wool. Therefore, the reverse conditional statement \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton\" does not follow logically from the given conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: no.",
