It means that if the first condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the second condition (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that the reverse is also true - \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt\". This statement would mean that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa must have bought the red shirt before or at the same time.\n\nWithout further information, we cannot be certain that this is the case. It's possible that Lisa and Mark both bought their shirts independently of each other, in which case the reverse condition would not hold true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement alone, we cannot infer that \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt\".\n\nAnswer: no.",
