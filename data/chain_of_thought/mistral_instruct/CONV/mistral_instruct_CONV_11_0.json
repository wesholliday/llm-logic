Here, P represents \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q represents \"the muffins were blueberry\".\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given statement\n\nThis statement does not allow us to infer that \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate\". The reason is that just because one condition (P) implies another condition (Q), it doesn't necessarily mean that Q implies P. In other words, the implication is not symmetric.\n\nStep 3: Conclude\n\nAnswer: no.",
