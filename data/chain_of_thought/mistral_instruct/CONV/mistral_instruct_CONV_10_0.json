It states that if one condition (the dog being inside) is true, then another condition (the cat being outside) must also be true.\n\nStep 3: Consider the reverse implication\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside,\" we need to consider the reverse implication of the original statement.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the reverse implication based on the given information\n\nThe given statement does not provide enough information to establish the reverse implication as true. The fact that the dog being inside implies the cat being outside does not necessarily mean that the cat being outside implies the dog being inside.\n\nStep 5: Conclusion\n\nAnswer: no.",
