It means that under certain conditions (Sue choosing pizza), we can infer something about Bob's choice (he chose pasta).\n\nStep 2: Consider the reverse implication\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza,\" we need to consider the reverse implication of the original statement. This means asking, \"If Bob chose pasta, what can we infer about Sue's choice?\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the reverse implication\n\nThe reverse implication is not necessarily true based on the given statement. Just because Bob chose pasta when Sue chose pizza does not mean that Sue would always choose pizza when Bob chooses pasta. There could be other factors influencing their choices, such as personal preference or availability of options.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\n\nAnswer: no. We cannot infer \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza\" based on the given statement alone.",
