In this case, the reverse conditional statement holds true.\n\nScenario 2: If the doll is not plastic (let's say it's rubber), but the truck is metal, then the reverse conditional statement does not hold true.\n\nStep 4: Determine the answer based on the given information.\n\nSince we only have the information that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal, we cannot infer that if the truck is metal, then the doll is plastic with certainty. There could be scenarios where this is true (as in Scenario 1), but there are also scenarios where it is not (as in Scenario 2).\n\nAnswer: no.",
