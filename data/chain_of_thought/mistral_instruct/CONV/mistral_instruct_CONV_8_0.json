            "content": " Step 1: Understand the given conditional statement.\n\nThe given conditional statement is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This means that whenever the vampire is awake, it implies that the mummy is also awake at that same time.\n\nStep 2: Consider the reverse conditional statement.\n\nThe reverse conditional statement is \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake.\" This means that whenever the mummy is awake, it implies that the vampire is also awake at that same time.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the given and reverse statements are equivalent.\n\nFor two statements to be equivalent, they must have the same meaning or logical consequence. In this case, for the reverse statement \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake\" to be equivalent to the given statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake,\" both statements must imply the same thing whenever one is true, the other must also be true.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe given statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" implies that the wakefulness of the vampire causes the wakefulness of the mummy. However, the reverse statement \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake\" implies that the wakefulness of the mummy causes the wakefulness of the vampire. These implications are not logically equivalent because causation is not symmetric (one event causing another does not imply the reverse).\n\nStep 5: Conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no.",
