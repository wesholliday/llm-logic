            "content": " Step 1: Understand the given statement\n\nThe given statement is an conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q\". Here, P represents \"the apple was red\" and Q represents \"the banana was yellow\".\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given statement\n\nThe given statement states that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow. This means that the two statements (the apple being red and the banana being yellow) are related but not necessarily connected in a causal way.\n\nStep 3: Consider the reverse statement\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red\", we need to consider the reverse of the given statement. The reverse statement would be \"If Q, then P\". Here, Q represents \"the banana was yellow\" and P represents \"the apple was red\".\n\nStep 4: Analyze the reverse statement\n\nThe reverse statement is not necessarily true based on the given statement alone. Just because the apple being red implies the banana being yellow, it does not mean that the banana being yellow implies the apple being red. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red\" from the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
