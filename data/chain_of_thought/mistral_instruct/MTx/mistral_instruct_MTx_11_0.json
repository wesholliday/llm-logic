If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed (conditional statement)\n2. The flug was not zimmed\n\nFirst, we need to understand that a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" implies two things:\n\na) If P is true, then Q must be true.\nb) If P is false, it does not necessarily mean that Q is false.\n\nIn our case, the given statements are:\n\n1. If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed\n2. The flug was not zimmed\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the flug was not zimmed. However, this does not directly contradict statement 1 because the conditional statement only implies that if the flug was blummed, it would have been zimmed as well. It doesn't state that the flug being not zimmed means it wasn't blummed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The flug was not blummed.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
