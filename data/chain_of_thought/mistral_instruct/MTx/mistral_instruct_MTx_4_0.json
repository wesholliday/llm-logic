We have two conditional statements: If p (the fribble was snurgled), then q (the fribble crinked). Not q (the fribble did not crink).\n2. To determine if we can infer that p is false (The fribble was not snurgled) from these two conditional statements, we need to consider the relationship between p and q.\n3. The first conditional statement \"If p, then q\" tells us that whenever p is true, q must be true as well. This is also known as a material implication.\n4. However, the negation of q (Not q) does not necessarily mean that p is false. It only means that if p were true, then q would have to be false.\n5. In this case, since we know that q is false (The fribble did not crink), it does not directly allow us to infer that p is false (The fribble was not snurgled).\n6. To make a definitive conclusion, we would need additional information or context about the relationship between p and q.\n7. Without further information, we cannot infer that \"The fribble was not snurgled\" based on \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\" and \"The fribble did not crink.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
