This is a form of logical reasoning called modus tollens.\n\nStep 3: Apply the logical relationship to the given statements\n\nSince Statement 2 tells us that the sprocket was not daggled, and Statement 1 states that if the sprocket was cranked, then it would be daggled, we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nStep 4: Write the final answer\n\nAnswer: yes.",
