We have two conditional statements: If p (the glip was slogged), then q (the glip was tragged). Not q (the glip was not tragged).\n2. To apply the rules of logic to these statements, we can use a truth table or the contrapositive rule. Let's use the contrapositive rule: If p implies q, then it is also true that if not q, then not p.\n3. Applying this rule to our given statements: If the glip was slogged implies the glip was tragged, and the glip was not tragged, we want to know if it follows that the glip was not slogged.\n4. According to the contrapositive rule, if p implies q, then not q implies not p. In our case, \"the glip was slogged\" is represented by 'p' and \"the glip was tragged\" is represented by 'q'.\n5. So, we have: If p (glip was slogged) implies q (glip was tragged), then not q (glip was not tragged) implies not p (glip was not slogged).\n6. Therefore, based on the given statements, if \"The glip was not tragged,\" it does follow logically that \"The glip was not slogged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
