We have two conditional statements: If p (the smip was shripped), then q (the smip lupped the zoint). Not q (the smip did not lup the zoint).\n2. To apply the law of contradiction, we need to determine if p and Not-p (the smip was not shripped) cannot both be true at the same time.\n3. Let's assume for a moment that the smip was shripped (p is true). According to our first conditional statement, this would mean that the smip lupped the zoint (q is true).\n4. However, we also know that the smip did not lup the zoint (Not-q is true), which contradicts our initial assumption that q is true when p is true.\n5. Since a contradiction has been reached, it means that our initial assumption (p) cannot be true at the same time as Not-p. Therefore, we can infer that \"The smip was not shripped\" (Answer: yes).",
