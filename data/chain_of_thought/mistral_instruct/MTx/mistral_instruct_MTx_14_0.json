We have two conditional statements: If p (the clug was fleeked), then q (the clug snugged).\n2. Not q (the clug did not snugged).\n3. To find out if we can infer not p (the clug was not fleeked), we need to apply the rules of logic for conditional statements:\n   a. If p implies q and not q, then not p is true (this is known as the contrapositive rule).\n4. In our case, we don't have enough information to directly apply the contrapositive rule because we only know that \"if p then q\" and \"not q,\" but we don't know if \"not p implies not q.\"\n5. Without knowing the relationship between \"the clug was not fleeked\" and \"the clug did not snugged,\" it is impossible to infer definitively whether or not \"The clug was not fleeked\" based on the given information alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
