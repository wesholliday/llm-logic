We have two conditional statements: If p (the flugel was blimmed), then q (the flugel was zargled). Not q (the flugel was not zargled).\n2. To apply the law of contradiction, we need to ensure that both conditions cannot be true at the same time. In other words, if p is false, then q must also be false.\n3. Let's assume for a moment that the flugel was blimmed (p is true). According to our first conditional statement, this would imply that the flugel was zargled (q is true).\n4. However, we have been given that the flugel was not zargled (not q is true). This creates a contradiction because both q and not q cannot be true at the same time.\n5. To resolve this contradiction, we must conclude that our initial assumption (p) was false, meaning the flugel was not blimmed.\n6. Therefore, from \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled\" and \"The flugel was not zargled,\" we can infer \"The flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
