We have two conditional statements: If p (zinger was fraggled) then q (zinger was smoogled), and not q (zinger was not smoogled).\n2. To apply the law of contrapositive, we need to transform the given conditional statements into their equivalent forms. The contrapositive of \"If p then q\" is \"If not q then not p.\"\n3. Applying this rule to our given statements: If not smoogled (q) then not fraggled (p), and not smoogled (q).\n4. Since we have the second part of the contrapositive statement, \"not smoogled,\" it holds true.\n5. However, having \"not smoogled\" does not necessarily mean that \"not fraggled\" is also true. The two statements are related but not equivalent.\n6. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The zinger was not fraggled\" just from \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\" and \"The zinger was not smoogled.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
