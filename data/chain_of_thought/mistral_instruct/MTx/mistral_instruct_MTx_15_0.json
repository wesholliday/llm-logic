We have two conditional statements: If p (the dreb was vroombed), then q (the dreb was spened).\n2. Not q (the dreb was not spened).\n3. To determine if we can infer not p (the dreb was not vroombed), we need to apply the rules of logic for conditional statements:\n   a. If p implies q, and not q is true, then p cannot be true (this is known as the law of contradiction).\n4. In our case, if \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\" implies that \"The dreb was spened,\" and \"The dreb was not spened\" is true, then \"The dreb was not vroombed\" must be true to avoid a contradiction.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that \"The dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
