If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink. (Statement 1)\n2. The grommet did not plop the frink. (Statement 2)\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of Statement 2:\n- If the grommet plopped the frink, then it was not sploffed (because Statement 1 tells us that if the grommet is sploffed, it will plop the frink).\n\nHowever, we don't know for sure that the grommet never plopped the frink; Statement 2 only tells us that it did not do so at some point in time relevant to the given context.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer 'The grommet was not sploffed' with certainty. We can only conclude that if the grommet plopped the frink, then it was not sploffed at that moment. But we don't know whether or not the grommet was ever sploffed in the past or will be sploffed in the future.\n\nAnswer: no.",
