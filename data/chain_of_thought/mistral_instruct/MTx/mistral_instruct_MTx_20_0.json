We have two conditional statements: \"If P (the fleeg was bluttered), then Q (it surned)\" and \"Not-Q (the fleeg did not surn).\"\n2. To apply the rules of logic to these statements, we need to convert them into their equivalent forms using the contrapositive and negation of a conditional statement.\n3. The contrapositive of \"If P then Q\" is \"If Not-Q then Not-P.\" In our case, this would be \"If it did not surn (Not-Q), then it was not bluttered (Not-P).\"\n4. Since we also have the statement \"The fleeg did not surn (Not-Q),\" we can use this and the contrapositive to infer \"It was not bluttered (Not-P).\"\n5. Therefore, yes, we can infer that \"The fleeg was not bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
