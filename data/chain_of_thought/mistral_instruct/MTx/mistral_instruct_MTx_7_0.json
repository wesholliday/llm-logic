If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked. (This statement implies that when a whiffle is shanked, it produces a tink sound.)\n2. The whiffle did not tink. (This statement means that there was no tink sound produced when the whiffle was hit or shanked.)\n\nNow let's consider the possible implications of these statements:\n\n1. If 'The whiffle did not tink' is true, then it directly contradicts 'If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked'. Since a contradiction implies that neither statement can be true at the same time, we can infer that 'The whiffle was not shanked'.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
