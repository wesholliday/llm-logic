We have two conditional statements: If p (the shank was plooked), then q (the shank was nugged). Not q (the shank was not nugged).\n2. To determine if we can infer not-p (the shank was not plooked) from these statements, we need to consider the relationship between p and q.\n3. The first statement tells us that if the shank is plooked, then it is nugged. This is a conditional statement, meaning it does not necessarily mean that every time the shank is plooked, it is also nugged. It only means that whenever the shank is plooked, it is also nugged.\n4. The second statement tells us that the shank was not nugged. This means that at least one instance exists where the shank was not nugged.\n5. However, we cannot directly infer from these statements that the shank was never plooked, only that there is at least one instance where it was not nugged.\n6. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer \"The shank was not plooked.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
