We have two conditional statements: If P (wug was flooped) then Q (wug bimmed the zoint), and not Q (wug did not bim the zoint).\n2. To apply the law of contradiction, we need to consider the implications of both P and not-P (the negation of P) together.\n3. If P is true, then Q must be true according to the first conditional statement. However, if Q is false (as stated in the second conditional), then P cannot be true at the same time because the truth of P would imply the falsity of not-Q (wug did not bim the zoint).\n4. Therefore, since we know that not-Q is true, it follows that P must be false.\n5. In other words, if \"The wug did not bim the zoint\" is a fact, then \"The wug was flooped\" cannot be a fact.\n6. So, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The wug was not flooped.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
