We have two conditional statements: If p (plinked) then q (varnished), and not q (not varnished).\n2. To apply the law of contradiction, we need to show that p and not-p cannot both be true at the same time.\n3. In this case, if \"The twonk was plinked\" were true, then according to the first statement, it would have to be varnished (q).\n4. However, we know from the second statement that \"The twonk was not varnished\" (not-q), which contradicts the first statement's implication.\n5. Therefore, since p and not-p cannot both be true at the same time, it must be that \"The twonk was not plinked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes.",
