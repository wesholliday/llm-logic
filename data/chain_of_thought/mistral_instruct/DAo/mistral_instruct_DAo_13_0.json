We know that \"The car was not red.\"\n2. We also know that \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\"\n3. However, we don't have any information about the color of the car being anything other than not red.\n4. Since the given condition \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement, it only applies when the premise (the car being red) is true.\n5. In this case, since we know that the car is not red, the condition does not apply.\n6. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the color of the truck based on the given information alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
