We know that Joe did not go to the park.\n2. The second statement says that if Joe had gone to the park, then Lucy would have gone to the zoo.\n3. However, since we know that Joe didn't go to the park, it follows that Lucy didn't go to the zoo according to the given condition. But this inference is based on the assumption that the conditional statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is always true.\n4. Without further information, we cannot be certain that the conditional statement is always true. It could be a one-time occurrence or an exception might exist.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information alone, we cannot infer \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\" with absolute certainty.\n\nAnswer: no.",
