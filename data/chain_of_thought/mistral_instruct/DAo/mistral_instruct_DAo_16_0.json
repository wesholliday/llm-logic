We know that \"The shirt was not cotton.\"\n2. We also know that \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\"\n3. However, we don't have any information about whether or not the shirt is actually made of another material and the pants are denim.\n4. The given conditional statement only tells us that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim; it doesn't guarantee that the shirt is cotton or that the pants are denim when the shirt isn't cotton.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The pants were not denim\" based on the given information alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
