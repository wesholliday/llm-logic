We know that 'Jeff did not play basketball'.\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis'.\n3. This conditional statement tells us that if the first part (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the second part (Amy playing tennis) must also be true.\n4. However, we know that the first part is false (Jeff did not play basketball).\n5. Since the conditional statement is only valid when the first part is true, it does not apply in this case.\n6. Therefore, the fact that Jeff did not play basketball does not necessarily mean that Amy did not play tennis.\n\nAnswer: no.",
