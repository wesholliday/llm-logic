            "content": " To answer this question, let's use the rules of logical reasoning:\n\n1. We have two statements: Mary was not at the wedding (M) and If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (I -> S).\n2. To determine if we can infer 'Sue was not at the wedding' from these statements, we need to consider the relationship between M and I -> S using logical reasoning.\n3. Since M states that Mary was not at the wedding, it contradicts the hypothesis in I that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was there.\n4. A contradiction means that neither statement can be true at the same time, so we cannot assume both M and I -> S are true.\n5. Therefore, to maintain logical consistency, one of the statements must be false.\n6. Since we know that M is true (Mary was not at the wedding), it follows that I -> S must be false, meaning Sue was not necessarily at the wedding if Mary was not there.\n7. However, this does not directly imply that Sue was not at the wedding; it only means that her presence cannot be inferred from Mary's absence.\n8. To infer 'Sue was not at the wedding', we would need an additional statement that explicitly states she wasn't there or proves her absence through logical reasoning.\n9. Since no such statement has been provided, we cannot make this conclusion based on the given information alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
