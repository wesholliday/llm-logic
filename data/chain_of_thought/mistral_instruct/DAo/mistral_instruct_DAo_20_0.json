The apple was not red.\n2. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nFrom these statements, we cannot directly infer that \"The banana was not yellow.\" Here's why:\n\nThe first statement tells us that the apple is not red. The second statement creates a conditional relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana. It states that if the apple were red, then the banana would be yellow. However, we know that the apple is not red, but we don't have any information about the actual color of the banana.\n\nTherefore, even though it's possible that the banana could be yellow based on the given conditions, we cannot definitively infer that it is not yellow without additional information.\n\nAnswer: no.",
