We know that \"The dog was not inside.\"\n2. We also know that \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\"\n3. However, we don't have any information about the actual location of the cat. It could be either inside or outside the house.\n4. To infer that \"The cat was not outside,\" we would need to have the contradictory statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was not outside.\" But we do not have this statement.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The cat was not outside.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
