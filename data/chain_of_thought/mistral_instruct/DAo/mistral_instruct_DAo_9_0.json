We know that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n2. The second statement tells us that if Lisa had bought the red shirt, then Mark would have bought the blue shirt.\n3. However, since we know that Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, this condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is not met.\n4. Therefore, even though the statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" tells us something about what would have happened if Lisa had bought the red shirt, it doesn't actually tell us anything about what really happened in this situation (i.e., whether or not Mark bought the blue shirt).\n5. Without further information, we cannot definitively infer that \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
