If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n\nStep 2: Analyze each statement independently.\n\nStatement 1: The bear was not in the cave. This means that the bear is not present in the cave at the given moment.\n\nStatement 2: If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. This is a conditional statement. It states that if the condition (bear being in the cave) is true, then the consequence (wolf being in the den) is also true.\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of both statements together.\n\nSince Statement 1 says that the bear was not in the cave, the condition of Statement 2 is false. Therefore, the consequence of Statement 2 cannot be true. However, we cannot directly infer that the wolf was not in the den based on these given statements alone. The statements only tell us that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den, but they do not guarantee that the bear was actually in the cave.\n\nStep 4: Summarize and answer the question.\n\nWe cannot infer 'The wolf was not in the den' based on the given statements alone. The statements only provide information about the relationship between the bear being in the cave and the wolf being in the den, but they do not definitively establish that either condition is true or false.\n\nAnswer: no.",
