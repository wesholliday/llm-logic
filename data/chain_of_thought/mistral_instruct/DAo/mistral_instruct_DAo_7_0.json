We also know that \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\"\n3. However, just because Alex didn't finish the race doesn't necessarily mean that Chris didn't finish as well. The second statement only tells us that if Alex finished, then Chris did too, but it doesn't guarantee that they both finished or that Chris even raced at all.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"Chris did not finish the race.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
