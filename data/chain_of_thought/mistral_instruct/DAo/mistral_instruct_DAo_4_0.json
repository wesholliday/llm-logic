The alien did not visit Mars.\n2. If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nFrom these statements alone, we cannot infer that \"The robot did not visit Jupiter.\" Here's why:\n\nFirst, let's consider the conditional statement \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\" This means that if the antecedent (alien visiting Mars) is true, then the consequent (robot visiting Jupiter) must also be true. However, it does not necessarily mean that if the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot could not have visited Jupiter. The two events are independent of each other in this context.\n\nTherefore, even though we know that the alien did not visit Mars, we cannot infer for certain that the robot did not visit Jupiter based on the given information alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
