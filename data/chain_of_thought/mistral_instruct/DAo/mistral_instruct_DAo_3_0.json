However, the second statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" implies that if James wrote the book, it would be a mystery novel. Since we know that James did not write the book, we can infer that the book must be something other than a mystery novel. Therefore, the answer is 'Answer: yes, The book is not a mystery novel.'",
