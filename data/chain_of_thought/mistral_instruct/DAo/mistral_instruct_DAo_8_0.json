We know that \"The vampire was not awake.\"\n2. We also know that \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n3. However, we don't have any information about the actual state of the mummy.\n4. To infer that \"The mummy was not awake,\" we would need to have additional information or a premise that states \"If the vampire is not awake, then the mummy is not awake.\"\n5. Without this additional information, we cannot make that inference based on the given statements alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
