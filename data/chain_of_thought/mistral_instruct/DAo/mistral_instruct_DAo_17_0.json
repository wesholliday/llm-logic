We know that Ben did not eat pasta.\n2. The conditional statement is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\"\n3. This means that if Ben had eaten pasta, we would know that Kate ate salad.\n4. However, since Ben didn't eat pasta, the condition in the conditional statement doesn't apply.\n5. Therefore, the fact that Ben didn't eat pasta does not allow us to make any definitive conclusions about what Kate did or didn't eat based on the given information alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
