Sue did not choose pizza.\n2. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot directly infer that \"Bob did not choose pasta.\" Here's why:\n\nThe first statement tells us that Sue made a different choice than pizza. The second statement creates a conditional relationship between Sue's and Bob's choices \u2013 if Sue chose pizza, then Bob would have chosen pasta. However, we know that Sue didn't choose pizza, but we don't know whether or not Bob actually did choose pasta.\n\nTherefore, the given information is not sufficient to infer that \"Bob did not choose pasta.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
