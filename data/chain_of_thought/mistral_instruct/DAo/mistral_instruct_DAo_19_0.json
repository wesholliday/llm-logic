We know that Tom did not watch football.\n2. The conditional statement is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\"\n3. Since Tom didn't watch football, the condition in the if statement doesn't hold true (Tom didn't do the part that triggers Jen to watch basketball).\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer that Jen watched basketball based on the given information.\n5. To infer that \"Jen did not watch basketball,\" we would need an additional piece of information stating that she didn't watch basketball or a contradictory condition like \"If Tom watched football, then Jen didn't watch basketball.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
