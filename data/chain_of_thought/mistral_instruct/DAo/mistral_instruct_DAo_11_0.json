We know that \"The cake was not chocolate.\"\n2. We also know that \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\"\n3. However, we don't have any information about whether the cake is actually any other type or if it's just not chocolate.\n4. Therefore, even though we know the cake isn't chocolate, we cannot directly infer that the muffins aren't blueberry based on this information alone.\n5. To make such an inference, we would need to have additional information that confirms or denies the statement \"The muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
