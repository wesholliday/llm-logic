In this case, if the car is red, then the truck is blue.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the truck is indeed blue. However, it does not provide any information about the color of the car.\n\nStep 3: Apply logical reasoning\n\nTo determine whether we can logically deduce 'The car was red' from the given statements, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The car is red and the truck is blue (satisfies both conditions).\nScenario 2: The car is not red but the truck is blue (violates the first condition).\n\nSince Statement 2 only tells us about the color of the truck, it does not provide enough information to determine the color of the car based on the given conditional statement. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce 'The car was red' from the given statements.\n\nStep 4: Write the answer\n\nAnswer: no.",
