However, it does not guarantee that the apple is actually red.\n2. \"The banana was yellow\": This statement is true and confirms the second part of the conditional statement.\n3. To logically deduce that \"The apple was red,\" we would need to know that the first part of the conditional statement (the apple being red) is also true. But we don't have any information confirming this, so we cannot make that assumption based on the given statements alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
