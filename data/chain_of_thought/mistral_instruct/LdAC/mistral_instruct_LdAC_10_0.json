In this case, if the dog is inside, then the cat must be outside.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the cat was outside.\n\nStep 3: Apply logical reasoning\n\nTo determine if we can logically deduce 'The dog was inside' from the given statements, we need to consider both statements together and see if they allow for any other possibilities besides 'The dog was inside'.\n\nSince Statement 2 tells us that the cat was outside, and Statement 1 states that if the dog is inside, then the cat must be outside, it follows that the dog cannot be inside based on the information given.\n\nStep 4: Provide final answer\n\nAnswer: no. The statements do not allow for the logical deduction of 'The dog was inside'.",
