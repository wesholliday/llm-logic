We have two conditional statements:\n   a) If p (the book was written by James), then q (the book is a mystery novel).\n   b) Q (the book is a mystery novel).\n\n2. To determine if we can deduce p (the book was written by James) from the given information, we need to apply the rule of Modus Ponens:\n   If p implies q and q is true, then p must be true.\n\n3. In this case, we have q (the book is a mystery novel), and we want to deduce p (the book was written by James). We also know that p implies q.\n\n4. However, we don't have any information about the truth value of p itself. So, based on the given information alone, we cannot logically deduce \"The book was written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
