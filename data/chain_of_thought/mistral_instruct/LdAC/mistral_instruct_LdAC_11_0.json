However, Statement 2 only tells us that the muffins were blueberry. It does not provide any information about the cake.\n\nStep 3: Consider the logical implications of the statements\n\nThe conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" implies two things:\n1. If P is true, then Q must be true.\n2. If P is false, then Q can be either true or false.\n\nIn our case, P represents \"the cake is chocolate,\" and Q represents \"the muffins are blueberry.\" Since Statement 2 tells us that Q is true (the muffins were blueberry), it does not necessarily mean that P is also true (the cake was chocolate). The conditional statement only tells us that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. It does not guarantee that the cake actually is chocolate.\n\nStep 4: Determine the answer\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot logically deduce \"The cake was chocolate\" from \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" and \"The muffins were blueberry.\"",
