The second statement informs us that Bob actually chose pasta.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of logic to determine if we can deduce 'Sue chose pizza' from the given statements\n\nTo deduce 'Sue chose pizza', we would need to apply the rule of contrapositive, which states that if 'If P then Q' is a conditional statement, then its contrapositive 'If not Q then not P' is also true. However, in this case, applying the contrapositive would result in 'If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza'. Since we know that Bob did choose pasta, this contradicts the given information and makes it impossible to deduce that Sue chose pizza based on the given statements alone.\n\nStep 4: Provide the final answer\n\nAnswer: no.",
