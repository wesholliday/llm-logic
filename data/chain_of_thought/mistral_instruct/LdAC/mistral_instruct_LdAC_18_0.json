            "content": " Step 1: Understand the given statements\n\nStatement 1: If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\nStatement 2: The truck was metal.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given statements\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement (if-then statement). It states that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. This means that the two statements are related but not necessarily true for all situations.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the truck is metal. However, it does not provide any information about the doll being plastic or not.\n\nStep 3: Consider the logical implications of the given statements\n\nFrom Statement 1 and Statement 2 alone, we cannot logically deduce that the doll is plastic. The conditional statement only tells us that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. It does not guarantee that the doll is always plastic when the truck is metal or vice versa. Therefore, even though we know that the truck is metal, it does not necessarily mean that the doll is plastic.\n\nStep 4: Summarize your reasoning and provide the answer\n\nAnswer: No. From 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' together with 'The truck was metal', we cannot logically deduce 'The doll was plastic'.",
