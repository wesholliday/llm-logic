            "content": " Answer: Yes. The given statements imply that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim. We know that the pants are denim, so by substituting \"denim\" for \"pants\" in the first statement, we get \"if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim,\" which becomes \"if the shirt was cotton, then it was denim.\" However, we know that \"it\" (referring to the pants) is actually denim. Since the conditional statement \"if p then q\" implies that if p is true, then q must also be true, we can logically deduce that the shirt is cotton.",
