If Jeff plays basketball, then Amy plays tennis (P \u2192 Q)\n2. Amy plays tennis (Q)\n\nWe want to know if we can infer that Jeff plays basketball (P).\n\nTo do this, we need to apply the rules of logical implication:\n\n1. A conditional statement P \u2192 Q is true if either P is false or Q is true.\n2. If both P and Q are true, then the conditional statement P \u2192 Q is still true but does not logically imply that P caused Q.\n\nGiven the information provided, we have Q (Amy played tennis). We don't know if P (Jeff played basketball) is true or false. Since we cannot determine the truth value of P based on the given information alone, we cannot logically deduce \"Jeff played basketball\" from \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" and \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
