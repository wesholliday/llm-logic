If p (Lisa bought the red shirt), then q (Mark bought the blue shirt).\n2. q (Mark bought the blue shirt) is a fact.\n\nTo find out if p (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, we need to apply the Modus Ponens rule:\n\nModus Ponens: If p implies q and q is true, then p must be true.\n\nIn our case:\n- p = Lisa bought the red shirt\n- q = Mark bought the blue shirt\n\nGiven that q (Mark bought the blue shirt) is a fact, we can apply Modus Ponens to determine if p (Lisa bought the red shirt) is also true.\n\nSo, let's check the conditions of Modus Ponens:\n1. We have p implies q (If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt).\n2. We have q (Mark bought the blue shirt) as a fact.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can logically deduce that \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
