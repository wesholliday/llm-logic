We have two conditional statements:\n   a) If P (bear is in the cave), then Q (wolf is in the den).\n   b) Q (wolf is in the den).\n\n2. To determine if we can deduce P (bear is in the cave) from these statements, we need to apply the rules of logical implication:\n   a) If P implies Q and Q is true, then P must be true (Modus Ponens rule).\n\n3. In our case, we have P implied by Q, and Q is given as a fact. So, according to the Modus Ponens rule, we can deduce that P (bear is in the cave) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
