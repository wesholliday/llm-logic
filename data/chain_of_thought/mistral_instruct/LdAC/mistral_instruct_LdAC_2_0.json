(Conditional statement)\nStatement 2: The unicorn was in the forest.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given statements to determine if we can logically deduce that the griffin was in the forest.\n\nTo do this, let's consider the conditional statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This statement implies two things:\n\n1. If the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn must also be in the forest. (Forward implication)\n2. If the unicorn is in the forest, then the griffin must also be in the forest. (Converse implication)\n\nHowever, we cannot assume both implications are true based on the given information alone. The statement only tells us that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is; it does not tell us that if the unicorn is in the forest, then the griffin must be.\n\nStep 3: Determine if we can logically deduce 'The griffin was in the forest' based on the given statements.\n\nNo, we cannot logically deduce 'The griffin was in the forest' based on the given statements alone because the conditional statement only implies that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is, but it does not guarantee that if the unicorn is in the forest, then the griffin must be.\n\nAnswer: No.",
