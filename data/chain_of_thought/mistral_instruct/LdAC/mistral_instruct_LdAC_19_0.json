If Tom watches football, then Jen watches basketball (conditional statement).\n2. Jen watched basketball.\n\nTo deduce Tom watched football based on these statements, we need to apply the Modus Ponens rule of inference for conditional statements:\n\nIf \u2203x(P(x) \u2192 Q(x)) and \u2203x(P(x)), then \u2203x(Q(x)).\n\nIn our case, P represents \"Tom watches football\" and Q represents \"Jen watches basketball.\"\n\nLet's check if the conditions for applying Modus Ponens are met:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement: If Tom watches football (P), then Jen watches basketball (Q).\n2. We also have evidence that Jen watched basketball (Q).\n\nNow, we need to determine if Tom watched football (P) based on the given information. To do this, we'll apply Modus Ponens:\n\n1. Given: \u2203x(P(x) \u2192 Q(x)) and \u2203x(P(x)).\n2. To deduce: \u2203x(Q(x) \u2192 P(x)).\n3. Since we want to deduce \"Tom watched football,\" we'll check if the conclusion follows from our given statements using the contrapositive of the conditional statement: If Jen watches basketball (Q), then Tom watches football (P).\n4. To check this, let's assume that Jen watches basketball (Q) and see if it implies Tom watches football (P):\n   - Given: Jen watches basketball (Q).\n   - From the conditional statement: If Tom watches football (P), then Jen watches basketball (Q).\n   - Since we have Q, we can infer P using the given conditional statement.\n5. Therefore, based on our analysis, we can logically deduce \"Tom watched football\" from \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" and \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nAnswer: yes.",
