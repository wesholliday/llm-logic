It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\n2. If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\n\nFirst, let's examine the second statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" This conditional statement means that if we know the doll was plastic, we can infer that the truck must have been metal as well. However, it does not necessarily mean that the doll was actually plastic.\n\nThe first statement \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal\" indicates that the truck could have been another material besides metal. Thus, it is possible for both the doll and the truck to be non-metallic materials like plastic.\n\nSince we cannot infer with certainty that the doll was plastic based on the given statements, and even if she were plastic, it would not definitively prove that the truck was metal, we cannot make the inference \"The doll was not plastic\" from the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No.",

This means there are possibilities other than metal for the truck's material.\n\nStatement 2: If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. This is a conditional statement with two parts - a hypothesis (doll is plastic) and a consequent (truck is metal).\n\nStep 3: Consider their relationship and implications.\n\nSince Statement 1 tells us that the truck doesn't necessarily have to be metal, it contradicts the 'only if' part of Statement 2, which says 'the truck must have been metal'. However, the 'if' part of Statement 2 (doll is plastic) does not directly conflict with any given information.\n\nStep 4: Determine the overall conclusion based on available information.\n\nFrom the given statements alone, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic.
