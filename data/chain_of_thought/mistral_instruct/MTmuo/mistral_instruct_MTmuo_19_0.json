It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. This means that there is a possibility that Jen did not watch basketball.\n2. If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. This statement creates a conditional relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball.\n3. However, we don't know if Tom actually watched football or not. The first statement only tells us that Jen might not have watched basketball.\n4. Without knowing Tom's actions regarding watching football, we cannot definitively infer that \"Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
