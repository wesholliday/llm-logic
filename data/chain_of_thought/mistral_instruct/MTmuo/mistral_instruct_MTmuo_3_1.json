In other words, either P or its negation must be true.\n\nStep 7: Given our conditional statements, we have two possibilities:\n1) \"It's not the case that the book is a mystery novel\" is true (let's call this condition A).\n2) \"The book was written by James\" is false (let's call this condition B).\n\nStep 8: We want to find out if both conditions A and B are true at the same time. If they were, then we could infer that \"The book was not written by James.\" However, we know from the Law of Excluded Middle that it is impossible for both a proposition and its negation to be true simultaneously.\n\nStep 9: Let's test this hypothesis by assuming both conditions A and B are true. If they are, then we should be able to logically derive \"The book was not written by James\" from them.\n\nStep 10: However, even if \"It's not the case that the book is a mystery novel,\" we still cannot definitively say that \"The book was not written by James,\" as there might be other authors whose works aren't mystery novels.\n\nStep 11: Based on the information provided in the question, we cannot infer that \"The book was not written by James.\" There might still be other possible explanations for why the book isn't a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: no",

We have two conditional statements:\n   - If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel (A)\n   - It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel (B)\n2. To find out if we can infer \"The book was not written by James\" from A and B, we need to use logic rules to analyze these statements:\n\n3. First, let's consider each statement in isolation:\n   - Statement A: If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel. This is a conditional statement that means if James wrote the book, then it must belong to the category of mystery novels. It does not necessarily mean that James only writes mystery novels or that every book he writes is a mystery; it just means that the condition holds true for this specific book we're discussing.\n   - Statement B: It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel. This statement negates the necessity of the book being a mystery novel, meaning that the book can belong to any other genre.\n4. Now let's consider how these statements relate to each other:\n   - Since A says that if James wrote the book, it must be a mystery novel, and B says it doesn't have to be a mystery, there is a conflict between the two statements. This conflict does not allow us to directly infer \"The book was not written by James\" based on A and B alone.\n5. However, we can use the contrapositive of statement A to help us understand this situation better:\n   - If the book is not a mystery novel, then it was not written by James (contrapositive of statement A)\n6. Based on our analysis, if we know that the book is not a mystery novel, we can infer that James did not write it according to statement A's contrapositive.\n7. In conclusion:\n   - No, we cannot directly infer \"The book was not written by James\" from statements A and B alone. We would need additional information or context to make such an inference. But we can infer that if the book is not a mystery novel, then it was not written by James based on statement A's contrapositive.\n   - Answer: no.",

So, we have:\n\n- It's not the case that [the book was written by James and the book is a mystery novel]\n\nStep 2: The second statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel\" is a conditional statement.\n\n- If [the book was written by James], then [the book is a mystery novel]\n\nStep 3: To determine if we can infer \"The book was not written by James\", we need to apply the rules of logic for combining two statements, specifically the rules for negation and implication. The rules are as follows:\n\n1. The negation of a statement is true when the statement is false, and false when the statement is true.\n2. If both the premises (statements) of an argument are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n3. If either premise of an argument is false, then the conclusion may or may not be true.\n4. The negation of a conditional statement (if-then statement) is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the consequent of the original statement.\n\nStep 4: In our case, we have two statements:\n\n1. It's not the case that [the book was written by James and the book is a mystery novel]\n2. If [the book was written by James], then [the book is a mystery novel]\n\nTo combine these statements, we need to negate the second statement and compare it with the first statement. The negation of \"If [the book was written by James], then [the book is a mystery novel]\" would be \"It's not the case that [the book was written by James implies the book is a mystery novel]\".\n\nStep 5: We can compare the original two statements as follows:\n\n1. It's not the case that [the book was written by James and the book is a mystery novel]\n2. It's not the case that [the book was written by James implies the book is a mystery novel]\n\nSince both statements are negations of conditional statements with the same condition (the book being written by James), they have the same meaning if their hypotheses and consequents are interchanged.
