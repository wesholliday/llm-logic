It's not the case that the cat must have been outside.\n2. If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\n\nFirst, let's consider the second statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\" This conditional statement tells us that if the dog is inside, then the cat cannot be inside as well (they must be outside).\n\nNow, let's consider the first statement: \"It's not the case that the cat must have been outside.\" This statement does not necessarily mean that the cat was inside but only that it wasn't a requirement for the cat to be outside.\n\nGiven these statements, we cannot directly infer that \"The dog was not inside\" because the first statement leaves open the possibility that both animals could have been outside or even inside (just not together). However, since the second statement tells us that if the dog is inside, then the cat must be outside, and the first statement does not contradict this, we can infer that \"The dog and cat were not both inside.\"\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot directly infer \"The dog was not inside,\" but we can infer \"The dog and cat were not both inside.\"",
