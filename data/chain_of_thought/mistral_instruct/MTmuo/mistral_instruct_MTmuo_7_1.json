It says that if Alex finished the race, then Chris also finished the race.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given statements for logical consistency.\n\nThe first statement does not guarantee that Chris did not finish the race; it only says he might not have. The second statement, on the other hand, states a condition where if Alex finished, Chris must have as well.\n\nStep 3: Determine if we can infer 'Alex did not finish the race'.\n\nSince we cannot definitively conclude that Chris finished or didn't finish the race from the first statement, and the second statement only tells us that if Alex finished, Chris did too, we don't have enough information to deduce 'Alex did not finish the race'. The statements do not contradict each other, so it is possible for both conditions to be true.\n\nAnswer: No.",

However, from Statement 1, we know that 'it's not the case that Chris must have finished the race'.\n\nStep 4: A contradiction arises when combining these statements. Therefore, one of them must be false. Since Statement 2 is a conditional statement, it can potentially be false if its antecedent (Alex finishing) is true but its consequent (Chris finishing) is false. In this case, let's assume that 'Alex finished the race' is true for now.\n\nStep 5: If Alex finished and Chris didn't, then Statement 2 would be false. Therefore, based on our assumptions, it seems that 'Alex did not finish the race' might be a valid inference.

This creates a contradiction.\n\nStep 4: Explore the alternative possibility of Alex not finishing the race.\n\nIf Alex didn't finish the race, then the second statement (which assumes Alex finishes) becomes irrelevant, and the first statement remains true since Chris might not have finished the race either.\n\nTherefore, the given information does not allow us to infer that 'Alex did not finish the race.'
