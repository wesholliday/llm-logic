If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot directly infer that 'The vampire was not awake'. Here's why:\n\nThe first statement tells us that it is not necessary for the mummy to be awake. The second statement establishes a conditional relationship between the vampire and the mummy \u2013 if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake. However, this does not mean that the vampire being awake is a certainty; it only means that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy will also be awake as a consequence.\n\nTherefore, even though we know that the mummy doesn't have to be awake and that the vampire's wakefulness implies the mummy's wakefulness, we cannot definitively conclude that 'The vampire was not awake' based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
