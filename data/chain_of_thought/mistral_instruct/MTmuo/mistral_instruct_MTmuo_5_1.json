In order to understand its implications, we need to consider two possibilities:\n\n1) P is true and Q is true (both statements are true).\n2) P is true and Q is false (one statement is true, the other is false).\n\nStep 3: Determining the relationship between Amy playing tennis and Jeff playing basketball\n\nLet's assume that Jeff did not play basketball. In this case, Statement 2 would be false because 'If Jeff played basketball' is false, and 'Amy must have played tennis' follows from a false statement. However, since Statement 1 tells us that it's not the case that Amy must have played tennis, both Statements 1 and 2 cannot be true at the same time.\n\nSo, in order for our assumption to be consistent with all given information, Jeff's not playing basketball (P being false) must make Statement 2 false by making 'Amy must have played tennis' untrue. In other words, when Jeff doesn't play basketball, Amy is free to not have played tennis as well.\n\nStep 4: Final answer\n\nAnswer: yes. Based on the given statements, if we infer that Jeff did not play basketball, then both 'It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis' and 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis' can be consistent with each other.",
