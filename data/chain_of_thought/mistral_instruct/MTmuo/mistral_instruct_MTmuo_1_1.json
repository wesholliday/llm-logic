If Mary is present, Sue must be as well.\n\nStep 3: Combining statements and analyzing implications\n\nThe first statement informs us that Sue's presence at the wedding is not a necessity (\"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding\"), while the second statement indicates a necessary relationship between Mary and Sue being present if Mary attends the wedding (\"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\").\n\nStep 4: Identifying conflicting information\n\nSince the first statement states that Sue might not be present at the wedding, but the second statement implies that she would have to be if Mary is, there is a clear conflict between these two statements.\n\nStep 5: Inferring missing information and reaching a conclusion\n\nGiven this conflict, it's impossible to infer definitive answers from the given information alone. We cannot conclude with certainty that \"Mary was not at the wedding,\" nor can we determine with absolute certainty that she was present. The given statements create a contradiction and do not provide enough evidence to make an informed conclusion about Mary or Sue's attendance at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no.",

But based on Statement 1, we know that Sue could have been absent.
