This does not necessarily mean that Joe always goes to the park or that he went to the park on a specific occasion. It only establishes a relationship between their actions.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the given statements in relation to each other\n\nSince Statement 1 states that Lucy did not go to the zoo, it contradicts Statement 2 if we assume that Joe went to the park. Therefore, for the given statements to be consistent, Joe cannot have gone to the park.\n\nStep 5: Provide the final answer\n\nAnswer: yes, Joe did not go to the park.",
