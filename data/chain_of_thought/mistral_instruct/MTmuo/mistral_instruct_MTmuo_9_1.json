This means that there are possibilities where Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n2. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This is a conditional statement, which means that it sets out a rule that applies only if the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is met.\n\nNow let's consider whether we can infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt' from these statements:\n\nFirstly, the two statements do not directly contradict each other. The first statement says that Mark may not have bought the blue shirt, while the second statement sets out a condition where Mark must buy the blue shirt if Lisa buys the red shirt. If Lisa does not buy the red shirt, then this condition is not met, and we cannot make any conclusions about Mark's actions based on these statements alone.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'Answer: no'.",

From these statements alone, we cannot infer that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" The second statement indicates a necessary condition for Mark buying the blue shirt, but it does not preclude other possibilities where both or neither of them bought the shirts. If Lisa did buy the red shirt and Mark didn't buy the blue shirt, then both conditions would still be met (Mark not having to buy the blue shirt, and Lisa buying the red shirt implying Mark buys the blue).\n\nAnswer: No.",

This does not necessarily mean that Lisa has bought the red shirt; it only tells us what would happen in that hypothetical scenario.\n\nStep 2: Analyzing the relationship between statements\n\nThe given information states that Mark's buying the blue shirt is not guaranteed, and a separate statement suggests that if Lisa buys the red shirt, then Mark will buy the blue shirt. Neither statement provides definitive proof that Lisa has bought or hasn't bought the red shirt.\n\nStep 3: Determining if we can infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt' based on the available information\n\nFrom the given statements, we cannot directly infer that 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt'. The conditional statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt', does not ensure that Lisa actually bought the red shirt. So, even if Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, it wouldn't necessarily mean Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: no.",

It does not say anything about Lisa's actions or her shirt color.\n\nStatement 2 forms a conditional statement, stating that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. However, it does not guarantee that Lisa actually bought the red shirt. This is a separate condition from statement 1.\n\nStep 3: Considering both statements together.\n\nThe combination of statements 1 and 2 does not directly allow us to infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Statement 2 implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt, but it doesn't prevent her from also buying the red shirt herself. Alternatively, she could have bought a different color or even no shirt at all.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\n\nAnswer: no.",

It's possible that neither Lisa nor Mark bought the blue or red shirts. In this case, both A and B would be true, but C would be false.\n   b.

Lisa did not buy the red shirt, so Mark didn't have to buy the blue shirt (satisfies both statements).\n2. Lisa bought the red shirt, which would make it necessary for Mark to buy the blue shirt (violates Statement 1 but satisfies Statement 2).\n3.

If Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, then Mark still might or might not have bought the blue shirt (as stated in Statement 1). In this case, both Statements are consistent with each other.\n2. However, if Lisa did buy the red shirt, then according to Statement 2, Mark must have bought the blue shirt as well. In this scenario, both statements do not hold simultaneously because Statement 1 states that it's possible for Mark not to have bought the blue shirt.\n\nSince we cannot make 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt' a logical conclusion based on the given statements while maintaining their consistency, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no.",

This situation is consistent with the information given because the statements don't force us to conclude that either Lisa or Mark has bought either color shirt.\n\nScenario B: Lisa bought the red shirt, and therefore, according to statement 2, Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nStep 4: Determine whether 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt' can be inferred from the given statements\n\nThe information provided doesn't allow us to infer 'Lisa didn't buy the red shirt' with certainty since it doesn't contradict any of the given statements.
