The second statement implies that \"the wolf must have been in the den\" if the bear is in the cave.\n\nSince they contradict each other, we cannot accept both statements as true simultaneously.

In this context, let's assume statement 2 is the false or problematic one since it depends on an 'if-then' relationship between two unrelated events.\n\nGiven that we believe statement 1 is true (the wolf was not in the den when the bear wasn't there), the second statement should be modified as follows: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf could have been in the den.\" This revised statement no longer contradicts statement 1 and makes both statements mutually consistent.\n\nHowever, even if the two statements are consistent, we still cannot directly infer that \"The bear was not in the cave\" from them.
