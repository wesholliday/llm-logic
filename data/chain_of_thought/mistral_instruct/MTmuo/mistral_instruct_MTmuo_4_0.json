This means that the robot might or might not have visited Jupiter.\n\nStatement 2 establishes a conditional relationship between the alien visiting Mars and the robot visiting Jupiter. It does not guarantee that both events occurred, only that if one event happened (alien visiting Mars), then the other event must also have happened (robot visiting Jupiter).\n\nStep 3: Consider the combination of statements\n\nThe given statements do not allow us to infer that 'The alien did not visit Mars'. The first statement does not rule out the possibility of the robot or the alien visiting Jupiter, and the second statement only establishes a relationship between the two events.\n\nAnswer: no.",
