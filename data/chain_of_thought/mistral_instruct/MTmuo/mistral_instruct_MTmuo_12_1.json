Let's break down each statement and assess their implications:\n\n1. It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo (this is a negated conditional). In other words, it's possible that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n2. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo (a conditional statement). This means that if we know Joe went to the park, we can be sure that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nNow let's consider whether these statements allow us to infer \"Joe did not go to the park\":\n\nFirst, we cannot directly infer that \"Joe did not go to the park\" based on statement 1 alone (\"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo\"). This is because the first statement only tells us that it's possible for Lucy not to have gone to the zoo. It doesn't give us any information about Joe.\n\nSecond, we cannot directly infer \"Joe did not go to the park\" based on statement 2 alone (\"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo\"). This is because this conditional statement sets up a causal relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo. It doesn't tell us anything about whether or not Joe actually did go to the park.\n\nTo determine if \"Joe did not go to the park\" can be inferred from both statements, we need to consider their combined implications:\n\n1. Statement 1 tells us that it's possible for Lucy not to have gone to the zoo (but it doesn't say anything about Joe).\n2. Statement 2 tells us that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nBased on these statements alone, we cannot definitively conclude \"Joe did not go to the park.\" This is because we don't know for sure whether or not Joe actually went to the park \u2013 statement 2 only tells us what would be true if he did. If we had additional information that contradicted either of these statements or established a conflict between them, then we might be able to make such an inference.
