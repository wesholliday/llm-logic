'It's not the case that the mummy was awake' means the mummy was not awake.\n2. 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake' is a conditional statement. It says if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would also have to be awake.\n3. However, it does not say that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire must have been awake. So, the truth of one statement does not necessarily imply the truth or falsehood of the other.\n4. In order to infer 'The vampire was not awake', we would need an additional piece of information that contradicts the hypothesis. For example, if we knew 'The vampire was in a coffin and sealed tightly, with no signs of life'. That would be sufficient evidence to conclude 'The vampire was not awake'.\n5.
