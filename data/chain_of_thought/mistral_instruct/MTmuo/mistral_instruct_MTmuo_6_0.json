The second statement sets up a conditional relationship where if Sue chooses pizza, then Bob must choose pasta. However, it does not state that Sue chose pizza or that Bob's choice is dependent on Sue's choice.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possibility of both statements being true\n\nIf both statements are true, it means that Bob did not have to choose pasta, but if Sue chooses pizza, then Bob must choose pasta. This creates a contradiction because it suggests that there are two possible outcomes for Bob's choice \u2013 he can either choose pasta or not \u2013 which cannot both be true at the same time.\n\nStep 4: Determine if we can infer 'Sue did not choose pizza' based on the given statements\n\nSince the statements create a contradiction, it is impossible to determine for certain whether Sue did or did not choose pizza based on the information provided. However, since the first statement implies that Bob did not have to choose pasta, it is also possible that Sue chose something other than pizza, which would allow both statements to be true without creating a contradiction.\n\nStep 5: Provide the final answer\n\nAnswer: no, we cannot infer 'Sue did not choose pizza' based on the given statements alone.",
