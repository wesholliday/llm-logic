The second statement establishes a conditional relationship where if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue would also have been there. However, it does not guarantee that Mary actually attended the wedding.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possibility of both statements being true\n\nIf both statements are true, it means that Sue was not at the wedding based on Statement 1, but if Mary had been present, then Sue would have been there as well according to Statement 2. This creates a contradiction since we cannot have both Sue not being at the wedding and her being there when Mary is present.\n\nStep 4: Infer the negation of one statement based on the other (if possible)\n\nSince having both statements true leads to a contradiction, it suggests that one of them must be false. In this case, let's consider the negation of Statement 2: 'If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not there either.'\n\nStep 5: Check if the negation of Statement 2 is consistent with Statement 1\n\nThe negation of Statement 2 is consistent with Statement 1 because both statements suggest that Sue was not present at the wedding under different conditions.\n\nStep 6: Infer the negation of Statement 2 as the answer\n\nSince the negation of Statement 2 is consistent with Statement 1 and does not lead to a contradiction, we can infer 'Mary was not at the wedding' as the answer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
