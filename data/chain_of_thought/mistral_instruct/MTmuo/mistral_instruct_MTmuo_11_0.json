It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry. This statement means that there is a possibility that the muffins were not blueberry.\n2. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry. This conditional statement tells us that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would have had to be blueberry.\n3. However, we cannot directly infer that the cake was not chocolate based on these statements alone. The reason is that both statements make assumptions about different things (the muffins and the cake), and they don't necessarily contradict each other. It's possible for the cake to be something other than chocolate and for the muffins not to be blueberry.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The cake was not chocolate\" based on the given statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
