The second statement tells us that if Lisa buys the red shirt, then Mark must buy the blue shirt. However, we don't know whether or not Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nStep 4: Determine what can be inferred based on the given information\n\nSince we cannot definitively say that Lisa did not buy the red shirt (as there is no information provided about her actions), we cannot infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no.",
