However, it does not necessarily mean that the apple is red or that the banana is always yellow when the apple is red.\n3. To infer \"The apple was not red,\" we would need to know that both statements are true and that there is no other possibility for the banana's color and the apple's color. However, since \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow\" leaves open the possibility that the banana could have been another color, we cannot infer \"The apple was not red\" based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
