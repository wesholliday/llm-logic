This statement means that there is at least one scenario where the pants are not denim. So, it's possible for the pants to be made of another material besides denim.\n\nNow, let's analyze the second statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\". This is a conditional statement that describes a relationship between two events or propositions (shirt being cotton and pants being denim). However, it doesn't make any assumptions about whether either proposition is true or false in the actual situation.\n\nSince we cannot infer that both \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim\" and \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\" are true at the same time based on the given information, it's not possible to conclusively determine if \"The shirt was not cotton\" is true.

If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim (This is a conditional statement with an \"if-then\" relationship).\n\nNow let's evaluate the given statements and try to reach a conclusion:\n\n1. The first statement tells us that even if the pants weren't denim, it doesn't mean that the shirt must be anything specific (it can still be any material other than cotton). This leaves room for various possibilities where both the shirt and the pants are not denim.\n2. The second statement introduces a condition, stating that \"if\" the shirt is cotton, \"then\" the pants must be denim.\n3. However, since the first statement has already established that it's not necessary for the pants to be denim, we can infer that the shirt is not necessarily cotton either (because if it were cotton and the pants had to be denim according to the second statement, then both conditions couldn't hold true at the same time).\n4. Therefore, based on the given statements, it seems reasonable to conclude that 'The shirt was not cotton.'\n\nAnswer: yes",
