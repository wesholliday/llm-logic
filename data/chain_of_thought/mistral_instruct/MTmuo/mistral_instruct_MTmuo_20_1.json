It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow. This means the banana could have been another color (possibly ripe or unripe), but we don't know for sure.\n2. If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. This statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that under certain circumstances (if the apple is red), the banana would be yellow.\n\nNow let's analyze if the given statements allow us to infer \"The apple was not red.\"\n\nFor this inference, we need to apply the principle of contradiction: if a statement A is true, then its negation, denoted as \u00acA, is false. In other words, both A and \u00acA cannot be true at the same time.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"The apple was not red,\" let's consider two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The apple is not red\nIn this case, since \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" is a conditional statement, it doesn't imply that the apple is red. As a result, when the apple is not red, we still have the possibility of the banana being yellow (as per the first statement). However, the statements do not force us to conclude that the banana must be yellow under this scenario. In other words, there can exist situations where both 'It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow' and 'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow' are true without implying that the apple is red. Thus, the inference 'The apple was not red' cannot be drawn from these two statements alone based on Scenario 1.\n\nScenario 2: The apple is red\nUnder this scenario, if \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow\" is true (meaning the banana could have been another color), then the statements cannot imply 'The apple was not red.' Since we know that 'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow', when the apple is indeed red, this condition would be satisfied, and there's no reason to contradict it.

The second statement creates a condition under which the banana would have to be yellow if the apple is red.\n\nHowever, since we know from statement 1 that there's a possibility that the banana was not yellow, it's inconsistent for both statements to hold true at the same time because they make opposing statements about the color of the banana. If statement 2 were true (implying the banana is yellow when the apple is red), then statement 1 would be false.\n\nStep 4: Determine if 'The apple was not red' can be inferred based on the given statements.\n\nSince it appears that we cannot have both statements being true at the same time, and since statement 2 implies an apple color of red leading to a banana color of yellow - which contradicts statement 1's potential for the banana not being yellow - it seems reasonable to infer from these statements that 'The apple was not red'.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
