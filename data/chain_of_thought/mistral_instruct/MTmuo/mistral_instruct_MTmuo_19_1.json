First, we need to understand that \"it's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball\" means that there is a possibility that Jen did not watch basketball. It does not necessarily mean that she definitely did not watch it.\n2. The second statement tells us that if Tom watches football, then Jen must watch basketball. This is an implication - if the premise (Tom watches football) is true, then the conclusion (Jen watches basketball) must be true as well.\n3. However, we already know from the first statement that it's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. This means that there is at least one scenario where Tom watches football but Jen does not watch basketball.\n4. Since the second statement implies that if Tom watches football, then Jen must watch basketball, but we have found a counterexample where this is not true, the second statement cannot be universally true.\n5. Therefore, it's possible for Tom to have watched football and for Jen not to have watched basketball. So, based on the given statements, we cannot infer that \"Tom did not watch football\". Instead, the answer is 'Answer: no'.",

It's possible that she didn't watch it at all.\n\n2. \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\": This is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball. If Tom watches football, then Jen must watch basketball according to this statement.\n\nNow, to infer that \"Tom did not watch football,\" we would need to establish the opposite of the condition stated in point 2: \"If Tom didn't watch football, then Jen didn't have to watch basketball.\" However, based on the information provided, there is no guarantee that this is true. We can't infer that Tom not watching football implies Jen didn't watch basketball because we only know that if Tom watches football, Jen must watch basketball.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer \"Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",

Jen did not necessarily watch basketball\n2. If Tom watches football, then Jen must watch basketball\n\nThe first statement does not dictate that Jen cannot or will not watch basketball. It simply implies that it's not required for her to do so based on the available information.\n\nThe second statement sets up a conditional relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball.

Tom watched football\n2. Tom did not watch football\n\nIf we assume Tom watched football, then according to the second statement, Jen must have watched basketball as well. However, given the first statement stating that Jen is not required to watch basketball, there's a contradiction if we assume both statements are true. This means our initial assumption (Tom watched football) cannot be correct.\n\nStep 4: Apply the logic to arrive at the answer.\n\nSince Tom cannot have watched football given the two statements, we infer that 'Tom did not watch football'.\n\nAnswer: yes (Tom did not watch football).",
