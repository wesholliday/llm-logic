However, Statement 1 tells us that it's not necessary for the truck to be metal. These two statements do not directly contradict each other, but they do seem inconsistent at first glance.\n\nStep 3: Consider possible scenarios\n\nLet's examine some possible scenarios:\n\nScenario A: The doll is plastic and the truck is metal. This scenario satisfies both statements.\nScenario B: The doll is plastic and the truck is not metal. This scenario contradicts Statement 2 but does not directly contradict Statement 1.\n\nStep 4: Determine if a conclusion can be drawn about the doll being plastic or not\n\nSince Statement 2 implies that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal, and Statement 1 states that it's not necessary for the truck to be metal, it seems that the doll cannot be plastic based on these statements alone. However, we cannot definitively conclude 'The doll was not plastic' because there could be other possibilities where both the doll and the truck are not plastic or metal.\n\nStep 5: Provide the answer\n\nAnswer: no.",
