The first statement 'It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel' means that the book can be any genre other than a mystery novel. The second statement 'If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel' means that if James wrote the book, then it would be a mystery novel. These two statements do not directly contradict each other and do not provide enough information to infer that James did not write the book.",
