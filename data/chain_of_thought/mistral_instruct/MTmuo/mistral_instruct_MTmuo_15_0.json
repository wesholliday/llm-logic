The second statement establishes a conditional relationship between Sam's and Erin's actions: if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possibility of Sam taking a plane and its implications on Erin's actions\n\nIf Sam takes a plane, according to statement 2, Erin must take a train. However, we know from statement 1 that Erin is not obligated to take a train. Therefore, this scenario creates a contradiction between the two statements.\n\nStep 4: Determine if it's possible for both statements to be true at the same time\n\nSince there is a contradiction between the two statements, they cannot both be true at the same time.\n\nAnswer: no.",
