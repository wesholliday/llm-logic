This does not mean that the car is definitely red or that the truck is definitely blue; it only establishes a relationship between the two colors.\n\nStep 3: Consider the combination of both statements.\n\nThe first statement (It's not the case that the truck must have been blue) does not contradict Statement 2 (If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue). They address different aspects of the situation. The first statement is about the truck's color being uncertain, while the second statement is about a conditional relationship between the colors of the car and the truck.\n\nStep 4: Determine if we can infer 'The car was not red'.\n\nNo, we cannot directly infer that 'The car was not red' based on the given statements. The statements do not provide enough information to make this conclusion. While it is true that the car being red would imply that the truck is blue (according to Statement 2), it does not mean that the car must be a specific color or that its color can be definitively determined from the available information.",
