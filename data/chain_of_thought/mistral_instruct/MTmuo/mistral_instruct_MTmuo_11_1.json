It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry\n2. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry\n\nFirst, let's consider the meaning of the second statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\" This conditional statement means that if the cake was chocolate, it would imply that the muffins were blueberry. It doesn't actually guarantee that both the cake and muffins are chocolate or blueberry respectively; it just implies a relationship between them (that if cake = chocolate, then muffins = blueberry).\n\nNow, let's consider the first statement: \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\" This statement negates the possibility that muffins were definitely blueberry. It doesn't guarantee that muffins couldn't be any other flavor.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot directly infer \"The cake was not chocolate\" because there is no definite information about the cake's flavor. The only implication we can make from the given statements is that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would have to be blueberry \u2013 but we don't know for sure whether the cake was chocolate or not.\n\nAnswer: No.",
