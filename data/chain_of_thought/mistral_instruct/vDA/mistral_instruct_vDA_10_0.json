Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside (Premise 1).\n2. The dog was not inside (Premise 2).\n3. Therefore, the cat was not outside (Conclusion).\n\nThe conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premises. Here's why:\n\nIf the dog is not inside, it doesn't logically mean that the cat must be outside. The premises only establish a conditional relationship between the dog and the cat being in different locations when the dog is inside. However, if the dog is not inside, the condition does not apply, so we cannot infer that the cat is not outside based on just these two premises alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
