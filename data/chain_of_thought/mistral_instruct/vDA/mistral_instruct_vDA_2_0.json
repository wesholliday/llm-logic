            "content": " To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to apply the rules of logic to its premises and conclusion. Let's examine each premise and the conclusion in turn:\n\n1. If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest (P1)\n2. The griffin was not in the forest (P2)\n3. Therefore, the unicorn was not in the forest (C)\n\nThe argument form is called Modus Tollens. For this form to be logically valid, both of its premises must be true, and if the first premise is true, then the negation of the second premise must follow logically from it. Let's check:\n\n1. P1: If p, then q (Griffin in forest implies Unicorn in forest)\n2. Not P2: Not (Griffin in forest) (Griffin not in forest)\n3. Q: Unicorn not in forest\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to show that if both premises are true, then the conclusion must be true as well. In this case, since P1 states that \"If griffin is in the forest, then unicorn is in the forest,\" and P2 states that \"Griffin is not in the forest,\" it follows logically that the unicorn cannot be in the forest (C). Therefore, if both premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
