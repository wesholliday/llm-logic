Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. If the car was red, then the truck was blue (Premise 1)\n2. The car was not red (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the truck was not blue (Conclusion)\n\nTo understand if this conclusion follows logically from the premises, let's consider a hypothetical scenario:\n\nSuppose Premise 1 is true. That means if the car were red, then the truck would have to be blue according to the argument. Now, let's test Premise 2. If Premise 2 is also true, it implies that the car was not red. Given this information, we can ask ourselves: Does the fact that the car wasn't red imply anything about the color of the truck?\n\nThe answer is no. The premises do not provide enough information to logically deduce that the truck cannot be blue if the car is not red. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no.",
