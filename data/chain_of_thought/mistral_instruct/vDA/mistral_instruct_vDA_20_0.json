            "content": " To determine the logical validity of an argument, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In this case, the argument is as follows:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n2. The apple was not red.\n3. Therefore, the banana was not yellow.\n\nLet's analyze each step:\n\nStep 1: Understanding the premises\nThe first premise is a conditional statement, which means it has an 'if-then' structure. In this case, if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow.\n\nStep 2: Analyzing the second premise\nThe second premise states that the apple was not red.\n\nStep 3: Applying the rules of logic\nSince the first premise is a conditional statement and the second premise negates one of its components (the apple being red), we can apply the rule of contrapositive to test the validity of this argument. The contrapositive of 'If p, then q' is 'If not q, then not p'.\n\nStep 4: Applying the rule of contrapositive to our argument\nThe given argument is: If apple is red, then banana is yellow. Apple is not red. Therefore, banana is not yellow.\n\nTo form the contrapositive, we negate both parts of the original conditional statement:\n\n1'. If banana is not yellow, then apple is not red.\n2'. Apple is not red.\n\nNow, we can check if the conclusion follows from the premises in the contrapositive form:\n\nFrom 1' and 2', we have 'Banana is not yellow' (conclusion).\n\nStep 5: Verifying the logical validity of the argument\nSince the conclusion follows logically from the premises in the contrapositive form, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
