If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt (Premise 1)\n2. Lisa did not buy the red shirt (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Mark did not buy the blue shirt (Conclusion)\n\nFirst, let's check if the premises are logically consistent with each other. If Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, then the first premise doesn't apply since its conditional statement relies on Lisa buying the red shirt. Therefore, the argument does not follow a valid logical form.\n\nAnswer: no.",
