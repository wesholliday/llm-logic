            "content": " To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to apply the rules of logic to its premises and conclusion. Let's break down each part of the argument:\n\n1. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo (P1)\n2. Joe did not go to the park (P2)\n3. Therefore, Lucy did not go to the zoo (C)\n\nThe given argument is in the form of a conditional statement followed by its contrapositive and a conclusion that follows from it. To check if this argument is logically valid, we need to determine if the conclusion can be logically deduced from the premises using the rules of logic.\n\nFirst, let's examine the given premises:\n\n1. If P (Joe went to the park), then Q (Lucy went to the zoo) (P1)\n2. Not-P (Joe did not go to the park) (P2)\n\nNow, we need to determine if it is possible for both premises to be true at the same time. If P1 is true, then Q must be true whenever P is true. However, P2 states that P is false. Since P and Q are related through a conditional statement (P1), if P is false, then we cannot make any definitive conclusions about Q based on P alone.\n\nTo check the validity of the argument, let's assume the truth of the premises and see if the conclusion follows logically:\n\n1. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo (P1)\n2. Joe did not go to the park (P2)\n3. Therefore, Lucy did not go to the zoo (C)\n\nSince P2 states that Joe did not go to the park, we cannot directly determine if Q is true or false based on P1 alone. However, since P2 states that P is false, and P implies Q, it follows that if P is false, then Q could also be false. Therefore, the argument does not necessarily follow logically from its premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
