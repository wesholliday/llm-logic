Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal (Premise 1)\n2. The doll was not plastic (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the truck was not metal (Conclusion)\n\nThe conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premises. Here's why:\n\nEven if the doll is not plastic, it doesn't mean that the truck cannot be metal. The premises do not establish a relationship between the doll and the truck being of opposite materials. Therefore, having the doll not being plastic does not logically imply that the truck is not metal.\n\nAnswer: no.",
