            "content": " To determine the logical validity of an argument, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In this case, the argument is:\n\n1. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n2. The shirt was not cotton.\n3. Therefore, the pants were not denim.\n\nLet's analyze each step:\n\nStep 1: Understanding the premises\nThe first premise is a conditional statement that asserts a relationship between two propositions (the material of the shirt and the material of the pants). The second premise negates the antecedent (shirt being cotton) of the first premise.\n\nStep 2: Determining the truth value of the premises\nThe second premise is true because we know that the shirt was not cotton. However, the truth value of the first premise depends on whether the statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is always true or not.\n\nStep 3: Evaluating the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion\nThe argument's validity hinges on the conditional statement in the first premise being a biconditional statement (i.e., if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim, and if the pants are not denim, then the shirt is not cotton). If it is not a biconditional statement, then the argument can be invalid.\n\nStep 4: Determining the logical validity of the argument\nSince we don't have enough information to know whether the first premise is a biconditional statement or not, we cannot definitively say whether the argument is logically valid or not based on the given information alone.\n\nAnswer: It is indeterminate without more context.",
