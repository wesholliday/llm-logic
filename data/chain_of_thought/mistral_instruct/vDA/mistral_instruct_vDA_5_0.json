            "content": " To determine the logical validity of an argument, we need to check if it adheres to the rules of logic. In this case, we can use the method of truth tables to analyze the given argument.\n\nFirst, let's represent the premises and conclusion in propositional logic:\n\n1. If Jeff plays basketball (P), then Amy plays tennis (Q): P \u2192 Q\n2. Jeff does not play basketball (~P)\n3. Conclusion: Amy does not play tennis (~Q)\n\nNow, let's construct a truth table for this argument:\n\n| P | Q | ~P | ~Q | (P \u2192 Q) | ~P \u2192 ~Q |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| T | T | F | F | T | T |\n| T | F | F | T | F | T |\n| F | T | T | F | F | F |\n| F | F | T | T | T | T |\n\nThe last column represents the conclusion (P \u2192 Q) and its corresponding conditional statement (~P \u2192 ~Q). We can see that whenever the premises are false, the conclusion is true. Therefore, this argument form is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
