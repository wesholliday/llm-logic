In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true as well.\n\nLet's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel (Premise 1).\n2. The book was not written by James (Premise 2).\n3. Therefore, the book is not a mystery novel (Conclusion).\n\nTo test for logical validity, we can use the method of contradiction: assume that the conclusion is false and see if it leads to a contradiction with the premises.\n\nAssume that the book is a mystery novel (despite the conclusion saying otherwise). This means that Premise 1 is true since the book being a mystery novel follows from James having written it. However, Premise 2 states that James did not write the book, which contradicts our assumption that the book is a mystery novel based on Premise 1.\n\nSince our assumption led to a contradiction, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
