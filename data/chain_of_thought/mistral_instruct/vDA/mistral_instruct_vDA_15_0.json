            "content": " To determine the logical validity of the given argument, we need to apply the rules of logic to its premises and conclusion. Let's break down each part of the argument:\n\n1. If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train (Premise 1)\n2. Sam did not take a plane (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Erin did not take a train (Conclusion)\n\nThe given argument is an example of a conditional statement, specifically a material conditional. In order to evaluate its logical validity, we can use the following truth table:\n\n| Sam took a plane | Erin took a train |\n|---|---|\n| False  |   |\n|   | True or False |\n\nSince Premise 2 states that 'Sam did not take a plane' is true, we can fill in the truth table as follows:\n\n| Sam took a plane | Erin took a train |\n|---|---|\n| False  |   |\n\nNow let's evaluate the conclusion. Since Premise 1 tells us that 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train', we can infer that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train as well. This is because the material conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is logically equivalent to its contrapositive 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nTherefore, based on our evaluation of the truth table and the logical equivalence between the original premise and its contrapositive, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
