            "content": " To determine the logical validity of an argument, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In this case, the argument is:\n\n1. If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n2. Tom did not watch football.\n3. Therefore, Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nLet's analyze each step:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement (if-then statement). It establishes a relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball.\n2. The second premise states that Tom did not watch football.\n3. The conclusion denies that Jen watched basketball based on the given information about Tom.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether it's possible for both premises to be true and the conclusion false. In other words, can Tom not watching football be true while Jen watching basketball is false?\n\nLet's test this by assuming that both premises are true:\n\n1. Tom did not watch football (premise 2).\n2. If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball (premise 1).\n\nSince the first premise states that if Tom watches football, Jen watches basketball, and we know Tom didn't watch football, it follows logically that Jen didn't watch basketball as well. This is because the condition (Tom watching football) did not occur, so the consequence (Jen watching basketball) cannot hold either.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
