If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n2. The vampire was not awake.\n3. Therefore, the mummy was not awake.\n\nThe argument is not logically valid. Here's why:\n\nThe first premise states that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is awake. However, the second premise asserts that the vampire is not awake. But we cannot infer from this that the mummy must also be asleep or not awake. The truth value of the conclusion (mummy being awake or not) depends on information outside of the given premises. Therefore, the argument does not follow logically from its premises.\n\nAnswer: no.",
