Spending implies an exchange of something for money or value.\n\nStatement 2 presents a disjunction (or), meaning one of the two statements must be true, but not necessarily both. The first part of the disjunction is \"the dreb is spended,\" and since we know from Statement 1 that it's not spent, this part is false.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the second part of the disjunction can be inferred\n\nSince Statement 2 presents a disjunction, and one part has been proven false, it doesn't automatically mean the other part is true. However, we do know that one of the two statements must be true based on the disjunction. In this case, if \"the dreb is spended\" is false, then \"the dreb is vroombed\" could still be false or true. We cannot infer that it's true without more information.\n\nStep 4: Summarize the conclusion\n\nAnswer: no.",
