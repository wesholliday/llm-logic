The first statement only tells us that the grommet is not plopped, but we don't know what happened to it instead (it could be sploffed or something else). The second statement gives us two possibilities for the grommet's fate, but it doesn't eliminate any other possibilities. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the grommet is sploffed based on this information alone. Answer: no.",
