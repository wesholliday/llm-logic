Therefore, the fact that one statement negates the other condition does not necessarily mean they cannot both be true at the same time.\n\nStep 4: Consider the meaning of 'either' in Statement 2\n\nThe word 'either' in Statement 2 indicates an exclusive disjunction, meaning only one of the conditions can be true at a given time. However, since we know that Statement 1 is true (the smonk is not plagged), and Statement 2b presents a different condition (vreebled), it does not follow logically that Statement 2b must also be true.\n\nStep 5: Conclusion\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot infer that 'The smonk is vreebled' from 'The smonk is not plagged' and 'Either the smonk is plagged or it is vreebled.'\n\nAnswer: no.",
