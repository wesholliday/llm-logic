This means that at least one of the two possibilities must be true. However, we know that the first statement is not true, which is that \"The shank is not nugged.\"\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications\n\nSince the first statement is not true, it cannot be the case that the shank is not nugged and also not plooked at the same time because the second statement states that one of these two must be true. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that \"The shank is plooked.\"\n\nStep 4: Conclude\n\nAnswer: yes.",
