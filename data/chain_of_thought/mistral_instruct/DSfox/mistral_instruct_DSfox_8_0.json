Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked.\n\nStep 2: Analyze each statement separately\n\nStatement 1: The sprocket is not daggled. This means that the sprocket is in good condition and not damaged.\n\nStatement 2: Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked. This statement sets up a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true. However, we don't know which one is true based on the given information alone.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possibilities\n\nSince Statement 1 tells us that the sprocket is not daggled, it follows that if the sprocket were cranked, then it would not be daggled. Therefore, the statement \"The sprocket is cranked\" cannot be inferred directly from the given statements. However, we also know that one of the two conditions in Statement 2 must be true. Since we have already established that the sprocket is not daggled, it follows that the other condition, \"The sprocket is cranked,\" must be true as well.\n\nStep 4: Summarize the answer\n\nTherefore, while we cannot directly infer that \"The sprocket is cranked\" from the given statements, we can conclude that it must be true based on the logical disjunction in Statement 2 and the fact that the sprocket is not daggled.\n\nAnswer: yes (the sprocket is cranked).",
