Either the flug is zimmed or it is blummed.\n\nStep 2: Analyze each statement separately.\n\nStatement 1: The flug is not zimmed. This means that the state of the flug being zimmed is false.\n\nStatement 2: Either the flug is zimmed or it is blummed. This statement sets up two mutually exclusive possibilities for the state of the flug. If the flug were zimmed, then this statement would be true. However, we know from Statement 1 that the flug is not zimmed. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the flug is blummed.\n\nStep 3: Combine the information to reach a conclusion.\n\nSince Statement 1 tells us that the flug is not zimmed and Statement 2 tells us that if the flug is not zimmed, then it must be blummed, we can infer that 'The flug is blummed'.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
