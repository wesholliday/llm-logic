If Statement 1 is true, then Statement 2 must be false. Conversely, if Statement 2 is true, then Statement 1 must be false.\n\nStep 3: Determine which statement is more likely to be true based on the given information.\n\nSince Statement 1 was given first and it contradicts Statement 2, it's reasonable to assume that Statement 1 is the correct one. However, we cannot definitively conclude that 'The sneg is crampled' is false without additional information.\n\nStep 4: Provide an answer based on the available information.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The sneg is crampled' from the given statements alone. We can only determine that 'The sneg is not sproted'.",
