This means that no one has stepped on or crushed the glip.\n\nStatement 2 presents a disjunction, which means \"either...or\". It suggests that there are only two possibilities for the state of the glip: it can be either trampled (crushed) or slogged (whatever that might mean).\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of both statements together\n\nSince Statement 1 states that the glip is not trampled, and Statement 2 suggests that the only other possibility for the glip's state is being slogged, it seems reasonable to infer that the glip must be slogged. However, we cannot make this conclusion definitively because the meaning of \"slogged\" is unclear in this context.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\n\nAnswer: no, we cannot infer 'The glip is slogged' with certainty based on the given information alone.",
