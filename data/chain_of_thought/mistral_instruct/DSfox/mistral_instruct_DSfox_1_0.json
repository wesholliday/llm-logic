Therefore, the statement \"Either the flugel is zargled or it is blimmed\" implies that if the flugel is not zargled (as stated in Statement 1), then it must be blimmed.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the given statements\n\nSince we have determined that if \"The flugel is not zargled,\" then it must be \"blimmed\" (based on Statement 2), our final answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes, The flugel is blimmed.",
