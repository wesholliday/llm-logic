This means that the action 'lupping' is not performed on the smip.\n\nStatement 2 is a disjunction, which means it consists of two mutually exclusive statements joined by 'or'. In this case, the two statements are \"the smip is lupped\" and \"the smip is shripped\". Since these statements are mutually exclusive, they cannot both be true at the same time.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possibilities based on the given statements\n\nSince Statement 1 states that the smip is not lupped, it follows that the first part of Statement 2, \"the smip is lupped\", must be false. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that \"the smip is shripped\" is true.\n\nStep 4: Provide the final answer\n\nAnswer: yes",
