Surname refers to a family name, so this means that the fleeg does not have a family name.\n\nStatement 2 presents us with two possibilities for the state of the fleeg: it can be surned (have a family name) or bluttered (we don't know what \"bluttered\" means in this context).\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of both statements\n\nSince Statement 1 tells us that the fleeg does not have a family name, it follows that the fleeg is not surned.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate if we can infer 'The fleeg is bluttered' from the given statements\n\nNo, we cannot infer 'The fleeg is bluttered' from the given statements. Statement 2 only tells us that the fleeg could be either surned or bluttered, but it does not provide enough information to conclude that the fleeg is definitely bluttered based on the other statement.\n\nAnswer: no.",
