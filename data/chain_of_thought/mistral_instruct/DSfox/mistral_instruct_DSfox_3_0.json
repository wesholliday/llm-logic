This means that the condition 'quanked' does not apply to the splat.\n\nStatement 2 presents a disjunction (or) statement, which means that at least one of the conditions must be true. The two conditions are 'the splat is quanked' and 'the splat is morphed'.\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of Statement 1 on Statement 2\n\nSince Statement 1 states that the splat is not quanked, it follows that the first condition in Statement 2 ('the splat is quanked') cannot be true. However, this does not necessarily mean that the second condition ('the splat is morphed') must be true. The statement only tells us that at least one of the conditions must be true, and we have determined that the first condition is false.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the overall implication of Statement 1 on Statement 2\n\nGiven that Statement 1 states that 'The splat is not quanked', and Statement 2 presents a disjunction with two conditions ('the splat is quanked' or 'the splat is morphed'), we cannot infer that 'The splat is morphed' based on the given statements alone. The fact that one condition in Statement 2 is false does not guarantee that the other condition must be true.\n\nAnswer: no.",
