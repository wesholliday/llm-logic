    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

            "content": " Explanation:\n\n1. We are given that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US.\n2. Economists expect Tennessee to add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower.\n3. The statement \"if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will\" suggests that if neither Tennessee nor Georgia adds the most jobs, then Missouri must be the one adding the most jobs.\n4. However, the statement \"Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t\" implies that it is unlikely for Georgia to add the most jobs.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, it's not necessarily true that if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, Missouri will. It's possible that neither Tennessee nor Missouri adds the most jobs, and another state could take the lead in job growth.\n\nAnswer: No.",
