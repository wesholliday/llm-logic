    "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it\u2019s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be. Moreover, it\u2019s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",

Bananas are predicted to come in second place, and oranges are expected to trail behind bananas.\n3. The text states that \"if bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be.\" This means that if neither apples nor bananas are the top sellers, then oranges will take the lead.\n4. However, the text also states that \"it\u2019s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won\u2019t be.\" This implies that apples are expected to outsell bananas and oranges.\n5. Based on this information, it is not necessarily true that if apples aren't the top-selling fruit, oranges will be. It's possible that bananas could take the lead instead.\n\nAnswer: No.",
