    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it\u2019s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn\u2019t get the offer, then if Priya doesn\u2019t, Diego will. Moreover, it\u2019s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn\u2019t get the offer, Diego will?",

            "content": " Explanation:\n\n1. We know that Priya is the most likely candidate to be offered the position.\n2. If Priya doesn't get the offer, then Diego would be the next best option.\n3. However, it's also mentioned that Julian is a longshot and it's \"likely\" Priya will get the offer. This implies that it's not guaranteed that Priya will get the offer, but it's still more likely than Diego getting it.\n4. Therefore, even though if Priya doesn't get the offer, Diego would be the next choice, it's not as certain that Diego will get the offer if Priya doesn't, given that Julian is also in the running and is considered a longshot.\n\nAnswer: No, it's not likely that Diego will get the offer if Priya doesn't. While he would be the next choice, the likelihood of him getting the offer is still relatively low due to Julian being a contender as well.",
