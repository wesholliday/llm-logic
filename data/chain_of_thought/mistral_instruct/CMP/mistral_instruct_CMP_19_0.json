    "user_prompt": "Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don\u2019t increase the most, then if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won\u2019t increase the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?",

            "content": " Explanation:\n\n1. The passage states that rents are expected to increase the most, followed by home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to rise less than both.\n2. It also mentions that if either home prices or rents don't increase the most, then the other one will increase more.\n3. However, the passage explicitly states that \"rents likely will increase the most,\" so it is unlikely that rents won't increase the most.\n4. Therefore, based on the information given in the passage, it's not likely that mortgage rates will increase the most if rents don't increase the most.\n\nAnswer: No.",
