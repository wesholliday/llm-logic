Based on recent polling, the Democrats likely will gain the most new voters, followed by Republicans, with Libertarians trailing distantly. These are the only major parties, so if Republicans don\u2019t gain the most voters, then if Democrats don\u2019t, Libertarians will. Moreover, Democrats likely will gain the most voters and hence Republicans likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will?",

            "content": " Explanation:\n\n1. We are given information about the expected number of new voters for each of the three major political parties: Democrats, Republicans, and Libertarians.\n2. Based on recent polling, it is suggested that Democrats are likely to gain the most new voters, followed by Republicans, with Libertarians trailing distantly.\n3. We are told that if neither Democrats nor Republicans gain the most voters, then Libertarians must.\n4. However, we are also given information that Democrats are likely to gain the most voters and hence Republicans are unlikely to do so.\n5. Therefore, based on this information alone, it does not follow that if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will. In fact, it is more likely that if Democrats don't gain the most voters, then Republicans will.\n\nAnswer: No.",
