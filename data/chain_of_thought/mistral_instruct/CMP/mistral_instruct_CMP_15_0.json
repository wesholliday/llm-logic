    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the stock market, real estate market, and bond market are the primary investment vehicles. According to financial advisors, the stock market likely will see the highest returns this year, followed by real estate, with bonds having significantly lower expected returns. These markets offer the best investment options, so if real estate doesn\u2019t have the highest returns, then if stocks don\u2019t, bonds will. Moreover, stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if stocks don\u2019t have the highest returns, bonds will?",

            "content": " Explanation:\n\n1. The financial advisors suggest that the stock market is expected to have the highest returns this year.\n2. If real estate doesn't have the highest returns, then it follows that bonds would have higher returns since they are the next best investment option according to the financial advisors.\n3. However, the statement also mentions that stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won't. This means that if stocks do indeed have the highest returns, then real estate is less likely to have the highest returns.\n4. Therefore, it does not necessarily follow that if stocks don't have the highest returns, bonds will. It's still possible for both real estate and bonds to have lower returns than stocks.\n\nAnswer: No.",
