    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the Lakers, Warriors, and Celtics have the best odds to win the NBA championship. Based on expert projections, it is most likely the Lakers will win, followed closely by the Warriors, with the Celtics having much lower odds. These are the only top contenders, so if the Warriors don\u2019t win, then if the Lakers don\u2019t win, the Celtics will win. Moreover, it is most likely the Lakers will win and hence that the Warriors won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the Lakers don\u2019t win, the Celtics will?",

It is stated that if neither the Lakers nor the Warriors win, then the Celtics will win.\n3. However, it is also most likely that the Lakers will win, so it's more probable that the Warriors won't win rather than the Lakers not winning and the Celtics winning.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, it's not likely that if the Lakers don't win, the Celtics will.\n\nAnswer: No.",
