    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the main transportation options in a city. According to ridership data, Uber likely will have the most rides this month, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer rides. These are the only major transportation providers, so if Lyft doesn\u2019t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn\u2019t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides. Moreover, Uber likely will give the most rides and hence Lyft likely won\u2019t give the most rides. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Uber doesn\u2019t give the most rides, taxis will?",

            "content": " Explanation:\n\n1. We know that Uber is expected to have the most rides this month based on ridership data.\n2. If Uber does not have the most rides, then Lyft must have more rides than Uber for Lyft to surpass Uber in ridership.\n3. However, we are told that Lyft is unlikely to have the most rides due to Uber's expected dominance based on ridership data.\n4. Therefore, if Uber does not have the most rides, it is more likely that taxis will have the most rides instead of Lyft.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
