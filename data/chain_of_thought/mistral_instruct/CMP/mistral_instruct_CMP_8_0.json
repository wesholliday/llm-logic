    "user_prompt": "Suppose that India, China, and Russia are the world's leading emerging economies. Economists project it's likely India's economy will grow the fastest this year, followed closely by China's, with Russia's growth rate lagging distantly behind. These are by far the biggest emerging economies, so if China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn\u2019t, Russia will be. Moreover, India's economy likely will grow the fastest of these three and hence China's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if India isn\u2019t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be?",

            "content": " Explanation:\n\n1. We are given that India, China, and Russia are the world's leading emerging economies.\n2. Economists project that India's economy is likely to grow the fastest among these three this year.\n3. China's growth rate is projected to be closely behind India's.\n4. Russia's growth rate is projected to lag significantly behind both India and China.\n5. If India's economy does not grow the fastest, then it can only be the case that China or Russia has a faster growth rate.\n6. However, we have been told that China's growth rate is closely behind India's, so it is unlikely that China will have a faster growth rate than India.\n7. Therefore, if India does not grow the fastest among these three economies, then it must be the case that Russia has a faster growth rate.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
