The argument is in the form of a conditional statement, specifically a contrapositive. The contrapositive of 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad' is 'If Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta'.\n\nThe given conclusion, 'If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad', is the same as the contrapositive form of the premise. Since the argument has the same meaning in both its original and contrapositive forms, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
