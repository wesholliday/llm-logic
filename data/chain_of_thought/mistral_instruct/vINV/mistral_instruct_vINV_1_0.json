            "content": " To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to apply the rules of logic to its premises and conclusion. The argument can be represented as follows using conditional statements:\n\nIf Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (Premise 1)\nIf Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding (Conclusion)\n\nTo check if this argument is logically valid, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Convert the conclusion into an equivalent conditional statement: If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding \u2194 If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\n2. Apply the contrapositive rule to Premise 1: If A -> B, then if not-B -> not-A\n3. Compare the conclusion with the result of applying the contrapositive rule to Premise 1:\n   - If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding (Result of applying contrapositive to Premise 1)\n   - If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding (Conclusion)\n4. Since both statements are identical, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
