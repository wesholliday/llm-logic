The argument can be represented as follows using conditional statements:\n\nIf Alex finished the race (P), then Chris finished the race (Q)\nIf Alex did not finish the race (not P), then Chris did not finish the race (not Q)\n\nThe argument is logically valid if and only if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. In other words, if it is impossible for the premise to be true while the conclusion is false.\n\nTo test this, let's consider a possible scenario where both premises are true: If Alex finished the race (P), then Chris finished the race (Q) holds true. Now, since we have established that P implies Q, it follows that if not P (Alex did not finish the race) is true, then not Q (Chris did not finish the race) must also be true to maintain the consistency of our logical structure.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because its conclusion necessarily follows from its premise in all possible scenarios.\n\nAnswer: yes",
