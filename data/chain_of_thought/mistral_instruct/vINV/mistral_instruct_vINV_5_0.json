If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis (Premise)\n2. If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis (Conclusion)\n\nLet's test this argument using a truth table:\n\n| Jeff played basketball | Amy played tennis | If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis | If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| True  |   True  |    True  |      True     |\n| True  |   False |    False  |      False     |\n| False |   True  |    False  |      True     |\n| False |   False |    True   |      True     |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that all rows have the same value for both conditional statements. This means that the argument is logically equivalent, and thus logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
