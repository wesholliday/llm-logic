            "content": " To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to check if its structure conforms to a valid logical form. The argument can be represented as follows using conditional statements:\n\nIf cake is chocolate, then muffins are blueberry.\nIf cake is not chocolate, then muffins are not blueberry.\n\nThis argument form is known as the contrapositive of the original conditional statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If p, then q\" is \"If not q, then not p\". In this case, the original statement is \"If cake is chocolate, then muffins are blueberry\", and its contrapositive is \"If muffins are not blueberry, then cake is not chocolate\".\n\nSince the given argument is the contrapositive of the original conditional statement, it is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then both statements are true, and the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
