If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo (Premise 1)\n2. If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo (Conclusion)\n\nTo check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises, we can use the form of argument called contrapositive. The contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nLet's apply this rule to our given argument:\n\n1. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo (Premise 1)\n2. If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park (Contrapositive of Premise 1)\n3. If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo (Conclusion)\n\nSince the contrapositive of Premise 1 is identical to the conclusion, it means that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
