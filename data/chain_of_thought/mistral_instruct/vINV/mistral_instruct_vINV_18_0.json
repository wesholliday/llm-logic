            "content": " To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to apply the rules of logic to its premise and conclusion. Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal (premise)\n2. If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal (conclusion)\n\nFirst, let's negate the premise to create a conditional statement that is equivalent in meaning but with the opposite implications:\n\n1. If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal (negated premise)\n\nNow we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from both the original premise and the negated premise. In other words, does having either the original premise or its negation guarantee that the conclusion is true?\n\nLet's assume the doll is not plastic:\n1. If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal (negated premise)\n\nSince this statement is identical in meaning to the conclusion, it follows logically from both the original premise and its negation that if the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\n\nHowever, just because the argument is valid under a specific assumption (in this case, the doll being not plastic), it doesn't necessarily mean that the argument is always valid regardless of the truth value of its premises. In fact, this form of argument, known as a contrapositive argument, is logically valid in general.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
