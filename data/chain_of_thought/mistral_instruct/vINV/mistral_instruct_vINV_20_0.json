            "content": " To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to check if it follows the rules of logic. Let's break down the argument:\n\n1. Premise: If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n2. Conclusion: If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\n\nFirst, let's analyze each statement separately:\n\n1. The first statement is an if-then statement, also known as a conditional statement. It states that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow. This does not necessarily have to be true or false; it depends on whether both conditions (apple being red and banana being yellow) are true at the same time.\n2. The second statement is another if-then statement. It states that if the apple is not red, then the banana is not yellow. This is called the contrapositive of the first statement. If the original statement is true, then its contrapositive should also be true.\n\nNow let's check if the argument is logically valid by testing the truth of both statements and their relationship:\n\n1. For the argument to be valid, both the original statement and its contrapositive must be true.\n2. If the original statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' is false, then the conclusion 'If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow' can still be true or false depending on whether the second condition (banana being not yellow) is true or false when the first condition (apple not being red) is met.\n3. If the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true. In this case, if 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' is true, then 'If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow' should also be true because they are logically equivalent (contrapositives of true statements are always true).\n\nAnswer: yes. The argument is logically valid if both the original statement and its contrapositive are true. In this case, since we assumed that the original statement is given as a premise, we only need to check if its contrapositive is also true. And since the contrapositive of a true statement is always true, the argument is logically valid.",
