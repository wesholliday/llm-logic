The argument can be represented as follows using conditional statements:\n\nIf A (bear in cave), then B (wolf in den)\nIf Not A (bear not in cave), then Not B (wolf not in den)\n\nTo check for logical validity, we need to apply the rules of logic for the material implication (conditional statement). The material implication states that if P implies Q and Not Q implies Not P, then P implies Not Q is also true. This is known as the contrapositive rule.\n\nApplying this rule to our argument:\n\nIf A (bear in cave), then B (wolf in den)\nIf Not B (wolf not in den), then Not A (bear not in cave)\n\nSince the premises and conclusion have opposite implications, they do not match, and the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no.",
