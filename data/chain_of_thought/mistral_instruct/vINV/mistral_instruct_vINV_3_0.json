            "content": " To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to check if it follows the rules of logic. In other words, we need to make sure that the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\nPremise 1: If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\nPremise 2: If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nConclusion: If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nThe conclusion follows directly from premise 2, so we don't need to use premise 1 in this case. However, let's check if the argument form itself is valid.\n\nTo do that, let's assume for the sake of contradiction that there exists a book such that:\n\n1. James did not write it.\n2. It is a mystery novel.\n\nThis would be a contradiction to premise 2, which states that if James did not write the book, then it cannot be a mystery novel. Therefore, our assumption must be false, and the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
