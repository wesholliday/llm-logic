            "content": " To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to apply the rules of logic to its premise and conclusion. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. (Premise)\n2. The vampire was not awake. (Assumption for contradiction)\n3. Therefore, the mummy was not awake. (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument is attempting to establish a conditional statement in reverse order based on another conditional statement. To evaluate its validity, we can use the rules of logic for contrapositive and inverse statements.\n\nFirst, let's check if the given argument is the contrapositive of the original premise:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. (Original Premise)\n2. If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake. (Contrapositive)\n\nTo check if the second statement is the contrapositive of the first, we need to swap the hypotheses and negate both sides:\n\n1. If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake. (Assume this as a new premise)\n2. The vampire was not awake. (From assumption)\n3. Therefore, the mummy was not awake. (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument is structurally identical to the original one, but with the hypotheses swapped and negated. Since the conclusion follows logically from the premises in this case, it's a valid argument.\n\nAnswer: yes",
