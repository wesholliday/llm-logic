            "content": " To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to apply the rules of logic to its premise and conclusion. The argument can be represented as follows using conditional statements:\n\nIf Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt (Premise)\nIf Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt (Conclusion)\n\nLet's analyze this argument step by step:\n\n1. First, we need to understand that a conditional statement has two parts: the antecedent and the consequent. In our premise, the antecedent is \"Lisa bought the red shirt,\" and the consequent is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n2. The argument's conclusion also consists of two conditional statements with negated antecedents: \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt,\" and \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\n3. To determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to apply the rule of contrapositive, which states that if 'p' implies 'q,' then 'not q' implies 'not p.'\n4. Applying the rule of contrapositive to our premise: If Lisa bought the red shirt (p), then Mark bought the blue shirt (q). According to the rule, this implies that If Mark did not buy the blue shirt (not q), then Lisa did not buy the red shirt (not p).\n5. Now let's compare the conclusion with our premise: The argument's conclusion is \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt (not p), then Mark did not buy the blue shirt (not q).\"\n6. Since the conclusion follows the same logical structure as the contrapositive of the premise, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
