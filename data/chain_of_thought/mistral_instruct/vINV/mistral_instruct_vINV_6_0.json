            "content": " To determine the logical validity of the argument, we need to apply the rules of logic to its given premise and conclusion. Let's assume that Sue's choice is represented by the proposition p (Sue chose pizza), and Bob's choice is represented by the proposition q (Bob chose pasta).\n\nThe given premise can be written as: If p, then q.\n\nThe conclusion can be written as: If not-p, then not-q.\n\nTo check for logical validity, we need to determine if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. We can do this by applying the rule of contrapositive, which states that if 'If p, then q' is a valid conditional statement, then so is 'If not-q, then not-p'.\n\nApplying the rule of contrapositive to the given premise:\n\nIf p, then q\n\nIf not-q, then not-p (contrapositive)\n\nNow we can compare this with the conclusion:\n\nIf not-p, then not-q\n\nSince the conclusion matches the form of the contrapositive of the premise, it follows logically from the premise. Therefore, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
