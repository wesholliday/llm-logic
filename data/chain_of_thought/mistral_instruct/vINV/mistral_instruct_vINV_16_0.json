Let's analyze it using the rules of contrapositive and negation:\n\n1. Given premise: If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n2. Conclusion: If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\n\nFirst, let's check if the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'.\n\n1. Premise: If A (shirt is cotton), then B (pants are denim).\n2. Contrapositive: If not B (pants are not denim), then not A (shirt is not cotton).\n3. Given conclusion: If not A (shirt is not cotton), then not B (pants are not denim).\n\nSince the given conclusion matches the contrapositive of the premise, we can conclude that the argument follows a valid logical form.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
