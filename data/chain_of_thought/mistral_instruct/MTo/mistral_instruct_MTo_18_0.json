In this case, if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. This is not the same as saying that the truck is metal when the doll is plastic; rather, it says that if the doll is plastic, then the truck cannot be metal (it must be something else).\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of the statements for the given question\n\nThe question asks whether we can infer 'The doll was not plastic' from the given statements. To answer this question, let's consider what would need to be true for that inference to hold. Specifically, if the doll were plastic and the truck were not metal, then it would follow that the truck is something other than metal (since the conditional statement says that if the doll is plastic, then the truck cannot be metal). However, we are only given information about what the truck is not (metal), so we don't have enough information to determine what the truck actually is. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The doll was not plastic' based on the given statements alone.\n\nStep 4: Write your answer\n\nAnswer: no.",
