In this case, if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is also in the forest. However, we know that the unicorn is not in the forest from Statement 1.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the given statements allow us to infer 'The griffin was not in the forest'.\n\nSince Statement 1 states that the unicorn was not in the forest and Statement 2 says that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is also in the forest, it follows that the griffin cannot be in the forest because the presence of a griffin would imply the presence of a unicorn, which we know is not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
