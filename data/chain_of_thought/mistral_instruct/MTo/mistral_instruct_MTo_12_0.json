We also know that \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n3. From these two statements, we cannot directly infer that \"Joe did not go to the park,\" because there is a possibility that neither of them went to the zoo or the park.\n4. However, if we assume for the sake of argument that Joe did go to the park, then according to the second statement, Lucy would have had to go to the zoo. But we know from the first statement that Lucy didn't go to the zoo.\n5. Therefore, our assumption that Joe went to the park must be false, and thus \"Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
