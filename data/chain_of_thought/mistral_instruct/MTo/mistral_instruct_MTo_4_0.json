However, we know that the robot did not visit Jupiter. This means that the condition in the second statement (alien visiting Mars) cannot be true because it would lead to a contradiction (robot visiting Jupiter when we know it didn't).\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion can be drawn.\n\nSince the alien visiting Mars leads to a contradiction given the first statement, it is safe to conclude that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
