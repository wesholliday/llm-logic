We know that Bob did not choose pasta.\n2. The second statement tells us that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob would have chosen pasta.\n3. However, we don't have any information about what Sue actually chose. It could be anything other than pizza or pasta.\n4. Since we don't know whether Sue chose pizza or not, we cannot definitively say that \"Sue did not choose pizza\" based on the given statements alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
