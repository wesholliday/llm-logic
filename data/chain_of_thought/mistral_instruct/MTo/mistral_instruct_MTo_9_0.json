It means that under the condition that Lisa bought the red shirt, Mark bought the blue shirt. However, it does not necessarily mean that Lisa actually bought the red shirt or that Mark bought the blue shirt when this condition is not met.\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of both statements.\n\nStatement 1 tells us that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. Statement 2 tells us that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. Since we know that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, it is impossible for the condition in Statement 2 to be met (Lisa buying the red shirt). Therefore, the consequence of the conditional statement (Mark buying the blue shirt) cannot occur.\n\nStep 4: Determine if 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt' can be inferred from the given statements.\n\nSince we know that Mark did not buy the blue shirt and Statement 2 states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt, it follows that Lisa did not buy the red shirt because her buying the red shirt would have led to Mark buying the blue shirt, which we know did not happen.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
