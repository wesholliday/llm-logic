However, Statement 2 does not necessarily mean that the bear is always present in the cave when the wolf is there; it only implies that if the bear is present, then the wolf must also be present.\n\nStep 4: Determine if we can infer 'The bear was not in the cave'.\n\nGiven the information provided, we cannot definitively conclude that 'The bear was not in the cave'. The statements do not provide enough evidence to make this assumption.\n\nAnswer: no.",
