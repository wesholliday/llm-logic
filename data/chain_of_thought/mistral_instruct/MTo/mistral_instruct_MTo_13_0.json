It states that if the car is red, then the truck is blue. This does not directly relate to the first statement about the truck not being blue.\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of each statement.\n\nThe first statement tells us that the truck is not blue. The second statement tells us that if the car is red, then the truck is blue. However, it doesn't tell us anything about the color of the car or whether it is even mentioned in the context of the truck's color.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the possibility of 'The car was not red'.\n\nSince we don't have any information about the car's color and the second statement doesn't necessarily imply that the car is red, we cannot infer 'The car was not red' based on the given statements alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
