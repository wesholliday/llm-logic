It means that if the condition (shirt being cotton) is true, then the consequence (pants being denim) must also be true. However, we know that the first statement (pants not being denim) is already given as a fact.\n\nStep 3: Determine the implications of the given statements.\n\nSince the pants were not denim and the condition for denim pants in the second statement is the shirt being cotton, it follows that the shirt cannot be cotton based on the information provided.\n\nStep 4: Write your answer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
