This means that the mummy was in a state of being dead or dormant and not conscious.\n\nStep 6: The second statement is a conditional statement, which says \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This means that if the vampire is awake, it follows logically that the mummy must also be awake.\n\nStep 7: However, we know from the first statement that the mummy was not awake. Therefore, the second condition of the conditional statement cannot be true (the vampire being awake).\n\nStep 8: Since one part of the conditional statement is false, the entire conditional statement is invalid.\n\nStep 9: Given this information, we cannot infer that \"The vampire was not awake\" directly from the two statements provided. However, we can infer that the vampire was not awake based on the fact that the mummy was not awake and the conditional statement being invalid.\n\nAnswer: no (however, we can infer that the vampire was not awake based on the given information).",
