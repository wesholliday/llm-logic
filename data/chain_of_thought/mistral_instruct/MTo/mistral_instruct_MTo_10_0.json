This means that the presence of the cat outside prevents the dog from being inside.\n\nStep 3: Consider the given information and apply logical reasoning.\n\nGiven that the cat was not outside, it follows that the dog could potentially be inside based on the second statement. However, since the first statement states that the cat was not outside, it also implies that the dog must have been inside in order for the cat to not be outside (as per the second statement).\n\nStep 4: Formulate the final answer.\n\nAnswer: yes. The given information allows us to infer that the dog was inside.",
