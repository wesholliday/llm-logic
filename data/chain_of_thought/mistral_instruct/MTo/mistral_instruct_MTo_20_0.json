The banana was not yellow.\n2. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nNow let's consider what we can infer from these statements:\n\n1. We cannot directly infer that \"The apple was not red\" based on the given information because the first statement only tells us that the banana was not yellow, and the second statement establishes a conditional relationship between the colors of the apple and banana.\n2. However, if we had an additional piece of information stating that \"The banana is always yellow when the apple is red,\" then we could infer that \"The apple was not red\" based on the fact that the banana was not yellow. But without this extra piece of information, we cannot make that conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: no.",
