If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot directly infer 'The book was not written by James'. This is because the second statement only tells us that if James wrote the book, it would be a mystery novel. It does not necessarily mean that James did write the book and that it is indeed a mystery novel. Therefore, there could still be other possible explanations for why the book is not a mystery novel, such as another author writing it or the genre being different.\n\nAnswer: no.",
