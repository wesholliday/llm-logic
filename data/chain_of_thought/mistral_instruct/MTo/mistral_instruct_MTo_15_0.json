The second statement sets up a conditional relationship between Sam's mode of transportation (plane) and Erin's mode of transportation (train). It states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin would have taken a train.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possible implications.\n\nIf we assume that both statements are true, we can infer that Erin did not take a train, but according to the second statement, if Sam had taken a plane, then Erin would have taken a train instead. This creates a contradiction because it implies that Erin both didn't take a train and did take a train at the same time.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion based on the given information.\n\nSince we cannot accept a contradiction, one of the statements must be false. The first statement is known to be true (Erin did not take a train), so the second statement must be false. This means that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes (Sam did not take a plane).",
