Kate did not eat the salad.\n2. If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\n\nThe second statement creates a conditional relationship between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating the salad. However, we know that Kate didn't eat the salad based on the first statement.\n\nTo infer that \"Ben did not eat pasta,\" we would need to have enough information to establish that both conditions of the conditional statement are false (i.e., Ben didn't eat pasta, and Kate still didn't eat the salad). In this case, since we only know that Kate didn't eat the salad, we cannot make such an inference based on the given information alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
