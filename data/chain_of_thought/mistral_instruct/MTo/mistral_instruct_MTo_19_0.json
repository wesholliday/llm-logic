If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n\nFirst, we need to understand that the second statement is a conditional statement, which means it sets up a relationship between two statements. In this case, the first part 'If Tom watched football' is the hypothesis or assumption, and the second part 'then Jen watched basketball' is the consequence.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given information:\n1. We know that Jen did not watch basketball.\n2. The conditional statement tells us that if Tom watched football, then Jen would have watched basketball.\n\nHowever, we don't have any information about whether Tom actually watched football or not. Based on the given information alone, we cannot make a definitive conclusion about Tom's actions. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Tom did not watch football'.\n\nAnswer: no.",
