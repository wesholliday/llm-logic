The wolf was not in the den.\n\nStep 2: Analyze each statement independently.\n\nStatement 1 implies that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf must be in the den. This forms a conditional statement with an 'if' clause (bear in cave) and a consequent (wolf in den).\n\nStatement 2 asserts that the wolf was not in the den.\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of both statements together.\n\nIf Statement 1 is true, then Statement 2 cannot be true because Statement 1 states that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf must be in the den. However, Statement 2 says that the wolf was not in the den. This creates a contradiction.\n\nStep 4: Determine if it's possible for both statements to be true at the same time.\n\nSince there is a contradiction between the two statements, it's not possible for both of them to be true at the same time.\n\nStep 5: Infer the negation of one statement based on the other.\n\nGiven that Statement 1 and Statement 2 cannot both be true, we can infer that the negation of one statement must be true. Since Statement 1 is a conditional statement with an 'if' clause and a consequent, its negation would be either 'The bear was not in the cave' or 'The wolf was in the den'. However, Statement 2 states that the wolf was not in the den, so the only possible negation of one statement that can make both statements consistent is 'The bear was not in the cave'.\n\nStep 6: Write the final answer.\n\nAnswer: yes (The bear was not in the cave)",
