However, Statement 2 tells us that the cat was not outside. This creates a contradiction because we cannot have both the dog inside and the cat outside at the same time according to Statement 1.\n\nStep 3: Apply logical reasoning\n\nSince we have a contradiction, it means that at least one of the given statements is false. In this case, if Statement 1 were true, then Statement 2 would be false (since they contradict each other). But since Statement 2 is given as a fact, it must be that Statement 1 is false.\n\nStep 4: Determine the answer\n\nTherefore, 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside' is false, which means that when the dog is inside, it does not necessarily follow that the cat is outside. In other words, the presence or absence of the dog does not determine the presence or absence of the cat. Thus, we cannot infer 'The dog was inside' based on the given statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
