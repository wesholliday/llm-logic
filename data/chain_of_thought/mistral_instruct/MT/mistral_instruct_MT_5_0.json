We have two conditional statements: If p (Jeff plays basketball), then q (Amy plays tennis).\n2. Not-q (Amy does not play tennis) is given.\n3. To find out if we can infer not-p (Jeff does not play basketball), we need to apply the rules of conditional logic.\n4. The first rule is Modus Ponens, which states that if p implies q and p is true, then q must be true.\n5. The second rule is Modus Tollens, which states that if p implies q and not-q is true, then not-p must be true.\n6. In our case, we have p implied q (If Jeff plays basketball, then Amy plays tennis), and we also have not-q (Amy does not play tennis).\n7. To apply Modus Tollens, we need to negate the hypothesis of the given conditional statement: If not-p (Jeff does not play basketball), then not-q (Amy does not play tennis) must be true.\n8. Since we have not-q (Amy does not play tennis), and if not-p implies not-q, then our conclusion is that not-p (Jeff does not play basketball) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
