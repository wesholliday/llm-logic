(Let A represent Lisa buying the red shirt and B represent Mark buying the blue shirt.) So, A \u2192 B.\n2. Mark did not buy the blue shirt. (Not-B)\n\nStep 2: Apply the rules of logic.\n\nRule 1: Modus Ponens (MP): If A \u2192 B and A are true, then B is true.\nRule 2: Modus Tollens (MT): If A \u2192 B and Not-B are true, then A is false.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the given statements in terms of these rules.\n\nSince we have A \u2192 B and Not-B, we can apply Modus Tollens (MT) to infer that A is false.\n\nStep 4: State the final answer.\n\nAnswer: yes (Lisa did not buy the red shirt).",
