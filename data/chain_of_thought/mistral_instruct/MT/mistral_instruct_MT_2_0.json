If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest (this is the first statement).\n2. The unicorn was not in the forest (this is the second statement).\n\nNow, let's consider these statements together:\n\nIf statement 1 is true and statement 2 is false, then we have a contradiction. In this case, statement 1 cannot be true because if the griffin were in the forest, then the unicorn would also have to be there according to statement 1. But we know that the unicorn was not in the forest based on statement 2.\n\nTherefore, the only way for both statements to be consistent is if statement 1 is false, meaning that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest. This implies that the griffin cannot be in the forest when the unicorn is not.\n\nAnswer: yes (The griffin was not in the forest)",
