The pants were not denim.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the implications of each statement.\n\nStatement 1 implies that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim. This creates a conditional relationship between the two statements.\n\nStatement 2 states that the pants are not denim.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possible outcomes based on the given information.\n\nIf the shirt is cotton and the pants are not denim as stated, then the statement \"The pants were not denim\" contradicts the conditional relationship established in Statement 1. This means that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants cannot be anything other than denim according to Statement 1. Since Statement 2 states that the pants are not denim, it follows that the shirt cannot be cotton based on the given information.\n\nStep 4: Provide the final answer.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
