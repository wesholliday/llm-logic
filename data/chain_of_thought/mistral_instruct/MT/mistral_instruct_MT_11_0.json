However, Statement 2 tells us that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of the given statements\n\nSince we know that the muffins were not blueberry, and the conditional statement tells us that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry, it follows that the cake cannot be chocolate. Therefore, the cake must be something other than chocolate.\n\nStep 4: Write your answer\n\nAnswer: yes. The given statements do allow us to infer that the cake was not chocolate.",
