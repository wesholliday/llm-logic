However, the second statement states that Bob did not choose pasta. This creates a contradiction because according to the first statement, when Sue chooses pizza, Bob should have chosen pasta. Since we cannot have a contradiction in logic, it means that the initial assumption (Sue chose pizza) must be false.\n\nStep 3: Conclusion\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer 'Sue did not choose pizza'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
