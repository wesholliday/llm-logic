We have two conditional statements: If p (Tom watches football), then q (Jen watches basketball).\n2. Not-q (Jen did not watch basketball) is given.\n3. To find out if we can infer not-p (Tom did not watch football), we need to consider the possible scenarios that could make both statements true:\n   a. Tom watched football, but Jen didn't watch basketball (this scenario is inconsistent with the given information).\n   b. Tom didn't watch football, and Jen didn't watch basketball (this scenario is consistent with the given information).\n4. Since scenario a is inconsistent with the given information, we can conclude that Tom did not watch football in scenario b.\n5. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
