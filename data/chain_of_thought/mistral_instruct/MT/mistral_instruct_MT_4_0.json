In this case, p represents \"the alien visited Mars\" and q represents \"the robot visited Jupiter.\"\n\nStatement 2 says that q (robot visiting Jupiter) is false. Since the given if-then statement asserts that p implies q, it follows that if p is true and q is false, then we have a contradiction. In other words, if the alien visited Mars but the robot did not visit Jupiter, both statements cannot be true at the same time.\n\nStep 3: Determine the conclusion based on the given information\n\nSince having an alien visiting Mars and a robot not visiting Jupiter results in a contradiction, it is logical to infer that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
