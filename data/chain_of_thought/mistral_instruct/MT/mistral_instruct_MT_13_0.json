            "content": " Step 1: Understand the given statements.\n\nGiven statements are:\n1. If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n2. The truck was not blue.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the implications of each statement.\n\nStatement 1 implies that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. This creates a conditional relationship between the two statements.\n\nStatement 2 states that the truck is not blue. This means that the truck cannot be blue based on the given information.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possible scenarios based on the given statements.\n\nScenario 1: The car is red and the truck is blue (contradicts Statement 2).\n\nScenario 2: The car is not red (in this case, we don't have enough information to determine the color of the truck).\n\nStep 4: Determine if 'The car was not red' can be inferred from the given statements.\n\nSince Statement 2 contradicts Statement 1 when both statements are true (red car and blue truck), it is possible that the car being not red could be a valid scenario based on the given information. However, we cannot definitively conclude that 'The car was not red' can be inferred from the given statements alone because we don't have enough information to determine the color of the car for sure.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: no.",
