The banana was not yellow.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the implications of each statement.\n\nStatement 1 implies that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow. This is a conditional statement.\n\nStatement 2 states that the banana is not yellow.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possible scenarios based on the given statements.\n\nScenario 1: The apple is red and the banana is yellow (This scenario contradicts Statement 2).\n\nScenario 2: The apple is not red or the banana is yellow (This scenario satisfies both Statements 1 and 2).\n\nScenario 3: The apple is red and the banana is not yellow (This scenario violates Statement 1).\n\nStep 4: Determine if it's possible for the apple to be not red based on the given statements.\n\nSince Scenario 2 satisfies both Statements 1 and 2, it is possible for the apple to be not red.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
