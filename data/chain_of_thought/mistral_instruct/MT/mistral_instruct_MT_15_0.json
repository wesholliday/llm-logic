However, statement 2 states that Erin did not take a train. This creates a contradiction because we cannot have both \"if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" and \"Erin did not take a train\" true at the same time.\n\nStep 3: Determine if it is possible to infer 'Sam did not take a plane'.\n\nSince there is a contradiction between the given statements, it is possible to infer that one of them must be false. In this case, since we cannot have both Sam taking a plane and Erin taking a train at the same time given statement 2, it follows that 'Sam did not take a plane' is a valid conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
