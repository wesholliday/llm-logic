This is a conditional statement with the \"if...then\" structure.\n\nStatement 2 states that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possible implications of both statements.\n\nIf Statement 1 is true, then Statement 2 cannot be true because Statement 1 implies that if Joe goes to the park, Lucy goes to the zoo. Therefore, if Lucy did not go to the zoo (Statement 2), it must mean that Joe did not go to the park (since Statement 1 states that they are connected events).\n\nStep 4: Combine the implications from Step 3 and form a final answer.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
