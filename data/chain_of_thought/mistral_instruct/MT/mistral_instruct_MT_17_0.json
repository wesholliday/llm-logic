We have two statements: 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad' and 'Kate did not eat the salad'.\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement, meaning it sets up a relationship between two events: If event A (Ben eating pasta) occurs, then event B (Kate eating the salad) also occurs.\n3. The second statement tells us that event B (Kate not eating the salad) occurred.\n4. However, we cannot directly infer that event A (Ben not eating pasta) occurred based on these two statements alone. This is because the conditional statement only tells us that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad; it does not guarantee that Ben actually did eat pasta.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Ben did not eat pasta' from these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no.",
