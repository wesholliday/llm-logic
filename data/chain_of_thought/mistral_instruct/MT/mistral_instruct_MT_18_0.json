However, the second statement states that the truck is not metal. This creates a contradiction because we cannot have both the doll being plastic and the truck being metal at the same time according to Statement 1.\n\nStep 3: Infer from the given statements\n\nSince there's a contradiction between the two statements, it means that at least one of them must be false. Let's assume Statement 1 is false for now. If Statement 1 is false, then the doll can be plastic and the truck can still be something other than metal (it could be wood, for example). Therefore, if Statement 1 is false, it does not necessarily mean that the doll is not plastic; it just means that the statement itself is incorrect.\n\nHowever, we know that Statement 2 is true because the truck was explicitly stated as not being metal.\n\nSince Statement 1 is potentially false and Statement 2 is true, we cannot definitively infer 'The doll was not plastic' based on the given statements alone.\n\nStep 4: Provide the answer\n\nAnswer: no.",
