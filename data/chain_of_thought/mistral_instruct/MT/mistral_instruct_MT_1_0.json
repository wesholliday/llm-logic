It tells us that if Mary is at the wedding, then Sue must also be there.\n\nStatement 2: This statement tells us that Sue was not present at the wedding.\n\nStep 3: Now let's consider both statements together and try to infer whether Mary was at the wedding or not.\n\nSince we know that Sue was not at the wedding (Statement 2), it means that if Mary was there (Statement 1), then Sue would have been as well. But since Sue wasn't there, it follows that Mary couldn't have been either because having Mary present would have implied Sue being present, and we know that's not the case.\n\nStep 4: Based on our reasoning above, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
