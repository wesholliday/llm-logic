The mummy was not awake (let's call this statement B).\n\nNow, we need to determine if statement A is true or false based on statements A and B.\n\n1. If statement A were true, then statement B would have to be false because the premise of statement A states that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake. However, statement B asserts that the mummy was not awake. These two statements contradict each other.\n2. Therefore, statement A must be false since it leads to a logical contradiction with statement B.\n3. Since statement A is false, it means that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is not necessarily awake.\n4. Thus, we cannot infer 'The vampire was not awake' based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no.",
