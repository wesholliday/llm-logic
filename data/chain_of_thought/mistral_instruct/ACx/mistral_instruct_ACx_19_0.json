In this case, \"vreebling\" causes \"plagging.\"\n2. \"The smonk plagged\": This statement indicates that the smonk did indeed experience plagging.\n3. To infer that \"The smonk was vreebled,\" we need to determine if it's possible for the condition (vreebling) to be true based on the available information. If so, then our inference would be valid.\n4. Since we know that plagging occurred (from statement 2), and according to statement 1, vreebling causes plagging, it follows logically that the smonk must have been vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
