In other words, \"slogging\" the glip necessarily leads to it being \"tragged.\"\n2. \"The glip was tragged\": This statement indicates that the glip has undergone some unfortunate event or condition, which is represented by the term \"tragged.\"\n\nTo infer \"The glip was slogged,\" we would need to know that the condition (slogging) in the first statement has been met. However, the second statement only tells us about the consequence (tragging), not the condition. Therefore, we cannot directly infer \"The glip was slogged\" from these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
