It means that if the condition (grommet being sploffed) is true, then the consequence (grommet plopping the frink) must also be true.\n2. \"The grommet plopped the frink\": This is a simple declarative statement indicating that the grommet did indeed drop or plop something called a frink.\n\nTo infer \"The grommet was sploffed\" from these two statements, we need to determine if the condition (grommet being sploffed) has been established as true. The second statement only tells us that the consequence (grommet plopped the frink) occurred. It does not directly confirm that the grommet was sploffed before it plopped the frink.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer \"The grommet was sploffed\" with certainty.\nAnswer: no.",
