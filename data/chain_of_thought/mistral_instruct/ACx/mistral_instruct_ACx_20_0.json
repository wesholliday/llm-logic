However, this statement does not necessarily mean that the fleeg was actually buttered; it only implies that if it were, then it would become a surn.\n2. \"The fleeg surned\": This statement means that the fleeg became a surn. But we don't know what caused it to become a surn.\n\nGiven this information, we cannot infer that \"The fleeg was bluttered\" based on the two statements provided. The first statement implies that butting the fleeg could make it a surn, but it doesn't confirm that the fleeg was actually buttered. The second statement only tells us that the fleeg became a surn for some reason.\n\nAnswer: no.",
