We have two conditional statements: \"If p, then q\" (where p = 'the dreb was vroombed' and q = 'the dreb was spened') and \"q\" (the dreb was spened).\n2. To determine if we can infer p from these statements, we need to consider the relationship between p, q, and the conditional statement \"If p, then q.\"\n3. The conditional statement \"If p, then q\" means that whenever p is true, q must also be true. It does not necessarily mean that whenever q is true, p must also be true (this would be a biconditional statement).\n4. In this case, we have been given that q is true (\"The dreb was spened\"). However, the truth of q does not directly imply the truth of p (\"The dreb was vroombed\").\n5. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer \"The dreb was vroombed\" from \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\" and \"The dreb was spened.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
