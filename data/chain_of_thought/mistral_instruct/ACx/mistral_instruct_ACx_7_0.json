If p implies q (p -> q), then p is true only if q is true.\n\nGiven:\n1. If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked (shanked -> tinked)\n2. The whiffle tinked (tinked is true)\n\nTo infer 'The whiffle was shanked', we need to show that shanked is a logical consequence of the given statements. We can do this by showing that if we assume the negation of shanked, then we can derive a contradiction:\n\nAssume ~shanked (i.e., the whiffle was not shanked)\n\nFrom 1 and 2, we have:\n1. If the whiffle was not shanked, then the whiffle did not tink (~shanked -> ~tinked) (by negating both sides of the original implication)\n2. The whiffle tinked (tinked is true)\n\nSince we have both ~shanked and tinked, we have a contradiction. Therefore, our assumption that ~shanked must be false, and shanked must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
