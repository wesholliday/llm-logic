Amy might not have played tennis (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Jeff did not play basketball (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument is not valid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The fact that Amy might not have played tennis does not imply that Jeff did not play basketball. These two statements are independent of each other. Therefore, the argument as a whole is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no.",
