The banana might not have been yellow (Second premise)\n\nFrom these two premises, we cannot infer that 'The apple was not red'. This is because the second premise only introduces a possibility that the banana was not yellow, but it does not necessarily mean that it actually wasn't. The argument could be refuted by the scenario where the apple is red and the banana is yellow or even some other color. Therefore, the conclusion 'The apple was not red' cannot be logically deduced from the given premises alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
