            "content": " To determine the logical validity of the given argument, we need to apply the rules of logic to its premises and conclusion. Let's break down each part of the argument:\n\n1. If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal (Premise 1)\n2. The truck might not have been metal (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the doll was not plastic (Conclusion)\n\nThe given argument is an example of a form of reasoning called \"modus tollens.\" In this logical pattern, we start with a conditional statement (if p then q), and we are told that not-q is true. The goal is to determine whether p must be false.\n\nTo apply modus tollens to the given argument:\n\n1. If P (doll is plastic) then Q (truck is metal)\n2. Not-Q (truck is not metal)\n3. Therefore, not-P (doll is not plastic)\n\nSince the logical form of the argument matches the pattern of modus tollens and all premises and conclusions are stated in negations, we need to find the corresponding affirmative statements:\n\n1. If doll is plastic, then truck is metal\n2. Truck is not metal\n3. Therefore, doll is not plastic\n\nNow let's check if this argument is logically valid by applying the rules of logic:\n\n1. Premise 1 is a conditional statement (if p then q)\n2. Premise 2 states that not-q is true (truck is not metal)\n3. The conclusion, not-P (doll is not plastic), follows from premises 1 and 2 using modus tollens rule\n\nAnswer: yes",
