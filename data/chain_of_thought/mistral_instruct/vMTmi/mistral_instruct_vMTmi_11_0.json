The muffins might not have been blueberry (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the cake was not chocolate (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument is not valid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The second premise introduces a possibility that contradicts the first premise, but it does not eliminate the possibility that both the cake and muffins could be of their respective stated flavors. Therefore, the absence of blueberry muffins does not logically imply that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no.",
