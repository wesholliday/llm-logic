Bob might not have chosen pasta (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Sue did not choose pizza (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument is invalid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The second premise only states that it's possible for Bob to have chosen something other than pasta, but it doesn't actually say that he did. Therefore, even if Sue's choice of pizza implies that Bob chose pasta (as per Premise 1), it doesn't logically follow that Sue didn't choose pizza just because Bob might not have chosen pasta.\n\nAnswer: no.",
