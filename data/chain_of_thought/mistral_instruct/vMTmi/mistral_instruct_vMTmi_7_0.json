If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race (Premise 1)\n2. Chris might not have finished the race (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Alex did not finish the race (Conclusion)\n\nFirst, let's examine Premises 1 and 2:\n\n1. If A, then B (Conditional statement)\n2. Not B (Negation of B)\n\nNow, we need to determine if it is possible for both premises to be true at the same time. To do this, let's consider a hypothetical scenario where:\n\n1. Alex finishes the race (A), but\n2. Chris does not finish the race (Not B)\n\nIf both Premises 1 and 2 are true in this scenario, then the argument is invalid because its conclusion, \"Alex did not finish the race,\" would be false.\n\nAnswer: no.",
