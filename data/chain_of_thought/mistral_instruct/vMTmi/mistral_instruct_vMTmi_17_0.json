Therefore, Ben did not eat pasta (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument is invalid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The premises only establish a conditional relationship between Ben's eating pasta and Kate's eating salad. They do not provide any information about whether or not Ben actually ate pasta, so it is possible that both premises are true and the conclusion is false.\n\nAnswer: no.",
