            "content": " To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to apply the rules of logic to its premises and conclusion. Let's analyze each part step by step:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding (Premise 1)\n2. Sue might not have been at the wedding (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Mary was not at the wedding (Conclusion)\n\nFirst, let's examine Premises 1 and 2:\n\n1. If A, then B (Conditional statement)\n2. Not-B (Negation of B)\n\nNow, we need to determine if it is possible for both Premises 1 and 2 to be true at the same time. This situation is known as a contradiction. To check for a contradiction, we can use a truth table:\n\n| A | B |\n|---|---|\n| T | T |\n| T | F |\n| F | T |\n| F | F |\n\nSince there exists an entry where A is true and B is false (the third row), it means that both Premises 1 and 2 can be true at the same time. However, this result leads to an inconsistency because the argument's conclusion states that A (Mary) was not at the wedding, which contradicts the first premise.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no.",
