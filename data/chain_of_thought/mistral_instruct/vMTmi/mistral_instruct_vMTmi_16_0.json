The pants might not have been denim (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the shirt was not cotton (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises. The second premise introduces a possibility that contradicts the first premise, but it doesn't mean that the first premise is false. The argument would be valid if we had \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" as the first premise instead, and then said \"But the pants weren't denim,\" which would logically imply \"The shirt wasn't cotton.\" However, with the given premises, there could still be cases where the shirt is cotton and the pants are not denim. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no.",
