Erin might not have taken a train (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Sam did not take a plane (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument is invalid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The fact that Erin might not have taken a train does not necessarily mean that Sam took a plane. There could be other possible explanations for why Erin didn't take a train without implying that Sam did not take a plane. Therefore, the argument is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no.",
