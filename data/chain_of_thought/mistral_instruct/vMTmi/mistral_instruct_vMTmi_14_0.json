If p (bear in cave), then q (wolf in den)\n2. Not-q (wolf not in den) is possible\n3. Therefore, not-p (bear not in cave)\n\nFirst, let's check if the premises contradict each other:\n\n1. If p, then q\n2. Not-q is possible\n\nSince 'If p, then q' implies that when p is true, q must be true as well. However, we are told that not-q (wolf not in den) is possible. This means that even though p (bear in cave) might be true, it does not necessarily imply that q (wolf in den) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because its conclusion 'not-p' (bear not in cave) does not follow from its premises.\n\nAnswer: no.",
