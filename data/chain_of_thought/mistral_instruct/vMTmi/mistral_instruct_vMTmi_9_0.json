Mark might not have bought the blue shirt (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Lisa did not buy the red shirt (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument is invalid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The second premise introduces a possibility that contradicts the first premise, but it does not necessarily mean that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. The argument would only be valid if we had an additional premise stating that if Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa could not have bought the red shirt. Without this premise, there is a logical gap between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no.",
