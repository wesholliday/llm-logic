If p (griffin in forest), then q (unicorn in forest) - First premise\n2. Not-q (unicorn not in forest) - Second premise\n3. Therefore, not-p (griffin not in forest) - Conclusion\n\nNow let's check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises:\n\n1. Given: p \u2192 q\n2. Given: \u00acq\n\nTo find the logical consequence of these premises, we can use a truth table or apply the rules of logic directly. In this case, we will apply the rule of Modus Tollens (MT), which states that if \"p \u2192 q\" and \"\u00acq\", then \"\u00acp\".\n\nApplying Modus Tollens to our premises:\n1. p \u2192 q\n2. \u00acq\n\nTherefore, \u00acp (Griffin not in the forest)\n\nAnswer: yes",
