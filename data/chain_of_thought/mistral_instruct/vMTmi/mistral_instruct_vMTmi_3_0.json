Therefore, the book was not written by James (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument is not valid because there could be other possible explanations for why the book isn't a mystery novel besides James not being its author. For example, it could have been written by someone else who doesn't write mystery novels. The premises do not logically entail the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no.",
