The truck might not have been blue (Second premise)\n3. Therefore, the car was not red (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises. The second premise only states that the truck's being blue is a possibility, but it doesn't prove that the truck wasn't blue. Thus, even if the truck was blue, the argument would still be invalid because the first premise could be false. Therefore, just having the possibility of the truck not being blue does not logically imply that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: no.",
