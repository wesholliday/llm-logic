Jen might not have watched basketball (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Tom did not watch football (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument is not valid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The premises only establish a conditional relationship between Tom's watching football and Jen's watching basketball. They do not provide any information about whether Tom actually watched football or not. Therefore, even if it turns out that Jen did not watch basketball, it does not necessarily mean that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: no.",
