Lucy might not have gone to the zoo (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Joe did not go to the park (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument is invalid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The premises only establish a conditional relationship between Joe's going to the park and Lucy's going to the zoo. They do not provide sufficient information to conclude that Joe did not go to the park based on the possibility that Lucy did not go to the zoo.",
