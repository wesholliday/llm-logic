The mummy might not have been awake (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the vampire was not awake (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument is not valid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. Premise 1 states a conditional relationship between the two statements, but Premise 2 introduces a possible exception to that relationship. The conclusion goes beyond what can be logically inferred from the given premises. Answer: no.",
