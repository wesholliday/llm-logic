            "content": " Step 1: Understand the given conditional statement.\n\nThe given conditional statement is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim.\" This means that if the condition (shirt being cotton) is true, then the consequence (pants not being denim) must also be true.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the inverse of the given conditional statement.\n\nTo find the inverse of the given conditional statement, we need to swap the hypothesis and the conclusion. The inverse of \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim\" is \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine if the inverse is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nLogical equivalence means that two statements have the same meaning and implication. In this case, we need to determine if \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton\" implies \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim,\" and vice versa.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the implications.\n\nLet's assume that the statement \"The shirt is cotton\" is true. According to the original conditional statement, if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are not denim. Therefore, if the shirt is cotton, the pants cannot be denim.\n\nNow let's evaluate the inverse statement. If the statement \"The pants are denim\" is true, according to the inverse statement, the shirt must not be cotton. However, we already know that if the pants are denim and the shirt is cotton, then the original conditional statement would be false. Therefore, the inverse statement cannot be true when the pants are denim and the shirt is cotton.\n\nStep 5: Conclusion.\n\nSince the inverse statement does not hold true for all possible combinations of shirt and pant materials, it is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton\" from \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
