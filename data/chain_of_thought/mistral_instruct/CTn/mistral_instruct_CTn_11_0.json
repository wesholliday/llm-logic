This is an example of a conditional statement with the form 'if p, then q'.\n\nThe negation of this statement would be 'If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins could have been blueberry' (or any other flavor). However, the original statement does not allow for the possibility that the muffins could have been blueberry if the cake was not chocolate. Therefore, we cannot directly infer 'If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate'.\n\nAnswer: no.",
