The reversed conditional statement is \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic.\" This means that if the truck is metal, then the doll cannot be plastic.\n\nStep 3: Check for validity of the new conditional statement.\n\nThe given conditional statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was not metal\" holds true only when both conditions are met. That is, if the doll is plastic, then the truck must not be metal.\n\nNow, let's check the reversed conditional statement \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic.\" This statement also holds true only when both conditions are met. That is, if the truck is metal, then the doll must not be plastic.\n\nSince both the given and reversed conditional statements hold true under the same conditions, we can infer that \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic\" is a valid inference from the original statement.\n\nStep 4: Write the answer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
