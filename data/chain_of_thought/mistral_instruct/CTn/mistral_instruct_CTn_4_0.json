If the alien visited Mars (p), then the robot did not visit Jupiter (q).\n\nStep 3: Determine the relationship between p and q\n\nThe given statement indicates that p and q are mutually exclusive events, meaning they cannot occur at the same time.\n\nStep 4: Understand the inverse of the conditional statement\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the robot visited Jupiter (r), then the alien did not visit Mars (s)\" from the given statement, we need to find the inverse of the original conditional statement. The inverse is:\n\n1. If the robot visited Jupiter (r), then the alien did not visit Mars (s) if and only if it is not the case that if the alien visited Mars (p), then the robot did not visit Jupiter (q).\n\nStep 5: Check for the contrapositive of the original statement\n\nThe contrapositive of \"If p, then q\" is \"If not q, then not p.\" In our case, this would be:\n\n1. If the alien did not visit Mars (not p), then the robot visited Jupiter (not q).\n\nStep 6: Determine if the inverse and contrapositive are equivalent\n\nFor the inverse and contrapositive to be equivalent, they must have the same truth table. In this case, since p and q are mutually exclusive events, their negations (not p and not q) will also be mutually exclusive. Therefore, the inverse and contrapositive are equivalent in this situation.\n\nStep 7: Conclusion\n\nSince the inverse and contrapositive are equivalent, we can infer \"If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
