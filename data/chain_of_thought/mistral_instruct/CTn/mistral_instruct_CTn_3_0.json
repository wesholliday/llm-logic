This means that if the premise (P) is true, then the conclusion (Q) must be true. In this case, the premise is 'the book was written by James' and the conclusion is 'the book is not a mystery novel'.\n\nThe second statement, 'If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James', has the form 'If Q, then P'. This means that if the conclusion (Q) is true, then the premise (P) must be false. In this case, the premise is 'the book was written by James' and the conclusion is 'the book is a mystery novel'.\n\nTo determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to consider if they have the same logical relationship between their premises and conclusions. However, as we can see, they have opposite logical relationships - one states that if the premise is true, then the conclusion is false; while the other states that if the conclusion is true, then the premise must be false.\n\nTherefore, it's not possible to infer 'If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James' from 'If the book was written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel'.\n\nAnswer: no.",
