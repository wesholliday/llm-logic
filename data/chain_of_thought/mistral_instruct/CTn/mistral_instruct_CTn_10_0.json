In this case, the hypothesis is 'the dog was inside' and the conclusion is 'the cat was not outside'. To negate these statements, we get 'the dog was not inside' and 'the cat was outside', respectively.\n\nNow, let's check if the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement:\n\n1. If the dog was not inside, then the cat was outside (contrapositive).\n2. If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside (original statement negated and hypothesis and conclusion switched).\n\nSince both statements are identical, we can conclude that the given statement implies its contrapositive, and therefore, we can infer 'If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside'.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
