'If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow': This is a conditional statement that states if the apple is red, then the banana cannot be yellow at the same time. It does not make any statements about what color the apple or banana are when they are not red or yellow respectively.\n2. 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red': This is a contradictory statement to the original conditional statement. It states that if the banana is yellow, then the apple cannot be red. However, it does not necessarily mean that the apple must be another color when the banana is yellow.\n3. To infer 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red' from 'If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow', we would need to have enough information to establish a biconditional relationship between the two statements (i.e., both statements are true if and only if certain conditions are met). In this case, we do not have that information.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red' from 'If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow'.\n\nAnswer: no.",
