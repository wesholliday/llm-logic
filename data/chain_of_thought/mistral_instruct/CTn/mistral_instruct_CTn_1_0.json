            "content": " To determine if we can infer 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding' from 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding', we need to consider the meaning of each conditional statement.\n\nThe first statement, 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding', is an example of a contrapositive statement. A contrapositive is formed by swapping the hypotheses and negations in the original conditional statement. In this case, the original statement is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding'. The contrapositive would be 'If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding'.\n\nHowever, just because one conditional statement has a true contrapositive does not necessarily mean that the converse (swapping the roles of the hypotheses) is also true. In this case, the converse of the original statement would be 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding'.\n\nTo determine if this converse is true, we need to consider the possible scenarios that could make both statements true. If 'Mary was at the wedding' implies 'Sue was not at the wedding', and 'Sue was not at the wedding' implies 'Mary was not at the wedding', then both statements are logically equivalent. However, if there is a scenario where 'Mary was at the wedding' but Sue was also present, then the converse statement would be false.\n\nWithout more information about the specific context of the wedding and the relationships between Mary and Sue, it is impossible to definitively say whether or not 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding' is true. Therefore, we cannot infer this statement from the original statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
