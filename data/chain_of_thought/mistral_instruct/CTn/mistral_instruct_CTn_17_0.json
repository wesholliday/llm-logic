'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate did not eat the salad': This statement is saying that whenever Ben eats pasta, Kate does not eat the salad. In other words, these two events are mutually exclusive.\n2. 'If Kate ate the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta': This statement is saying that whenever Kate eats the salad, Ben does not eat pasta. However, this is not necessarily true based on the given information. For example, it's possible for both Ben and Kate to have eaten different meals entirely.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If Kate ate the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta' from 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate did not eat the salad'.\n\nAnswer: no.",
