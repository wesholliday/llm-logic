            "content": " To determine if we can infer 'If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt' from 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt', we need to consider the meaning of each conditional statement.\n\nThe first statement, 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt', is a biconditional statement in disguise. It can be rephrased as 'Lisa bought the red shirt if and only if Mark did not buy the blue shirt'. This means that both statements must be true for this conditional to hold.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement, 'If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt'. This is a contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of 'If p, then q' is 'If not q, then not p'. In this case, we have 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt', so its contrapositive would be 'If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\n\nSince both the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent (meaning they convey the same information), we can infer that 'If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt' is a valid conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
