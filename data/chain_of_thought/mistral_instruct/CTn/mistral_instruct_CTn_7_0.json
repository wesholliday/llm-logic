'If Alex finished the race, then Chris did not finish the race': This statement implies that if Alex crossed the finish line, Chris did not. In other words, their finishing positions are reversed.\n2. 'If Chris finished the race, then Alex did not finish the race': This statement implies that if Chris crossed the finish line, Alex did not. However, this is not the same as the first statement because it places Chris before Alex in terms of finishing the race.\n\nTo infer that 'If Chris finished the race, then Alex did not finish the race' from 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris did not finish the race', we would need to have the same relationship between their finishing positions (i.e., one person always finishes before the other). Since the statements as given do not guarantee this relationship, we cannot make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no.",
