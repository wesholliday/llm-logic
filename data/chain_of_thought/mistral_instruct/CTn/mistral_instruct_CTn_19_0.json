            "content": " To determine if the given conditional statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen did not watch basketball\" implies \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football,\" we need to consider the relationship between the two statements.\n\nFirst, let's examine the original statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\" This is an example of a biconditional statement with the 'if' part being a contrapositive. A contrapositive is formed by swapping the hypotheses and negating both sides of the original conditional statement. In this case, the contrapositive of \"If Tom watched football, then Jen did not watch basketball\" is \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nSince the original statement and its contrapositive have the same meaning, we can infer that \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football\" is a valid conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
