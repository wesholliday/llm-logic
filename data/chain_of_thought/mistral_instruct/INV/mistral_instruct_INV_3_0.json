Given statement: If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n2. Contrapositive: If the book is not a mystery novel, then it was not written by James.\n\nTo check for logical equivalence, we need to make sure that both statements have the same meaning. Let's test this by assuming the contrapositive and seeing if it leads us back to the original statement.\n\nAssumption: If the book is not a mystery novel, then it was not written by James.\n\nNow, let's assume the negation of the given statement:\n\nNegation of given statement: The book was not written by James.\n\nFrom our assumption, we know that if the book was not a mystery novel, then it was not written by James. Since we have assumed that the book was not written by James, it follows that the book is not a mystery novel (as per our assumption).\n\nTherefore, the given statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if we know that the book was not written by James, then we can infer that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: yes",
