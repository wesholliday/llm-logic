The given statement only states a relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana when the apple is red. It does not provide any information about what the color of the banana is when the apple is not red.\n\nStep 3: Explain your reasoning.\n\nThe given conditional statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" only establishes a relationship between the two statements when the first statement (P) is true. It does not provide any information about what happens when the first statement (P) is false. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the apple is not red, then the banana is not yellow based on this given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
