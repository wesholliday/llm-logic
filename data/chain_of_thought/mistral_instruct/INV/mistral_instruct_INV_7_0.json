Given: If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n2. Contrapositive: If Chris didn't finish the race, then Alex didn't finish the race.\n3. To find out if the original statement implies the contrapositive, we need to check if both statements are logically equivalent.\n4. Let's assume that \"Alex finished the race\" is true. Then, according to the given statement, \"Chris finished the race\" must also be true. Now let's assume that \"Chris didn't finish the race\" is false (i.e., Chris did finish the race). Since we already know that Alex finished the race when Chris did, the contrapositive holds true in this case.\n5. Let's now assume that \"Alex finished the race\" is false (i.e., Alex didn't finish the race). We need to show that if Chris didn't finish the race, then Alex also didn't finish the race for the contrapositive to hold true. Since we know that if Alex didn't finish the race, Chris not finishing the race is a valid conclusion from the given statement, the contrapositive holds true in this case as well.\n6. Therefore, since both the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can infer \"If Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race\" from \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
