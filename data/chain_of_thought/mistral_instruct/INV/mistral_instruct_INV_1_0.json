            "content": " To determine if we can infer 'If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding' from 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', we need to consider the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement, 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between Mary and Sue being present at the wedding. This means that whenever Mary is present, Sue is also present.\n\nHowever, the second statement, 'If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding', is the opposite of the first statement. It states that whenever Mary is not present, Sue is also not present.\n\nTo infer the second statement from the first, we would need to have logical certainty that the relationship between Mary and Sue's presence at the wedding is such that their absence from the wedding is always correlated. In other words, if Mary is never at a wedding without Sue being there, then it could be inferred that whenever Mary is not present, Sue is also not present.\n\nHowever, we cannot make this assumption based on the given information alone. The first statement only establishes a relationship of presence, but it does not necessarily establish a relationship of absence. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding' from 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding'.\n\nAnswer: no.",
