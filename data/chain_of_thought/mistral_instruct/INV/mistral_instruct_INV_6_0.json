The reason is that a conditional statement only establishes a relationship between P and Q, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the absence of P implies the absence of Q.\n\nStep 3: Explain your reasoning.\n\nThe given statement tells us that if Sue chooses pizza, then Bob chooses pasta. However, it does not provide any information about what happens when Sue does not choose pizza. For all we know, Bob could be choosing something other than pasta when Sue doesn't pick pizza. Therefore, based on the given information alone, we cannot infer that \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
