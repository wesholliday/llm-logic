The given statement makes a connection between two things (doll being plastic and truck being metal), but it does not necessarily mean that if one thing is not true, then the other must be false. For example, it's possible for the doll to be made of another material (not plastic) and for the truck to still be metal. Therefore, we cannot infer the negation from the given statement based on the information provided alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
