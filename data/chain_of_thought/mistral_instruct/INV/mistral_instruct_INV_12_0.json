This is the contrapositive of the given statement's contrapositive.\n\nTo check this, let's assume that 'Joe did not go to the park' and see if it implies 'Lucy did not go to the zoo'.\n\nIf Joe did not go to the park, then according to the contrapositive of the given statement, Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that 'Joe did not go to the park' is consistent with 'Lucy did not go to the zoo', and we have shown that the implication holds true.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
