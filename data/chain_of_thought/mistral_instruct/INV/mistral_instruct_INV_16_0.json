There are four possibilities:\n\n1. Shirt is cotton, pants are denim (original statement is true)\n2. Shirt is cotton, pants are not denim (inverse is false)\n3. Shirt is not cotton, pants are denim (given statement is false)\n4. Shirt is not cotton, pants are not denim (both statements are true)\n\nFrom the analysis above, we can see that when the shirt is cotton and pants are not denim, the inverse statement is false. Therefore, the inverse statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question.\n\nAnswer: No.",
