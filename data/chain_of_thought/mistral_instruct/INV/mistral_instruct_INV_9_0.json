            "content": " To determine if we can infer 'If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt' from 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt', let's consider the given information and its implications.\n\n1. The first statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement that describes a relationship between two events: Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. It suggests that these two events are linked such that if one event occurs, the other event follows.\n2. However, this statement does not necessarily mean that the absence of one event implies the absence of the other event. For example, it's possible for Lisa to have not bought the red shirt without Mark having not bought the blue shirt as well.\n3. To infer 'If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt', we would need to establish a stronger relationship between these two events, such that the absence of one event implies the absence of the other event. But based on the given information, there's no guarantee that this is the case.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt' from 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n\nAnswer: no.",
