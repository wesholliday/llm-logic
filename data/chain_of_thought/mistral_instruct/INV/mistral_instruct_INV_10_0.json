It does not necessarily mean that when the cat is not outside (i.e., it's inside), the dog must be inside as well.\n\nStep 3: Consider the inverse of the given statement\n\nThe inverse of \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" would be \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside.\" However, this is not the same as \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside.\"\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the inverse statement from the given information\n\nThe given statement does not provide enough information to infer that \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no.",
