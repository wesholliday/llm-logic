It does not directly state anything about what happens when p is not true.\n\nStep 3: Consider the inverse relationship.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train,\" we need to consider the inverse relationship between Sam's action and Erin's action.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the inverse relationship based on the given information.\n\nThe given statement only tells us that when Sam takes a plane, Erin takes a train. It does not provide any information about what happens when Sam does not take a plane. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train\" is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no.",
