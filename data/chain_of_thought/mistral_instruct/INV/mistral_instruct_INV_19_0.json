If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball (given)\n2. This implies that there is a causal or conditional relationship between Tom's football-watching and Jen's basketball-watching. However, we cannot determine the direction of this relationship from the given information alone. It could be that Tom's watching football causes Jen to watch basketball, or it could be that Jen's watching basketball causes Tom to watch football.\n3. To make the conclusion 'If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball', we would need to know that Jen's basketball-watching is dependent on Tom's football-watching and that she does not watch basketball when Tom does not watch football.\n4. Without this additional information, we cannot make the conclusion 'If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball'.\n\nAnswer: no.",
