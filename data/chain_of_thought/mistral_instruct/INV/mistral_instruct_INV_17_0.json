            "content": " Step 1: Understand the given conditional statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the meaning of this conditional statement. It states that if Ben eats pasta, then Kate eats salad. This is called a biconditional statement, but it's actually two separate conditional statements:\n\n1) If Ben eats pasta, then Kate eats salad. (This is the original statement.)\n2) If Kate eats salad, then Ben ate pasta. (The converse of the original statement, which is not given in the question.)\n\nStep 3: Consider the negation of each conditional statement:\n\n1) If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad. (This is the contrapositive of the original statement.)\n2) If Kate ate salad, then Ben did not eat pasta. (The contrapositive of the converse of the original statement.)\n\nStep 4: Determine if we can infer 'If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad' from the given information.\n\nSince the original conditional statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" is a biconditional statement, both the forward implication (Ben eats pasta \u2192 Kate eats salad) and the converse implication (Kate eats salad \u2192 Ben eats pasta) are true. However, we only have the forward implication given in the question.\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement is 'If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad'. To determine if this is true or false, we need to check if it follows from the given information.\n\nSince the original statement is a biconditional statement, its contrapositive is also true. Therefore, 'If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad' is a valid conclusion based on the given information.\n\nStep 5: Write your answer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
