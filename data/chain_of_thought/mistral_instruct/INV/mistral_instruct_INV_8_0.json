The reverse statement would be \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake\" implies that whenever the vampire is not awake, the mummy is also not awake under those same circumstances.\n\nStep 3: Consider possible scenarios.\n\nLet's consider some possible scenarios to help determine if this reverse conditional statement is true or false:\n\nScenario 1: Both the vampire and the mummy are always awake at the same time. In this case, the given conditional statement is true, and the reverse conditional statement is also true because they are always awake together.\n\nScenario 2: The vampire can be awake when the mummy is asleep, but the mummy cannot be awake when the vampire is asleep. In this case, the given conditional statement is not true (vampire awake does not imply mummy awake), and the reverse conditional statement is also not true (vampire asleep does not imply mummy asleep).\n\nScenario 3: Both the vampire and the mummy can be asleep or awake independently of each other. In this case, the given conditional statement is not true (vampire awake does not necessarily mean mummy awake), but the reverse conditional statement could potentially be true depending on whether they are always awake or asleep together or not.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion.\n\nBased on our analysis, we cannot definitively infer that \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake\" is always true based on the given conditional statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" The reverse conditional statement depends on the specific relationship between the vampire and the mummy's wake/sleep patterns.\n\nAnswer: no.",
