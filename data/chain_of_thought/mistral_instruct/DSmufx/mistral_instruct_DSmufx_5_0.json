However, the statement \"Either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled\" does not necessarily mean that if the zinger isn't required to be smoogled, then it must be fraggled. It only means that those are the two possibilities.\n\nTherefore, we cannot directly infer \"The zinger is fraggled\" from these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
