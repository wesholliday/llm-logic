The first statement is \"Either the twonk must be varnished or it is plinked.\" This statement suggests that there are only two possibilities for the twonk: either it must be varnished, or it must be plinked.\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the twonk must be plinked.\" This statement negates the second possibility from the first statement, meaning that the twonk cannot be plinked.\n3. Since we have eliminated the possibility of the twonk being plinked, the only remaining option is that it must be varnished.\n4. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can infer \"The twonk is varnished.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
