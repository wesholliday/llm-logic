If the flugel cannot be zargled (as stated in the second proposition), then it must be blimmed according to this statement.\n2. \"It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled\": This statement negates the first proposition, meaning that the flugel cannot be forced to be zargled.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that the flugel is blimmed because:\n\n1. If the flugel cannot be zargled (as stated in the second proposition), then it must be blimmed according to the first proposition (since \"Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed\" is an either-or statement).\n\nAnswer: yes.",
