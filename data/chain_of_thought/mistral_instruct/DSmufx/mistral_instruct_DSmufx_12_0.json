In other words, the smip cannot both be lupped and shripped at the same time.\n2. \"It's not the case that the smip must be lupped\": This statement negates the first condition, meaning that the smip is not required to be lupped.\n\nNow let's consider what we can infer from these statements:\n\nSince the smip cannot be both lupped and shripped at the same time (from the first statement), and it is not required to be lupped (from the second statement), it must be shripped. Therefore, the answer is 'Answer: yes'.",
