To infer \"The whiffle is shanked,\" we would need to know that the only other possibility (tinking) has been ruled out. However, the given statements do not provide enough information to make this conclusion.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The whiffle is shanked\" based on the provided statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
