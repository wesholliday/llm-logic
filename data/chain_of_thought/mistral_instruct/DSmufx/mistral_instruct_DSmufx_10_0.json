It cannot both be garpled and not garpled at the same time, so we can represent this as a disjunction (OR) in logic: W \u2192 G \u2228 S\n2. \"It's not the case that the wug must be garpled\": This statement negates the first statement, meaning that it cannot be the case that the wug must be garpled. In logical terms, this is represented as the negation of the implication (IF...THEN): \u00ac(W \u2192 G)\n\nNow let's consider what we can infer from these two statements:\n\n1. We know that it cannot be the case that the wug must be garpled (it is not forced to be garpled).\n2. However, we also know that there are only two possibilities for the state of the wug: either it is garpled or it is sproinged.\n3. Since it cannot be the case that the wug must be garpled, the only remaining possibility is that the wug is sproinged.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer \"The wug is sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
