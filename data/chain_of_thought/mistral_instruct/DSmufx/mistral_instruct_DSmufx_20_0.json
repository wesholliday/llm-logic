To infer \"The fleeg is bluttered,\" we would need to know that if the fleeg cannot be surned, then it must be bluttered. However, the given statements do not provide enough information to make this assumption.\n4. Therefore, based on the given statements alone, we cannot infer \"The fleeg is bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
