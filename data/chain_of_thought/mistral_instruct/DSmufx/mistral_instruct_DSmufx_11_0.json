However, the disjunction \"Either the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed\" tells us that either condition A or B must be true. Since we know that condition A is false (the flug does not have to be zimmed), then by the principle of contradiction, condition B (it is blummed) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
