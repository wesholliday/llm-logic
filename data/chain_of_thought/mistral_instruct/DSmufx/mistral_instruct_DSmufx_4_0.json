If the fribble must be crinked, then it cannot be snurgled, and vice versa.\n2. \"It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked\": This statement negates the first condition, meaning that the fribble does not have to be crinked.\n3. To infer \"The fribble is snurgled\" from these two statements, we would need to know that if the fribble doesn't have to be crinked, then it must be snurgled. However, there is no information given in the statements that supports this conclusion.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer \"The fribble is snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
