(This statement can be read as \"The sprocket is either daggled or cranked.\")\nStatement 2: It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled. (This statement can be read as \"The sprocket is not necessarily daggled.\")\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given statements\n\nSince Statement 1 states that the sprocket can be either daggled or cranked, and Statement 2 denies that it must be daggled, it does not follow directly that the sprocket is cranked. The two statements are not contradictory but rather complementary. They both indicate that the sprocket can be in one of two states: daggled or cranked.\n\nStep 3: Conclude based on given information\n\nAnswer: No.",
