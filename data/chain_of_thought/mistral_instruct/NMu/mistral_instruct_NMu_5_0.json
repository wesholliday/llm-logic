The negation of a statement implying an action (\"Jeff must have played basketball\") does not necessarily mean the opposite action is true (\"Jeff definitely did not play basketball\"), but rather that the statement is not required to be true. Therefore, it's possible that Jeff didn't play basketball, but it's also possible that some other explanation exists for why he wasn't required to have played. Thus, we can only infer that he might not have played, not that he definitely did not.",
