The negation of a statement implying that something is not required or necessary implies that it is possible for the contrary to be true. In this case, if it's not required that the dog was inside, then it could very well be that the dog was outside. Therefore, \"The dog might not have been inside\" follows logically from \"It's not the case that the dog must have been inside\". Answer: yes.",
