However, Statement 1 only suggests a possibility that the smonk might not be plagged, but it does not confirm that the smonk is definitely not plagged.\n\nStep 3: Consider all possible scenarios\n\nScenario 1: The smonk is plagged\nIn this case, Statement 2 does not apply since we are given that the smonk is already plagged. Therefore, the statement \"Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled\" does not add any new information in this scenario.\n\nScenario 2: The smonk is not plagged and is vreebled\nIn this case, Statement 1 and Statement 2 both apply since we have been given that the smonk might not be plagged (implying it could be vreebled), and Statement 2 states that if the smonk is not plagged, then it must be vreebled.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot directly infer that \"The smonk is vreebled\" because Statement 1 only suggests a possibility that the smonk might not be plagged, but it does not confirm that the smonk is definitely not plagged. However, if we consider the implication of Statement 2, then yes, we can infer that \"The smonk is vreebled\" if we know that it is not plagged.\n\nAnswer: Maybe (with the additional information from Statement 2).",
