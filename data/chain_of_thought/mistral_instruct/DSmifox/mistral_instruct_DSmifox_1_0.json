The first statement is \"The flugel might not be zargled.\" This means that there is a possibility that the flugel is not zargled.\n2. The second statement is \"Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed.\" This statement sets up two mutually exclusive possibilities: either the flugel is zargled, or it is blimmed.\n3. However, neither statement directly states that the flugel is blimmed when the flugel is not zargled. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The flugel is blimmed\" from the given statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
