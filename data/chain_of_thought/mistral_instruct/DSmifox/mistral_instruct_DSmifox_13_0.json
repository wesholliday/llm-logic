However, Statement 2 states that there are only two possibilities for the glip - either it has been dragged or it has been logged. Since Statement 1 does not rule out the possibility of the glip being logged, it does not contradict Statement 2.\n\nStep 3: Conclusion\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer that 'The glip is slogged'. Instead, both possibilities (tragged and slogged) remain open.\n\nAnswer: no.",
