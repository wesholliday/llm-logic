The first statement is \"The fleeg might not be surned.\" This means that there is a possibility that the fleeg is not surned (whatever that means in this context). It does not necessarily mean that the fleeg is bluttered, as the second statement suggests another possibility.\n2. The second statement is \"Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered.\" This statement sets up a dichotomy: either the fleeg is surned, or it is bluttered. However, it does not necessarily mean that if the fleeg is not surned, then it must be bluttered. It only means that those are the two possibilities.\n3. To infer that \"The fleeg is bluttered\" from the given statements, we would need to have enough information to conclude that if the fleeg is not surned, then it must be bluttered. However, the given statements do not provide us with that information. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that \"The fleeg is bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
