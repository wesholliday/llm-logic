It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked. This statement means that there is at least one way to deal with the fribble that does not involve crinking it.\n2. Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked. This statement presents two alternatives: either the fribble is snurgled, or it must be crinked.\n\nNow let's consider these statements together:\n\n1. We know that it's not necessary to crink the fribble.\n2. The second statement tells us that there are only two possibilities: either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked.\n3. Since we already know that it's not necessary to crink the fribble, this means that the first alternative (the fribble being snurgled) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
