The first statement is \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked.\" This means that there are situations where the splat does not need to be quanked (quanked being an action).\n2. The second statement is \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked.\" This statement presents two alternatives: either the splat undergoes a transformation called morphing, or it requires the action of being quanked.\n3. Since we know from the first statement that there are situations where the splat does not need to be quanked, it follows that in those situations, the splat must be morphed instead.\n4. Therefore, if we have a situation where the splat is not quanked, we can infer that it is morphed based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
