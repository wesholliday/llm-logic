This statement means that there is no obligation or requirement for the flob to be moved.\n2. Either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated. This statement presents two alternatives: either the flob is in a state of being skizzled, or it must be moved.\n\nNow let's consider if we can infer that \"The flob is skizzled\" from these statements:\n\nSince \"It's not the case that the flob must be movated\" means there's no requirement for the flob to be moved, this statement does not contradict the alternative \"it must be movated\" in \"Either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated.\" Therefore, both statements can hold true at the same time.\n\nHowever, the given statements do not provide enough information to infer definitively whether the flob is actually skizzled or not. They only tell us that either skizzling or moving the flob are possibilities.\n\nAnswer: No.",
