This means that only one of these alternatives can be true at a time.\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of each alternative\n\nIf the first alternative, \"the shank is plooked,\" is true, then according to the second statement, it would not be necessary to nug the shank. In this case, both statements could coexist without contradiction.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the available information and make a conclusion\n\nGiven that Statement 1 asserts that it's not necessary to nug the shank, it aligns with the first alternative in Statement 2. Therefore, if we assume that the shank is plooked, both statements can be true simultaneously.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
