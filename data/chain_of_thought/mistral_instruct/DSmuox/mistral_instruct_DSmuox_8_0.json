Either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled.\n\nLet's analyze these statements step by step:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled\" means that there are situations where the sprocket is not daggled.\n2. \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled\" means that in some cases, the sprocket can be cranked instead of being daggled. However, it also implies that there might still be cases where the sprocket must be daggled.\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that there are situations where the sprocket is not daggled, and statement 2 tells us that in some cases, the sprocket can be cranked instead of being daggled, it's possible for the sprocket to be cranked in those specific situations. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The sprocket is always cranked', but we can infer that 'In some situations, the sprocket is cranked'.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot directly infer that 'The sprocket is always or necessarily cranked' based on the given statements. However, we can infer that 'In some situations, the sprocket is cranked'.",
