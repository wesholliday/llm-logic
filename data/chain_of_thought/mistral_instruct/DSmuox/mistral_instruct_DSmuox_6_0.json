This means that at least one of the two conditions must be true. However, Statement 1 contradicts the first part of Statement 2 by stating that it's not the case that the grommet must be plopped.\n\nStep 3: Determine if we can infer 'The grommet is sploffed'\n\nSince Statement 1 contradicts the first part of Statement 2, and Statement 2 is a disjunction, it means that Statement 1 cannot be true if Statement 2 is true in its entirety. Therefore, the only way for both statements to be true is if the second part of Statement 2 (the grommet being sploffed) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
