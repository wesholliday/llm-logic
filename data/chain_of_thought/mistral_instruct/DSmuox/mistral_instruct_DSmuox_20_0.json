It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned. This statement means that it is not necessary for the fleeg to be surned (whatever that means in this context).\n2. Either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned. This statement means that there are two possibilities: either the fleeg is bluttered, or it must be surned.\n\nNow let's consider these statements together to see if we can infer that \"The fleeg is bluttered\":\n\nSince \"it's not the case that the fleeg must be surned\" means that it's possible for the fleeg not to be surned, and since \"either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned\" gives us two possibilities, neither of which requires that the fleeg must necessarily be surned, we cannot infer that \"The fleeg is bluttered\" based on these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
