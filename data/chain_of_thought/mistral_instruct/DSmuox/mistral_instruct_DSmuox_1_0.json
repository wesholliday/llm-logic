It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled. This statement means that zargling the flugel is not a requirement.\n2. Either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled. This statement presents two possibilities: either the flugel is blimmed, or it must be zargled.\n\nNow let's consider if we can infer that \"The flugel is blimmed\" based on these statements:\n\nSince \"It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled\" means that zargling the flugel is not a requirement, it does not contradict the statement \"Either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled.\" In fact, both statements can be true at the same time. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The flugel is blimmed\" based on these given statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
