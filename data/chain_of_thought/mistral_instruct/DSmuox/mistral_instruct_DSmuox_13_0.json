However, we know from the first statement that there is an alternative to \"tragging\" the glip, so it cannot be the case that \"it must be tragged.\"\n4. Since both statements cannot be true at the same time, and we have determined that the second statement cannot be true given the first statement, we can infer that \"The glip is not slogged.\"\n5. Therefore, the opposite of what was asked in the question is the answer.\n\nAnswer: no (actually, the answer is 'no' to 'The glip is slogged', but since the question asks if we can infer it from the given statements, the answer is 'no' to that as well).",
