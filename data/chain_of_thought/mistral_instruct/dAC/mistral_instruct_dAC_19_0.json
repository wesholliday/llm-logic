We have two conditional statements:\n   a) If Tom watches football, then Jen watches basketball (If p, then q).\n   b) Jen watched basketball (q).\n\n2. To determine if we can deduce \"Tom watched football\" (p), we need to apply the rules of logical implication:\n\n   a) From 'If p, then q' and 'q', we can infer 'p' only if we know that 'p' implies 'q' via a valid rule (e.g., modus ponens). However, in this case, we don't have enough information to directly apply modus ponens since the given conditional statement \"If Tom watches football, then Jen watches basketball\" does not necessarily mean that Tom always watches football whenever Jen watches basketball.\n\n3. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot deduce \"Tom watched football\" with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no.",
