However, it does not directly state that the cake is chocolate. The second statement only confirms that the muffins are blueberry.\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of each statement\n\nStatement 1 implies that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. Statement 2 confirms that the muffins are blueberry. But it does not provide any information about the cake.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the deductive reasoning\n\nTo deduce 'The cake was chocolate' from 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' and 'The muffins were blueberry', we would need an additional piece of information that directly states or implies that the cake is chocolate. Since there is no such statement given, we cannot make this deduction based on the provided information alone.\n\nStep 5: Provide the answer\n\nAnswer: No.",
