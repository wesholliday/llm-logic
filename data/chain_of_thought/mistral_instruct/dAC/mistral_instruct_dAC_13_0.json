            "content": " Step 1: Understand the given statements\n\nStatement 1: If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\nStatement 2: The truck was blue.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given statements\n\nThe second statement tells us that the truck is blue. However, the first statement tells us that if the car is red, then the truck is blue. This means that the truth of the second statement (truck being blue) depends on the truth or falsehood of the first statement (car being red).\n\nStep 3: Consider possible scenarios\n\nScenario 1: The car is red and the truck is blue (as stated in both conditions). In this case, the given statements are consistent.\n\nScenario 2: The car is not red but the truck is still blue. In this case, the first statement is false, while the second statement is true.\n\nStep 4: Determine if we can deduce 'The car was red' from the given statements\n\nSince the truth of the second statement (truck being blue) depends on the truth or falsehood of the first statement (car being red), we cannot definitively conclude that 'The car was red' based on the given statements alone. There is a possibility that both statements are true, but it is also possible for one statement to be false while the other is true.\n\nAnswer: No.",
