We have two conditional statements:\n   a) If Sue chooses pizza, then Bob chooses pasta (Let's call this statement A).\n   b) Bob chooses pasta (Let's call this statement B).\n\n2. To determine if we can deduce \"Sue chose pizza\" from these statements, let's consider the following scenarios:\n\n   a) Scenario 1: Sue chooses pizza and Bob chooses pasta (This scenario satisfies both A and B).\n      In this case, yes, we can deduce that Sue chose pizza.\n\n   b) Scenario 2: Sue does not choose pizza and Bob chooses pasta (This scenario also satisfies B but not A).\n      In this case, no, we cannot deduce that Sue chose pizza based on the given statements alone.\n\n3. Based on our analysis of the scenarios, we can conclude that while it is possible for Sue to have chosen pizza, the given statements do not definitively prove that she did. Therefore, we cannot deduce \"Sue chose pizza\" with certainty from \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" and \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
