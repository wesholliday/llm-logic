We have two conditional statements: If p (Joe went to the park), then q (Lucy went to the zoo).\n2. We also know that q is true (Lucy went to the zoo).\n3. To determine if p is true, we can use the method of contradiction. Let's assume p is false (Joe didn't go to the park), and see if this leads to a contradiction with our given information.\n4. If Joe didn't go to the park, then according to the first statement, Lucy wouldn't have gone to the zoo. However, we know that Lucy did go to the zoo, which is a contradiction with our assumption that Joe didn't go to the park.\n5. Since our assumption led to a contradiction, it must be that Joe went to the park (p is true).\n\nAnswer: yes",
