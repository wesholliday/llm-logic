We have two conditional statements:\n   a) If p (the book was written by James), then q (the book is a mystery novel).\n   b) Q (the book is a mystery novel).\n\n2. To determine if we can deduce p (The book was written by James), we need to apply the rule of Modus Ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement \"If p then q\" and we know that q is true, then p must also be true.\n\n3. In this case, we have \"If p then q\" (the first conditional statement), and we know that q is true (from the second conditional statement). Therefore, according to Modus Ponens, we can deduce that p must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
