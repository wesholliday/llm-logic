If p (Jeff plays basketball), then q (Amy plays tennis).\n2. q (Amy plays tennis) is a fact.\n\nTo find out if p (Jeff plays basketball) is true, we need to apply the Modus Ponens rule of inference:\n\nIf p implies q and q is true, then p must be true.\n\nIn our case:\n- p implies q: If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n- q is true: Amy played tennis.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we can deduce that \"Jeff played basketball\" is a valid conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
