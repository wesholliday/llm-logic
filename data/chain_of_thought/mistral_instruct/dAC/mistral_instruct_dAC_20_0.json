We have two conditional statements: If p (the apple is red) then q (the banana is yellow), and q (the banana is yellow).\n2. To determine if we can deduce p (the apple is red), we need to apply the rules of logical implication.\n3. The first rule states that from 'If p then q' and 'q', we cannot directly infer 'p'. This is known as the failure of the converse property in logic.\n4. However, if we have additional information that guarantees the truth of p (the apple being red), then we can validly conclude it using the given statements.\n5. In this case, we do not have any such additional information.\n6. Therefore, based on the given statements alone, we cannot deduce \"The apple was red.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
