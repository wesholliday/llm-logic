However, the converse is not necessarily true - just because the truck is metal does not mean that the doll is plastic.\n\nStep 3: Consider the given statements in relation to each other\n\nThe second statement tells us that the truck is metal. But we don't know anything about the doll from the given information. Therefore, even though we know that if the doll was plastic, then the truck would have to be metal - we cannot deduce that the doll is plastic based on the given statements alone.\n\nStep 4: Conclude and answer the question\n\nAnswer: No.",
