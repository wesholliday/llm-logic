But we don't know what \"surned\" is or how it relates to \"bluttered.\"\n2. \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\": This conditional statement tells us that if the fleeg was in a state of being bluttered, then something else (surned) also occurred. But we don't know what caused the fleeg to be bluttered or what \"surned\" means.\n\nWithout more context or information about the meaning of \"bluttered\" and \"surned,\" it is not possible to infer \"The fleeg surned\" from these two statements alone. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no.",
