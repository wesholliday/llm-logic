We have two statements: \"The twonk was plinked\" and \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\"\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first condition (the twonk being plinked) is true, then the second condition (it being varnished) must also be true.\n3. However, we don't have any information about whether the twonk being plinked actually caused it to be varnished or if there could be other reasons why it was varnished.\n4. Therefore, even though the conditional statement tells us that if the twonk is plinked, then it must be varnished, we cannot infer for certain that \"It was varnished\" based on just these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
