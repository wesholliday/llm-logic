We have two statements: a) The fribble was snurgled\n   b) If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it describes a relationship between two events or propositions. In this case, the first proposition (the fribble being snurgled) is the condition, and the second proposition (the fribble crinked) is the consequence.\n\n3. To infer that \"The fribble crinked\" from \"The fribble was snurgled,\" we need to establish that the condition in the conditional statement has occurred. In this case, we have been told that it has (statement a).\n\n4. Since the condition of the conditional statement has been established, and the conditional statement itself asserts that the consequence follows from the condition, we can infer that \"The fribble crinked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
