'If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked': This statement is a conditional statement, meaning if the premise (the splat was morphed) is true, then the conclusion (the splat must have quanked) must also be true.\n2. 'It's not the case that the splat must have quanked': This statement negates the conclusion of the first conditional statement. It states that even if the splat was morphed, it did not necessarily have to quank.\n3. To infer 'The splat was not morphed', we would need to have a contradiction or a clear negation of the premise (the splat was morphed). However, we don't have that in our given statements.\n4. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer 'The splat was not morphed'.\n\nAnswer: no.",
