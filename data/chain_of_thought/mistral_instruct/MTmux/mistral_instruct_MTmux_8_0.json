However, the second statement states that it's not necessarily true that the sprocket was daggled when it was cranked.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possibilities\n\nThere are three possible scenarios based on the given statements:\n\n1) The sprocket is not cranked at all. In this case, neither statement applies.\n2) The sprocket is cranked and it is daggled. This satisfies both statements.\n3) The sprocket is cranked but it is not daggled. This contradicts the first statement.\n\nStep 4: Determine the answer based on available information\n\nSince the second statement tells us that it's not necessarily true that the sprocket was daggled when it was cranked, it means that there is a possibility that the sprocket was cranked without being daggled. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The sprocket was not cranked'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
