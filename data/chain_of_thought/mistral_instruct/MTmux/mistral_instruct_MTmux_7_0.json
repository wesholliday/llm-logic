If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked. (This statement implies that if a whiffle is shanked, it will result in a 'tink' sound.)\n2. It's not the case that the whiffle must have tinked. (This statement implies that there was no 'tink' sound when the whiffle was hit.)\n\nNow let's consider these statements together:\n\n1. If a shanked whiffle results in a 'tink' sound, and we know there was no 'tink' sound, then it follows logically that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
