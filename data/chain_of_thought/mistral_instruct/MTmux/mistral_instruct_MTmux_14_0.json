If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged (given statement)\n2. It's not the case that the clug must have been snugged (given statement)\n\nLet's analyze these statements to see if we can infer 'The clug was not fleeked':\n\n1. The first statement tells us that if the clug was fleeked, then it must have also been snugged. This creates a conditional relationship between the two actions (fleeking and snugging).\n2. The second statement tells us that it's not the case that the clug must have been snugged. This means that there is at least one situation where the clug was not snugged.\n3. However, this statement does not directly address the status of the clug being fleeked or not. It only tells us that the clug was not necessarily snugged.\n4. Since we cannot definitively determine if the clug was fleeked based on the given information, and there is at least one situation where it was not snugged, we cannot infer 'The clug was not fleeked' with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no.",
