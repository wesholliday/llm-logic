If the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed. (This is a conditional statement.)\n2. It's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed. (This statement negates the conclusion of the first statement.)\n\nNow let's consider what we can infer from these statements:\n\n1. We cannot directly infer \"The flug was not blummed\" based on the given information alone, because the statements do not explicitly state that the flug was not blummed or zimmed.\n2. However, since the second statement negates the conclusion of the first statement, it follows that at least one situation exists where the flug is not zimmed even though it could have been blummed. This means that there is a possibility that the flug was not blummed in the first place.\n3. Therefore, while we cannot definitively infer \"The flug was not blummed\" based on the given statements alone, we can infer that it's possible that the flug was not blummed.\n\nAnswer: Yes (it's possible that the flug was not blummed).",
