If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged. (Let's call this statement A.)\n2. It's not the case that the glip must have tragged. (Let's call this statement B.)\n\nFrom statement A, we know that if the glip is slogged, then it must be true that the glip tragged. However, from statement B, we know that it's not the case that the glip must have tragged. This means that there are situations where the glip is not slogged or is slogged but does not trag.\n\nSince both statements cannot be true at the same time (if the glip is slogged, then it must trag according to statement A, but we know from statement B that it's not always the case that the glip trag when it's slogged), one of them must be false. Since we are trying to infer 'The glip was not slogged', and this is a negation of statement A, if we can prove that statement A is false, then we will have proven our inference.\n\nTo show that statement A is false, let's consider a counterexample where the glip is slogged but does not trag. This would be a situation where both statements A and B are true at the same time (the glip is slogged but does not trag), which means that neither statement can logically imply the other. In this case, we cannot infer 'The glip was not slogged' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no.",
