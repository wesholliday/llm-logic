If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled. (This is a conditional statement.)\n2. It's not the case that the wug must have been garpled. (This statement negates the conclusion of the first statement.)\n\nNow let's consider what these statements mean:\n\n1. The first statement implies that if the wug was sproinged, then garpling it is a necessary consequence. In other words, whenever a wug is sproinged, it is also garpled.\n2. The second statement asserts that the wug was not garpled (it negates the conclusion of the first statement). However, it does not directly address the status of the wug being sproinged or not.\n\nGiven this information, we cannot definitively infer 'The wug was not sproinged' based on the given statements alone. The second statement only tells us that the wug was not garpled, but it does not necessarily mean that the wug was not sproinged in the first place.\n\nAnswer: no.",
