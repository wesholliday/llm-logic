If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink. (This is a conditional statement.)\n2. It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink. (This statement negates the conclusion of the first statement.)\n\nNow let's consider what we can infer from these statements:\n\n1. The first statement tells us that if the grommet was sploffed, then the frink was plopped. This is a cause-and-effect relationship.\n2. The second statement tells us that it's not the case that the frink was plopped (the conclusion of the first statement is negated).\n3. However, the second statement does not directly address the grommet being sploffed or not. It only negates the effect (frink being plopped) of the cause (grommet being sploffed) stated in the first condition.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer \"The grommet was not sploffed\" with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no.",
