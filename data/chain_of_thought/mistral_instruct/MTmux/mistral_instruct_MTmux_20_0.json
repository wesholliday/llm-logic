If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned. (This is statement 1.)\n2. It's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned. (This is statement 2.)\n\nNow let's consider what each statement means:\n\nStatement 1 implies that if the fleeg was bluttered (wet or covered in something), then it had to be surned (dipped or coated with something else).\n\nStatement 2 states that it is not the case that the fleeg must have been surned, meaning that there is at least one instance where the fleeg was not surned despite being bluttered.\n\nSince statement 2 contradicts statement 1 by introducing a situation where the fleeg was bluttered but not surned, it follows that the statements cannot both be true simultaneously. Therefore, we can infer that at least one of them is false.\n\nHowever, without more context or information, it's impossible to definitively determine which statement is false. It could be that statement 1 is incorrect (the fleeg doesn't always need to be surned when it's bluttered), or statement 2 is incorrect (there are instances where the fleeg is both bluttered and surned).\n\nTo answer the question directly, we cannot infer \"The fleeg was not bluttered\" based on the given statements alone. Instead, we can only conclude that one of the statements is false.\n\nAnswer: no.",
