'If the car was red, then the truck was blue': This statement is a conditional statement. It means that under the condition that the car is red, the truck is blue. It does not guarantee that the car is red or that the truck is blue; it only establishes a relationship between the two statements.\n2. 'The truck was blue': This statement is true and indicates that the truck has a blue color.\n3. However, the given statements do not provide any information about the color of the car. Therefore, even though we know that if the car were red, then the truck would be blue, we cannot conclude that the car is actually red based on the given information alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
