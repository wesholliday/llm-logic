A valid implication means that whenever the premise (the condition) is true, the conclusion must also be true. In this case, we have two propositions:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n2. The banana was yellow.\n\nTo check if these two propositions imply that the apple was red, we can use a truth table or apply the rules of logic directly. Since the second proposition is given as true, and the first proposition states that \"if\" the apple is red, \"then\" the banana is yellow, it follows logically that the apple must be red for the second proposition to hold true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: yes.",
