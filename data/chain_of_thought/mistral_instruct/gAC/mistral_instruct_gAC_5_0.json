The conditional statement tells us that whenever Jeff plays basketball, Amy plays tennis. We know that Amy played tennis, so we can infer that Jeff must have played basketball at some point for this condition to be met.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, \"Jeff played basketball\" is a logical conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
