We know that \"The cat was outside\" is true.\n2. From the given conditional statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\", we can infer that if the cat was outside, then the dog cannot be inside (because the condition for the cat to be outside is that the dog is inside).\n3. Therefore, since we know that \"The cat was outside\" is true, it follows that \"The dog was inside\" must be false.\n\nAnswer: no.",
