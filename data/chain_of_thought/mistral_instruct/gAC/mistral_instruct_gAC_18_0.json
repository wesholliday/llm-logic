We know that 'The truck was metal' is true.\n2. From 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal', we can infer that if the doll were plastic, then the truck would have to be metal according to the given condition.\n3. However, we don't have any information about the material of the doll in our premises.\n4. Since the truth of 'The doll was plastic' is not established, and the conditional statement only establishes a relationship between the doll being plastic and the truck being metal, it does not follow that 'The doll was plastic' is true based on the given information alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
