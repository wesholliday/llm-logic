            "content": " To determine if \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true given that \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true and \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true, we can use the concept of a conditional statement.\n\nA conditional statement has the form \"If P, then Q.\" This means that if P is true, then Q must also be true. In this case, P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt,\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nWe are given that both \"P\" (Lisa bought the red shirt) and \"Q\" (Mark bought the blue shirt) are part of a conditional statement, so we know that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. We are also given that Mark did indeed buy the blue shirt.\n\nTo determine if Lisa must have also bought the red shirt, we can use the truth table for a conditional statement:\n\n| P | Q | P -> Q |\n|---|---|---|\n| T | T | T  |\n| T | F | F  |\n| F | T | T  |\n| F | F | T  |\n\nIn our case, we know that both P and Q are true. According to the truth table, if both P and Q are true, then \"P -> Q\" (the conditional statement) must also be true. Therefore, since we know that \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true and \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true, it follows that \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
