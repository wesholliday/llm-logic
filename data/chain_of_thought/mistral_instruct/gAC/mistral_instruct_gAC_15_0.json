Given 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train', this statement represents a conditional statement where the if-part (Sam took a plane) is the premise and the then-part (Erin took a train) is the conclusion.\n2. For this conditional statement to be true, both parts must hold true when the premise is true. In other words, whenever Sam takes a plane, Erin must take a train for the conditional statement to be true.\n3. We are given that 'Erin took a train' is true. This means the conclusion of the original conditional statement holds true.\n4. Since the conclusion holds true and the conditional statement is true by definition, it follows that the premise (Sam took a plane) must also be true for the entire statement to hold true.\n5. Answer: yes.",
