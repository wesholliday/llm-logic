            "content": " To determine if \"Tom watched football\" is true given that \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is true and \"Jen watched basketball\" is true, we can use the concept of a conditional statement (if-then statement) and the truth table for logical operators.\n\n1. We have two statements: A) If Tom watches football, then Jen watches basketball.\nB) Jen watched basketball.\n\n2. To analyze this situation, let's assume we create a truth table with two variables: P (Tom watches football) and Q (Jen watches basketball).\n\n3. Since the first statement is an if-then statement, it can be represented as P \u2192 Q.\n\n4. Let's fill in the truth table for this conditional statement:\n\n| P   | Q   | P \u2192 Q |\n|---|---|---|\n| F   | F   | T   |\n| F   | T   | T   |\n| T   | F   | F   |\n| T   | T   | T   |\n\n5. The truth table shows that for a conditional statement P \u2192 Q to be true, both P and Q must be true or P is false and Q is true.\n\n6. In our given situation, we have Q (Jen watched basketball) as true. To find out if Tom watched football (P), we need to check the truth table for this combination: P = T and Q = T.\n\n7. According to the truth table, when both P and Q are true, then P \u2192 Q is also true.\n\n8. Therefore, based on the given information, it can be inferred that Tom watched football (Answer: yes).",
