We have two given statements:\n   a) If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter (implication).\n   b) The robot visited Jupiter (fact).\n\n2. To determine if 'The alien visited Mars' is true, we can use the rule of Modus Ponens, which states that if an implication (if p, then q) and the premise p are true, then the conclusion q must also be true.\n\n3. In our case, p is 'The alien visited Mars', and q is 'The robot visited Jupiter'. Since we know that both the given implications and facts are true, applying Modus Ponens would mean that 'The alien visited Mars' (p) must also be true to make 'The robot visited Jupiter' (q) true.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
