If p (griffin is in the forest), then q (unicorn is in the forest)\n2. q (unicorn is in the forest)\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if p is true, then q must also be true. The second statement states that q is indeed true.\n\nTo determine if p is true, we can use the method of contradiction. We'll assume that p is false and see if we can derive a logical contradiction from our given statements.\n\nAssume p is false: The griffin was not in the forest.\n\nFrom statement 1, since p is false, then q must be false as well (according to the conditional statement). But statement 2 states that q is true. This creates a contradiction because we assumed p to be false and derived both p and its negation to be false.\n\nSince our assumption led to a contradiction, it means that our assumption was incorrect, and therefore p must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes. The griffin was in the forest.",
