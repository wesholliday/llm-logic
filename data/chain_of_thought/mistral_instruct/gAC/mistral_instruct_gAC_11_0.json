'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry': This statement is a conditional statement. It means that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. It does not guarantee that the cake is chocolate or that the muffins are blueberry; it only establishes a relationship between them.\n2. 'The muffins were blueberry': This statement is true and indicates that the muffins were indeed blueberry.\n3. However, we cannot directly infer that the cake was chocolate based on these statements alone. The conditional statement only tells us that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry; it does not guarantee that the cake is chocolate.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: no.",
