We know that \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is a conditional statement.\n2. We also know that \"Bob chose pasta\" is a fact.\n3. To determine if \"Sue chose pizza\" is true, we need to apply the rule of Modus Ponens (MP) for this conditional statement. MP states that if a conditional statement \"If p, then q\" is true and p is true, then q must be true.\n4. In our case, p represents \"Sue chose pizza,\" and q represents \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n5. Since we know that \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is a true conditional statement and \"Bob chose pasta\" is a fact, it follows that \"Sue chose pizza\" must be true as well to make the entire conditional statement hold.\n\nAnswer: yes",
