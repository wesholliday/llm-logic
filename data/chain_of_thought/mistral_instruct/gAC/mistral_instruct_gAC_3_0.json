We know that \"The book is a mystery novel\" is true.\n2. From this fact, we also know that \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is true because the conditional statement is true whenever its consequent (the book being a mystery novel) is already known to be true.\n3. To determine if \"The book was written by James\" is true, we need to check if the antecedent of the conditional statement is also true. In other words, we need to find out if James actually wrote the book.\n4. Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to definitively say whether or not James wrote the book, so we cannot make a conclusive determination based on the given statements alone.\n5. Therefore, the answer is: Answer: no.",
