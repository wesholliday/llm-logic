However, this does not necessarily mean that the missing puzzle piece is in the box. The second statement only eliminates one of the possibilities given in the first statement.\n\nStep 5: To determine if we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box based on the two statements given, we need to consider any additional information or context that might be relevant. Without such information, we cannot make this conclusion based solely on the two statements provided.\n\nAnswer: No.",
