We have two statements: 'Either the jacket must be hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair' and 'It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet'.\n2. The first statement tells us that there are only two possibilities for the jacket's location: either it's hanging in the closet or draped over the chair.\n3. The second statement informs us that the jacket cannot be hanging in the closet, so it must be somewhere else.\n4. Since we know that the jacket cannot be hanging in the closet and there are no other known locations for the jacket, the only remaining possibility is that it's draped over the chair.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The jacket is draped over the chair'.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
