We have two statements:\n   a) Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer\n   b) It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\n2. Let's analyze each statement:\n   a) \"Either\" means one of two things is true. In this case, it means either the keys are dangling or they are in the drawer.\n   b) \"It's not the case that\" negates the statement following it. So, it negates \"the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n3. Since we know that the keys cannot be dangling in the cabinet (statement b), then the only remaining option is that they must be in the drawer (from statement a).\n4. Therefore, we can infer \"The keys are in the drawer.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
