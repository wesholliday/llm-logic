This statement tells us that the phone can only be in one of two places - either it's ringing in the kitchen or it's in the living room. It does not necessarily mean that the phone is currently ringing.\n\nStep 3: Now let's look at Statement 2. This statement tells us that the phone is not currently ringing in the kitchen.\n\nStep 4: Since Statement 1 does not require the phone to be ringing at this moment, and Statement 2 only states that it's not ringing in the kitchen, we cannot directly infer that the phone is in the living room based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
