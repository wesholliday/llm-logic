The statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" means that the toy is not on the bookshelf.\n3. Since we know that the toy cannot be on the bookshelf, and it can only be either on the bookshelf or in the toy box, then the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
