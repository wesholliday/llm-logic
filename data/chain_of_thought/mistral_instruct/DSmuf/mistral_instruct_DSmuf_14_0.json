We have two statements:\n   a) Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter.\n   b) It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\n2. Let's analyze each statement:\n   a) The first statement tells us that there are only two possibilities for the milk: either it's chilling in the fridge or it's on the counter. This is an exhaustive list of possibilities, meaning that if the milk is neither chilling nor on the counter, then this statement would be false.\n   b) The second statement tells us that the milk is not chilling in the fridge.\n3. Now let's consider what we can infer from these statements:\n   - Since the first statement lists all possible scenarios for the milk, and the second statement tells us that the milk is not chilling in the fridge, it follows logically that the milk must be on the counter (as there are no other possibilities).\n4. Answer: yes.",
