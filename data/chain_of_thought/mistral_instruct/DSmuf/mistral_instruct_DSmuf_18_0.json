This means that one of the two conditions must be true.\n\nStep 3: The second statement, \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand,\" negates the first condition.\n\nStep 4: Since the first condition is a disjunction, we cannot directly infer that the second statement makes the entire disjunction false. However, if we assume that the notebook is neither on the nightstand nor in the drawer (which would make both statements false), then we create a contradiction because one of the two conditions must be true according to the given information.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the notebook must be in the drawer since the other condition (it being on the nightstand) has been negated and cannot both be false at the same time.\n\nAnswer: yes",
