The statement \"Either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser\" means that the only two possible locations for the watch are on the wrist or on the dresker for charging.\n2. The statement \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist\" indicates that the watch is not currently being worn on the wrist.\n3. Since we know that the watch cannot be on the wrist, and we also know that it can only be in one of two locations (either on the wrist or on the dresser for charging), then the logical conclusion would be that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
