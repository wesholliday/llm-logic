This statement does not provide any information about the presence or absence of other animals like the bear in the cave.\n\nStatement 2 establishes a conditional relationship between the presence of the bear and the wolf in the den. It suggests that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den. However, it does not guarantee that the bear was actually present in the cave.\n\nStep 3: Consider the logical implications of both statements together\n\nThe first statement (wolf might not have been in the den) does not directly contradict the second statement (if bear is in the cave, then wolf must have been in the den). However, it does introduce an element of uncertainty regarding the presence or absence of the wolf in the den.\n\nThe second statement only establishes a conditional relationship between the presence of the bear and the wolf in the den. It does not guarantee that the bear was actually present in the cave.\n\nStep 4: Determine if we can infer 'The bear was not in the cave' based on the given statements\n\nGiven the information provided, it is impossible to infer 'The bear was not in the cave'. The first statement introduces uncertainty about the presence of the wolf in the den, while the second statement only establishes a conditional relationship between the presence of the bear and the wolf. Neither statement directly addresses the presence or absence of the bear in the cave.\n\nAnswer: no.",
