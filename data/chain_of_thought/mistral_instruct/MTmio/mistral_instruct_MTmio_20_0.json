It only suggests that the banana could have been a different color than yellow.\n\nStatement 2 is a conditional statement, stating that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. This means that the two statements are related, but it does not necessarily mean that the apple was actually red or that the banana was actually yellow.\n\nStep 3: Consider the combination of both statements\n\nThe first statement does not allow us to infer the color of either the apple or the banana with certainty. The second statement tells us that if the apple were red, then the banana would have had to be yellow. However, it does not provide any information about the actual colors of the fruits.\n\nStep 4: Determine what can be inferred from the given statements\n\nBased on the given statements alone, we cannot infer that the apple was not red. The statements only tell us that if the apple had been red, then the banana would have had to be yellow. They do not provide enough information to make any definitive conclusions about the colors of either fruit.\n\nAnswer: no.",
