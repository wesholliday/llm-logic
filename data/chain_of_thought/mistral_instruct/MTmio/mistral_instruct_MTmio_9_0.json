It only tells us that there is a possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of Statement 2\n\nStatement 2 states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This means that the purchase of the red shirt by Lisa would be contingent upon Mark buying the blue shirt.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the combination of both statements\n\nGiven Statement 1 and Statement 2, we cannot infer that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" with certainty. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then according to Statement 2, Mark would have had to buy the blue shirt as well. However, Statement 1 only suggests that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, it does not definitively state that he didn't. Therefore, there is still a possibility that both Lisa and Mark made purchases \u2013 Lisa bought the red shirt, and Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: no.",
