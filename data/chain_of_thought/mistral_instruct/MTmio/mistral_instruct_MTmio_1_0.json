The second statement establishes a conditional relationship between Mary and Sue's presence at the wedding. It states that if Mary was present, then Sue must have been as well.\n\nStep 3: Consider the logical implications of the given statements\n\nGiven Statement 1, it is possible for both Mary and Sue to not be present at the wedding. However, Statement 2 contradicts this possibility by stating that if Mary was present, then Sue must also have been there. This creates a conflict between the two statements.\n\nStep 4: Determine if we can infer 'Mary was not at the wedding' based on the given statements\n\nSince the given statements create a logical conflict, it is impossible to determine definitively whether or not Mary was not at the wedding based on the information provided alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
