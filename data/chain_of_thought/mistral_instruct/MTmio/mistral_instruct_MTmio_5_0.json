It only suggests that Amy may not have played tennis.\n\nStatement 2 creates a conditional relationship between Jeff's basketball play and Amy's tennis play. If Jeff plays basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\n\nStep 3: Consider the combination of both statements.\n\nThe first statement does not provide enough information to infer that Jeff did not play basketball based on Statement 2 alone. The conditional statement in Statement 2 only establishes a relationship between Jeff's basketball play and Amy's tennis play, but it doesn't directly exclude the possibility of both Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis.\n\nAnswer: No.",
