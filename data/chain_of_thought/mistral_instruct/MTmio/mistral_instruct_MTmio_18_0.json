This is a conditional statement with an 'if-then' relationship. It does not directly state or imply anything about the actual properties of the doll or the truck.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possibility of the negation of Statement 1\n\nIf we consider the negation of Statement 1, which is 'The truck was metal', then according to Statement 2, if the doll was plastic, then the truck would have to be metal. However, Statement 1 only states that 'The truck might not have been metal'. It does not state definitively that the truck was not metal.\n\nStep 4: Determine the conclusion based on the given statements\n\nGiven the information provided in the statements, we cannot infer 'The doll was not plastic' based on 'The truck might not have been metal' and 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal'. The second statement only establishes a conditional relationship between the properties of the doll and the truck. It does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion about the actual properties of either the doll or the truck.\n\nAnswer: No.",
