It leaves open the possibility that she could have gone somewhere else instead.\n\nStatement 2 creates a conditional relationship between Joe's action (going to the park) and Lucy's action (going to the zoo). If Joe goes to the park, then Lucy must go to the zoo according to this statement.\n\nStep 3: Consider the combination of both statements\n\nThe first statement does not directly contradict the second statement because Statement 1 allows for the possibility that Lucy did not go to the zoo while Statement 2 states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nStep 4: Determine if we can infer 'Joe did not go to the park' from the given statements\n\nNo, we cannot infer 'Joe did not go to the park' based on the given statements because Statement 2 only establishes a relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo. It does not state that Joe necessarily went to the park or that he could not have gone somewhere else instead.\n\nAnswer: no.",
