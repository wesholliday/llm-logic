It does not definitively rule out the possibility that it could be a mystery novel.\n\nStatement 2 states that if James wrote the book, then it must be a mystery novel. This statement implies that James only writes mystery novels.\n\nStep 3: Now let's consider both statements together.\n\nIf Statement 1 is true (the book might not be a mystery novel), and Statement 2 is also true (James only writes mystery novels), then the book was not written by James, because if it were, it would have to be a mystery novel according to Statement 2, but we know from Statement 1 that it might not be.\n\nAnswer: yes",
