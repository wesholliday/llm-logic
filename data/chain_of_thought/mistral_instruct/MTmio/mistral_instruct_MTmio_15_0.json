It implies that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n\nStep 3: Consider the combination of both statements\n\nThe first statement does not prevent Erin from taking a train; it just leaves open the possibility that she might not have. The second statement states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n\nSince we cannot infer for certain whether Sam took a plane or not, we cannot definitively say whether Erin took a train or not based on these statements alone. Therefore, the given information does not allow us to infer 'Sam did not take a plane'.\n\nAnswer: no.",
