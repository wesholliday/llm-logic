This statement does not provide any information about the actual presence or absence of either creature in the forest.\n\nStep 3: Consider the combination of both statements\n\nSince Statement 1 only suggests a possibility and Statement 2 does not provide any concrete evidence, we cannot infer anything definitive about the presence or absence of griffins based on these two statements alone.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: no.",
