It only mentions that the robot might not have visited Jupiter.\n\nStatement 2 states a conditional relationship between the alien visiting Mars and the robot visiting Jupiter. This means that if the alien visited Mars, then it is a given that the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nStep 3: Consider the combination of both statements\n\nThe first statement does not provide enough information to infer anything about the alien's visit to Mars. The second statement only tells us that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. It does not tell us whether or not the alien actually visited Mars.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot infer 'The alien did not visit Mars'. Answer: no.",
