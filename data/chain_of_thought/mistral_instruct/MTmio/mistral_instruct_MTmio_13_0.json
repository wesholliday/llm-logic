It only suggests that the truck might not have been blue.\n\nStatement 2 establishes a conditional relationship between the colors of the car and the truck. If the car is red, then the truck must be blue.\n\nStep 3: Consider the combination of both statements\n\nThe first statement does not allow us to infer that the car is definitely not red because it doesn't provide enough information about the color of the car.\n\nThe second statement tells us that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. However, this statement does not guarantee that the car is actually red; it only establishes a relationship between the colors of the car and the truck.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\n\nGiven the information provided, we cannot infer 'The car was not red' based on 'The truck might not have been blue' and 'If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue'.\n\nAnswer: no.",
