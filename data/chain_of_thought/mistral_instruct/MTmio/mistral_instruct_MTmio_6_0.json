However, it does not necessarily mean that he didn't. It only implies that pasta was not his definite choice.\n\nStatement 2 establishes a conditional relationship between Sue and Bob's choices. If Sue chooses pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. This statement creates a contradiction with Statement 1 because if Sue chooses pizza, then according to Statement 2, Bob cannot have chosen pasta (since he must have had pasta if Sue had pizza).\n\nStep 3: Consider the logical implications\n\nGiven the information provided, it is not possible to infer that Sue did not choose pizza based on the two statements alone. The reason being that we don't know for sure whether Sue actually chose pizza or not. If she did, then according to Statement 2, Bob couldn't have had pasta, which contradicts Statement 1. But if she didn't, then there is no conflict between the two statements.\n\nStep 4: Provide the answer\n\nAnswer: No.",
