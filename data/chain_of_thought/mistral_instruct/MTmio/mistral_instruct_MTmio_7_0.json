From 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race', it follows that if Alex finished the race, then Chris also finished the race.\n3. However, it does not follow that if Chris did not finish the race, then Alex also did not finish the race. It is possible that both Chris and Alex finished the race at different times or paces.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Alex did not finish the race' from these two statements alone.",
