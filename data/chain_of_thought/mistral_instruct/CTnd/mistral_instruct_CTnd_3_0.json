In other words, it's stating that when I eat a meal, it's not a large one.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given statement for implications.\n\nThe given statement does not imply \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal.\" This is because the two statements are saying different things. The first statement is about the size of the meal when I do eat one, and the second statement is about the absence of a meal when a large meal is eaten. They are related but not equivalent.\n\nStep 3: Conclude.\n\nAnswer: no.",
