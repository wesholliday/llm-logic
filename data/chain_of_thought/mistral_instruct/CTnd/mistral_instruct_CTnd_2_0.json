It suggests that Ann can both exercise and not exercise strenuously at the same time, which is impossible.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given statement to determine if it implies \"If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise.\"\n\nThe given statement does not logically imply \"If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise.\" In fact, they are contradictory statements. The first statement suggests that Ann exercises but not strenuously, while the second statement suggests that if Ann exercises strenuously, then she did not exercise at all. These two statements cannot both be true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: no.",
