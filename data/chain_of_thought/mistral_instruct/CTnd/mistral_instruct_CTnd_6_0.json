            "content": " No, from \"If the clothes were washed, then they were not washed properly,\" we cannot infer \"If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed.\" These two statements are logical opposites. The first statement implies that if the clothes were washed at all, they were not washed to an acceptable standard. The second statement, however, implies that if the clothes were washed properly (that is, to an acceptable standard), then they were not washed at all. These statements contradict each other, so they cannot both be true at the same time. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first. Answer: no.",
