However, Statement 2 introduces a possibility that the muffins were not blueberry. This means that even if the cake was chocolate, it's possible that the muffins were not blueberry as stated in Statement 2.\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of this analysis on the question\n\nThe fact that the muffins might not have been blueberry does not provide enough information to infer that the cake was not chocolate. The statements only tell us that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are likely to be blueberry, but there's a possibility that they aren't.\n\nStep 4: Provide the final answer\n\nAnswer: No.",
