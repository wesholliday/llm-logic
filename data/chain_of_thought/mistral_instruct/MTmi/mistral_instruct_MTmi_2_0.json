However, Statement 2 states that the unicorn might not have been in the forest at all. This means that even though the presence of a griffin implies the presence of a unicorn according to Statement 1, it's possible for the unicorn not to be there based on Statement 2.\n\nStep 3: Determine if we can infer 'The griffin was not in the forest'\n\nNo, we cannot infer that 'The griffin was not in the forest' based on the given statements. The statements only tell us that the presence of a griffin implies the presence of a unicorn but does not guarantee it, and there is a possibility that the unicorn wasn't even in the forest.",
