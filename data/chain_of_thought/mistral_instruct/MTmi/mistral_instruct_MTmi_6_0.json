However, Statement 2 suggests that Bob's choice of pasta is not guaranteed.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possibility of Sue choosing pizza and Bob not choosing pasta\n\nIf Sue chose pizza, but Bob did not choose pasta, then both statements would be violated. This creates a contradiction.\n\nStep 4: Determine if it's possible for Sue to have chosen pizza given the information provided\n\nGiven the information provided, it is not possible for Sue to have chosen pizza because doing so would result in a contradiction with Statement 2.\n\nAnswer: no (Sue did not choose pizza).",
