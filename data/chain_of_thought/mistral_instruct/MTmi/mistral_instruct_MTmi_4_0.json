However, Statement 2 states that the robot might not have gone to Jupiter at all. This means that even if the alien visited Mars, it's possible that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nStep 3: Determine if we can infer 'The alien did not visit Mars' based on the given statements\n\nNo, we cannot infer 'The alien did not visit Mars' based on the given statements. The statements only tell us that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter, but they do not guarantee that the robot actually did visit Jupiter. Therefore, it is still possible for both the alien and the robot to have visited Mars without the robot visiting Jupiter. Answer: no.",
