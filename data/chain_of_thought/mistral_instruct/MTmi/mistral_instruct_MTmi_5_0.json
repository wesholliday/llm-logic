However, Statement 2 suggests that there is a possibility that Amy did not play tennis.\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of both statements together\n\nIf we assume that Jeff played basketball (making it true that Amy must have played tennis according to Statement 1), but then learn that Amy might not have played tennis (contradicting Statement 1), this creates a logical inconsistency. Therefore, our initial assumption that Jeff played basketball cannot be true.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: yes. The given statements do not allow us to infer that Jeff did not play basketball directly from Statement 2 alone. However, when we consider both statements together and analyze their implications, we can conclude that Jeff did not play basketball.",
