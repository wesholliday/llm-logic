            "content": " Step 1: Understand the given statements\n\nStatement 1: If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\nStatement 2: Jen might not have watched basketball.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given statements\n\nThe first statement implies that if Tom watches football, then Jen is guaranteed to watch basketball. However, Statement 2 suggests that it's possible for Jen not to have watched basketball at all.\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of both statements\n\nIf we assume Tom watched football (making Jen watch basketball according to Statement 1), but then consider Statement 2 which states \"Jen might not have watched basketball,\" we would be contradicting ourselves because we assumed Jen did watch basketball based on Statement 1.\n\nStep 4: Determine if 'Tom did not watch football' can be inferred\n\nSince the given statements do not allow us to infer that Tom definitely did not watch football, but rather create a contradiction when assuming he did, we cannot definitively say whether 'Tom did not watch football' can be inferred or not. Instead, let's focus on what can be inferred from Statement 2 alone: it does not allow us to conclude anything about Tom's actions.\n\nAnswer: No.",
