However, the second statement introduces a possibility that the cat was not outside. This means that even though the dog being inside implies the cat being outside, it's possible for both animals to be inside or outside in different scenarios.\n\nStep 3: Consider all possibilities\n\nWe cannot definitively say whether the dog is not inside based on the given statements alone because there are situations where both animals could be inside or outside. For instance, if they were in a room together, then neither of them would have been outside.\n\nAnswer: No.",
