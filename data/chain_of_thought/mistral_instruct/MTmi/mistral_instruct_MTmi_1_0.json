            "content": " Step 1: We have two statements.\n\nStatement 1: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\nStatement 2: Sue might not have been at the wedding.\n\nStep 2: Let's analyze each statement separately.\n\nStatement 1: This statement implies that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue also had to be present. It sets up a conditional relationship between Mary and Sue's attendance.\n\nStatement 2: This statement suggests that there is a possibility that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nStep 3: Now let's consider both statements together.\n\nIf Statement 1 is true, then Sue must have been at the wedding whenever Mary attended. However, Statement 2 states that Sue might not have been present. This creates a contradiction because we cannot have it both ways \u2013 either Sue is always present when Mary attends (as per Statement 1), or she might not be present at all (as per Statement 2).\n\nStep 4: To resolve this contradiction, let's examine the possibility of Mary not attending the wedding.\n\nIf Mary was not at the wedding, then there is no need to consider Sue's attendance since Statement 1 only applies when Mary is present. In this case, the contradiction disappears, and we don't have to infer anything about Sue's attendance one way or another.\n\nStep 5: Based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude 'Mary was not at the wedding'. However, we can say that from these statements alone, we cannot determine for certain if both Mary and Sue were at the wedding either.\n\nAnswer: No. (This answer is provided because the question asked if we can infer 'Mary was not at the wedding', but as discussed above, we cannot definitively make that conclusion based on the given information.)",
