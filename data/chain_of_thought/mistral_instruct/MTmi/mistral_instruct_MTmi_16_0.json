However, statement 2 introduces a possibility that the pants may not be denim. This means that even if the shirt is cotton, it's possible for the pants to be something other than denim. Therefore, the given statements do not allow us to infer that 'The shirt was not cotton'.\n\nStep 3: Provide the final answer.\n\nAnswer: no.",
