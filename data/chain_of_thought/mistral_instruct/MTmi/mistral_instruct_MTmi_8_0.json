However, the second statement introduces a possibility that the mummy was not awake. This means that even when the vampire is awake, there's a chance that the mummy isn't.\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of the given statements.\n\nThe fact that the mummy might not have been awake despite the vampire being awake contradicts the initial conditional statement. However, it does not definitively prove that the vampire was not awake. The two statements only suggest that the relationship between the vampire's and mummy's wakefulness is more complex than a simple cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nStep 4: Summarize your reasoning.\n\nThe given statements do not provide enough information to infer 'The vampire was not awake'. The relationship between the two entities' wakefulness is not straightforward, and there are possibilities for exceptions to the initial conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: no.",
