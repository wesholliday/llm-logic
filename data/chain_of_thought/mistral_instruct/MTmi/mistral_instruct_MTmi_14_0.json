This is a conditional statement with an 'if-then' relationship.\n\nStatement 2 states that the wolf might not have been in the den. This means it's possible for the wolf to be elsewhere or not present at all in the den.\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of both statements together\n\nThe given statements do not allow us to infer 'The bear was not in the cave'. The first statement only establishes a relationship between the presence of the bear and the potential presence of the wolf in the den. The second statement introduces the possibility that the wolf might not have been there at all. This does not negate the possibility of the bear being in the cave.\n\nAnswer: no.",
