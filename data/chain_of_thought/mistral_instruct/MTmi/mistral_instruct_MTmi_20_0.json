However, Statement 2 introduces a possibility that the banana was not yellow.\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of the given statements\n\nIf we assume that the apple is red, then according to Statement 1, the banana must be yellow. But Statement 2 states that the banana might not have been yellow. This means that even if the apple is red, it's possible for the banana to be something other than yellow. Therefore, the given statements do not allow us to infer that 'The apple was not red'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
