However, Statement 2 introduces a possibility that the truck was not blue. This means that the truck could have been another color.\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of both statements\n\nIf we assume that the car is red, then according to Statement 1, the truck must be blue. But Statement 2 tells us that the truck might not have been blue. Therefore, if the truck was not blue, then the car cannot be red based on Statement 1. However, Statement 2 does not definitively state that the truck was a specific color other than not being blue.\n\nStep 4: Determine the answer\n\nGiven the information provided, we cannot infer for certain that 'The car was not red'. The statements only allow us to conclude that if the truck was not blue, then the car cannot be red. However, Statement 2 does not definitively state that the truck was a specific color other than not being blue.\n\nAnswer: no.",
