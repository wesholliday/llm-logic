It does not provide any information about whether the doll actually is plastic or not.\n\nStatement 2: This statement is stating that the truck might not have been metal. It does not provide any information about the material of the doll.\n\nStep 3: Now let's consider if we can infer 'The doll was not plastic'.\n\nSince Statement 1 only tells us that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal, and Statement 2 does not contradict this statement, it does not provide enough information to infer that 'The doll was not plastic'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
