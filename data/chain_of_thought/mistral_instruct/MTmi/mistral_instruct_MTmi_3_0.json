            "content": " Step 1: We have two statements.\n\nStatement 1: If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\nStatement 2: The book might not be a mystery novel.\n\nStep 2: Let's analyze each statement separately.\n\nStatement 1: This is a conditional statement with an if-then structure. It states that if James wrote the book, then it must be a mystery novel.\n\nStatement 2: This statement introduces a possibility that the book might not be a mystery novel, regardless of who wrote it.\n\nStep 3: Now let's consider both statements together and try to infer 'The book was not written by James'.\n\nTo do this, we need to apply the principle of contradiction, which states that two opposing statements cannot both be true at the same time. In other words, if it is true that 'p' is not the case, then it must be true that 'not-p'.\n\nStep 4: Let's assume for a moment that 'The book was not written by James' is true (hypothesis). This would mean that someone else wrote the book.\n\nStep 5: If someone else wrote the book, then it could still be a mystery novel or it could be any other genre. The second statement does not contradict this possibility.\n\nStep 6: However, if we assume instead that 'The book was written by James' is true (negation of hypothesis), then according to Statement 1, the book must be a mystery novel.\n\nStep 7: But Statement 2 tells us that the book might not be a mystery novel, which contradicts Statement 1 when we assume that 'The book was written by James'.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, our initial assumption that 'The book was not written by James' is the only consistent explanation that does not lead to a contradiction.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
