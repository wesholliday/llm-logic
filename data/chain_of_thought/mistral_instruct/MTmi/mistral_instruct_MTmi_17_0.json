However, Statement 2 states that it's possible for Kate to not eat salad. This creates a conflict because both statements cannot be true at the same time.\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of each statement being true\n\nIf Statement 1 is true, then whenever Ben eats pasta, Kate must eat salad. But if Statement 2 is also true, there are instances where Kate didn't eat salad despite Ben having eaten pasta. This contradiction means that at least one of the statements is false.\n\nStep 4: Determine which statement is likely to be false based on available information\n\nSince we don't have enough information to definitively say whether Statement 1 or Statement 2 is false, let's consider their implications. A false 'if...then...' statement usually results in an incorrect conclusion about the cause-effect relationship between two events. In this case, if Statement 1 were false, it would mean that Ben could eat pasta without Kate eating salad - a situation not explicitly ruled out by the given information. However, if Statement 2 were false, it would mean that Kate always eats salad when Ben eats pasta, which is directly contradicted by the given information.\n\nStep 5: Conclude based on the analysis\n\nGiven the above reasoning, it's more likely that Statement 1 ('If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad') is false. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes (Ben did not eat pasta could be inferred from the given statements).",
