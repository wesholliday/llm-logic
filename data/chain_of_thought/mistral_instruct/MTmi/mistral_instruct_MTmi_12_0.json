However, Statement 2 suggests that Lucy might not have gone to the zoo at all. This creates a conflict because both statements cannot be true at the same time.\n\nStep 3: Consider possible scenarios\n\nScenario A: Joe went to the park and Lucy went to the zoo. In this case, both statements are true.\n\nScenario B: Joe went to the park but Lucy did not go to the zoo. In this scenario, Statement 1 is false because Lucy did not go to the zoo, while Statement 2 is true because it does not state that Lucy had to go to the zoo.\n\nStep 4: Determine the answer based on the given information\n\nSince we cannot definitively determine which scenario is correct with the given information, we cannot infer 'Joe did not go to the park' from the statements provided.\n\nAnswer: no.",
