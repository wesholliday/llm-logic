However, Statement 2 suggests that Mark's action of buying the blue shirt is not a certainty.\n\nStep 3: Consider possible scenarios\n\nScenario 1: Lisa bought the red shirt, but Mark did not buy the blue shirt (in violation of Statement 1).\nScenario 2: Lisa did not buy the red shirt, and Mark also did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nStep 4: Determine if 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt' can be inferred from the given statements\n\nSince both scenarios are possible without violating any of the given statements, we cannot infer that 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\n\nAnswer: no.",
