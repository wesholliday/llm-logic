Now, according to the conditional statement, if the alien visits Mars, then the robot visits Jupiter. This means that if the condition (alien visiting Mars) is true, then the consequence (robot visiting Jupiter) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
