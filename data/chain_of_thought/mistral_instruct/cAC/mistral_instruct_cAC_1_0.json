The first statement, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" is a conditional statement that can be read as \"If Mary attended the wedding, then Sue also attended.\" The second statement, \"Sue was at the wedding,\" tells us that Sue did indeed attend the wedding. Since we know that if Mary attended, then Sue attended, and we know that Sue did attend, it logically follows that Mary must have attended as well.",
