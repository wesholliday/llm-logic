In this case, if the car is red, then the truck is blue.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the truck is indeed blue.\n\nStep 3: Apply logical reasoning\n\nTo determine if we can conclude that the car is red based on these given statements, we need to consider both statements together and apply the rules of logic.\n\nFirst, let's examine the conditional statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This statement sets up a relationship between two conditions: if the car is red, then the truck is blue.\n\nNow, we know that the second condition (the truck being blue) is true based on Statement 2. However, this does not necessarily mean that the first condition (the car being red) is also true. The truth of one condition does not automatically imply the truth of the other condition in a conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot directly conclude that \"The car was red\" based on the given statements alone.\n\nStep 4: Provide the final answer\n\nAnswer: no.",
