We have two conditional statements:\n   a) If p (the book was written by James), then q (the book is a mystery novel).\n   b) Q (the book is a mystery novel).\n\n2. To determine if we can conclude p (the book was written by James), we need to apply the rule of Modus Ponens, which states that if we have two conditional statements:\n   a) If p then q\n   b) q\n   Then we can conclude p.\n\n3. In our case, we have statement a) as given and statement b) from the information provided. So, we can apply Modus Ponens to conclude that \"The book was written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: yes.",
