This is a conditional statement with an 'if-then' relationship. It does not directly tell us what the doll actually is made of.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the truck is metal.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possibilities\n\nFrom Statement 2, we know that the truck is metal. However, Statement 1 does not allow us to conclude anything about the doll being plastic based on the given information alone. The statement only establishes a relationship between the doll being plastic and the truck being metal. It doesn't guarantee that the doll is plastic if the truck is metal or vice versa.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\n\nAnswer: No. We cannot conclude that 'The doll was plastic' based on the given statements alone.",
