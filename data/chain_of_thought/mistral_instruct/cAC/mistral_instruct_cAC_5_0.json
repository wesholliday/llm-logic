We have two conditional statements: If p (Jeff plays basketball), then q (Amy plays tennis); and q is true (Amy played tennis).\n2. To apply the rule of Modus Ponens, we need to ensure that p is true or that we have sufficient evidence to assume it's true based on the given information.\n3. We don't have any direct evidence that Jeff played basketball; all we know is that if he did, then Amy would have played tennis, and Amy did play tennis.\n4. Since we cannot make assumptions beyond what is given in the problem statement, we cannot conclude that \"Jeff played basketball\" based on the provided information.\n\nAnswer: no.",
