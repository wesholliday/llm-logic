We have two statements: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" and \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement, meaning it sets up a relationship between two events: If event A (Sue chooses pizza), then event B (Bob chooses pasta) occurs.\n3. The second statement tells us that event B (Bob chose pasta) has indeed occurred.\n4. However, the first statement does not guarantee that event A (Sue chose pizza) must have also occurred; it only states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob would choose pasta.\n5. Therefore, even though we know Bob chose pasta, we cannot be certain that Sue chose pizza based on the given information alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
