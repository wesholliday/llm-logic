If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. (Conditional statement)\n2. The wolf was in the den.\n\nFirst, we need to understand that a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is true only when both P and Q are true or when P is false. In our case, we have been given that Q (the wolf was in the den) is true, but we don't know if P (the bear was in the cave) is true or false.\n\nSince we cannot be certain that P (the bear was in the cave) is true based on the given information, we cannot conclude 'Answer: yes' that the bear was in the cave. Instead, our conclusion should be 'Answer: no'.",
