It tells us that there are only two possibilities for the cat's location and behavior.\n\nStep 3: Now let's consider Statement 2. It states that the cat is not playing in the bedroom. This means that the first possibility in Statement 1 (the cat playing in the bedroom) is false.\n\nStep 4: Since Statement 1 tells us that there are only two possibilities for the cat, and one of them has been proven false, it follows that the other possibility must be true.\n\nStep 5: The second possibility in Statement 1 is 'the cat is napping on the couch'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
