We start with the given information that \"Either the notebook is sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer.\" This means that the notebook could be in one of two places: either on the nightstand or in the drawer.\n2. The next piece of information given is \"The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand.\" This tells us that the notebook is not in the first possible location mentioned earlier, which is on the nightstand.\n3. Since we know that the notebook cannot be on the nightstand, and we also know that it can only be in one of two places (either on the nightstand or in the drawer), then the only remaining possibility is that the notebook must be in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The notebook is in the drawer'.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
