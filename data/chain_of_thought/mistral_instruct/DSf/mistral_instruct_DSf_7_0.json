We have two statements: \"Either the umbrella is tucked away in the closet or it is in the car\" and \"The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet.\"\n2. The first statement tells us that the umbrella can only be in one of two places: either in the closet or in the car.\n3. The second statement tells us that the umbrella is not in the closet.\n4. Since we know that the umbrella cannot be in both the closet and the car at the same time, and it's not in the closet, then the only remaining possibility is that it must be in the car.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The umbrella is in the car'.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
