It tells us that Fido can be either in the garden or inside, but it doesn't exclude the possibility of him being inside.\n\nStep 3: Now let's consider Statement 2. It states that Fido is not in the garden.\n\nStep 4: Since Statement 2 contradicts Statement 1 (Fido cannot be both in the garden and not in the garden at the same time), we need to find a resolution.\n\nStep 5: Given that Statement 2 excludes the possibility of Fido being in the garden, it follows that Fido must be inside according to Statement 1.\n\nAnswer: yes",
