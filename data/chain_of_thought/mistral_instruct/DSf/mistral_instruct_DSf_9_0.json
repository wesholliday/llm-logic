Statement 1: Either the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\n2. Statement 2: The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor.\n\nNow let's analyze these statements:\n\nIf the missing puzzle piece was on the floor and blending in, then Statement 2 would not be true because it states that the missing piece is not blending in on the floor. Therefore, if Statement 2 is true, then the missing puzzle piece cannot be on the floor and blending in.\n\nSince Statement 2 is true, the only remaining option for the missing puzzle piece is that it must be in the box (as stated in Statement 1).\n\nAnswer: yes.",
