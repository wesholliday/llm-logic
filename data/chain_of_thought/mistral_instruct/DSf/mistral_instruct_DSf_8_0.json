It states that the remote control could be either under the couch or on the coffee table. This means that there are two possible locations for the remote control according to this statement.\n\nStep 3: Now let's consider Statement 2. It states that the remote control isn't hiding under the couch. This means that the remote control cannot be in one of the two possible locations mentioned in Statement 1, which is under the couch.\n\nStep 4: Since the remote control can no longer be under the couch (Statement 2), it must then be in the other possible location mentioned in Statement 1, which is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
