Either the grommet is sploffed or it is plopped.\n\nStep 2: Analyze each statement individually\n\nStatement 1: The grommet is not plopped. This means that the grommet has not been placed in a certain way, possibly with a forceful impact, resulting in a 'plop' sound.\n\nStatement 2: Either the grommet is sploffed or it is plopped. This statement suggests that there are only two possibilities for the state of the grommet - either it has been 'sploffed' (exploded or ejected forcefully) or 'plopped' (placed with a forceful impact).\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of both statements together\n\nSince Statement 1 tells us that the grommet is not plopped, it follows that the grommet cannot be both not-plopped and plopped at the same time. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the grommet must have been sploffed.\n\nStep 4: Final answer\n\nAnswer: yes. The given statements allow us to infer that 'The grommet is sploffed'.",
