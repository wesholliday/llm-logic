This means that the condition of being zimmed is not met for the flug.\n\nStatement 2 presents two possibilities: either the flug is blummed or it is zimmed. Since we know from Statement 1 that the flug is not zimmed, this leaves us with the possibility that the flug might be blummed according to Statement 2.\n\nStep 3: Consider both possibilities in light of given information\n\nSince Statement 1 states that the flug is not zimmed and Statement 2 presents two possibilities, one of which (being zimmed) we know does not apply to the flug, the remaining possibility must be true for the flug. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes, the flug is blummed.",
