Statement 2, on the other hand, gives us two possibilities for the state of the twonk: it can be varnished or plinked.\n\nStep 3: Eliminate contradictory options\n\nSince we know from Statement 1 that the twonk is not plinked, this means that the second alternative in Statement 2 (the twonk being plinked) cannot be true. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the twonk is varnished.\n\nStep 4: Provide the answer\n\nAnswer: yes. The given statements allow us to infer that 'The twonk is varnished'.",
