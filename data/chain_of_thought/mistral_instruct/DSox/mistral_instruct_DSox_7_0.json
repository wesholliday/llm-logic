However, the second statement 'Either the whiffle is shanked or it is tinked' suggests that these are the only two possibilities for what could have happened to the ball.\n\nStep 3: Consider all possible scenarios\n\nIf 'The whiffle is not tinked', then it was not hit squarely, which means it could have been shanked (hit a side spin). However, we also know that if it was shanked, then it would be included in the category of 'either being shanked or tinked'. Therefore, based on the given information, it is possible that 'The whiffle is shanked'.\n\nStep 4: Provide final answer\n\nAnswer: yes.",
