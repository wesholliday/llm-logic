The second statement can be broken down into two separate statements: \"The wug is not bimmed\" (which we already know) and \"The wug is flooped\".\n3. Since both statements cannot be true at the same time, if one is true, then the other must be false.\n4. We already know that \"The wug is not bimmed\", so by process of elimination, \"The wug is flooped\" must be false.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The wug is flooped' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no.",
