This means that the flob is in a stationary position and has not been disturbed.\n\nStatement 2 presents two alternatives for the state of the flob: either it is skizzled or it is movated. Skizzled is not defined in this context, so we cannot assume what it means without further information. Movated can be interpreted as being moved or motivated.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possibilities based on the given statements\n\nSince Statement 1 states that the flob is not moved, it contradicts the alternative \"it is movated\" in Statement 2. However, we cannot infer that the flob is skizzled based on the given information alone because there is no evidence to support this claim.\n\nStep 4: Conclude and answer the question\n\nAnswer: No. We cannot infer 'The flob is skizzled' from 'The flob is not movated' and 'Either the flob is skizzled or it is movated'.",
