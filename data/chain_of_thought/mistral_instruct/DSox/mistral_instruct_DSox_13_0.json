This means that no one has stepped on or crushed the glip.\n\nStatement 2 presents two possibilities: either the glip is slogged (whatever that means) or it is trampled. Since we know that it's not trampled, let's consider the second possibility.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate if Statement 2 provides new information\n\nThe statement \"Either the glip is slogged or it is trampled\" does not provide any new information about the current state of the glip. We already know that it's not trampled, so the second part of the statement (it being slogged) cannot be true if the first part (it's not trampled) is known to be true.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\n\nSince Statement 2 does not provide any new information and its second part contradicts the known fact from Statement 1, we cannot infer that \"The glip is slogged.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
