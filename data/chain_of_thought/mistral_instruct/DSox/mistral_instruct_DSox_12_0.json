This means that the smip does not have the property 'lupped'.\n\nStatement 2 states that either the smip is shripped or it is lupped. This means that the smip has one of these two properties, but we don't know which one.\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of both statements together\n\nSince Statement 1 tells us that the smip is not lupped, and Statement 2 tells us that the smip has one of the two properties (shripped or lupped), it follows that the smip must have the property 'shripped'. This is because if the smip were not shripped as well, then both statements would be contradicting each other.\n\nStep 4: Write the answer\n\nAnswer: yes",
