We have two conditional statements: If p (the smonk was vreebled), then q (the smonk plagged). Not p (the smonk was not vreebled).\n2. To determine if we can infer not-q (the smonk was not plagged) from these two statements, we need to consider the relationship between p and q in each conditional statement.\n3. In the first conditional statement \"If p then q,\" p is the hypothesis or premise, and q is the conclusion. This statement implies that whenever p is true, q must also be true.\n4. In the second conditional statement \"Not p,\" it negates the hypothesis or premise (p) but does not necessarily negate the conclusion (q).\n5. To understand this relationship better, let's consider a truth table for these two statements:\n\n| p | q  | If p then q | Not p |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| T | T  |   T         | F    |\n| T | F  |   F         | F    |\n| F | T  |   T         | T    |\n| F | F  |   T         | T    |\n\n6. From the truth table, we can see that when p is false (the smonk was not vreebled), q can still be either true or false (the smonk could have been plagged or not).\n7. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer \"The smonk was not plagged\" from \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged\" and \"The smonk was not vreebled.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
