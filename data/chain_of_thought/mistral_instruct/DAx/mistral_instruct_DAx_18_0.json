However, we are also told that the shank was not plooked. This information alone does not allow us to infer that the shank was not nugged because the conditional statement only establishes a relationship between plooking and nugging, but it doesn't necessarily mean that both must occur together.\n\nStep 3: Consider possible scenarios.\n\nThere could be several possible scenarios based on the given information:\n\n1. The shank was not plooked and therefore was not nugged (this is a valid scenario)\n2. The shank was not plooked but was still nugged (this is also a possible scenario, as the conditional statement does not guarantee that both must occur together)\n3. The shank was plooked but was not nugged (this is not a valid scenario, as the given information states that if the shank was plooked, then it was nugged)\n\nStep 4: Make a conclusion based on the available information.\n\nBased on the available information, we cannot infer that 'The shank was not nugged'. The conditional statement only establishes a relationship between plooking and nugging, but it does not guarantee that both must occur together whenever one occurs. Therefore, the absence of plooking does not necessarily mean the absence of nugging.\n\nAnswer: no.",
