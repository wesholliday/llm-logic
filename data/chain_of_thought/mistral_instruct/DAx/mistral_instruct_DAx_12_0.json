We have two conditional statements: If P (the smip was shripped) then Q (the smip lupped the zoint), and Not P (the smip was not shripped).\n2. To determine if we can infer Not Q (the smip did not lup the zoint) from these two statements, we need to consider the relationship between P, Q, and Not P.\n3. The first conditional statement \"If P then Q\" tells us that whenever P is true, Q must also be true.\n4. The second statement \"Not P\" tells us that P is false.\n5. Since P is false, according to the first conditional statement, Q must also be false.\n6. Therefore, we can infer Not Q (the smip did not lup the zoint) from \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint\" and \"The smip was not shripped.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
