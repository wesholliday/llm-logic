We have two conditional statements: If P (wug was flooped), then Q (wug bimmed the zoint). Not P (wug was not flooped).\n2. To find out if we can infer Not Q (wug did not bim the zoint) from these given statements, we need to apply the rules of logic for conditional statements:\n   a. If P implies Q and Not P is true, then Q cannot be true at the same time as P is false. This is known as the Law of Contradiction or the Principle of Non-Contradiction.\n3. In our case, if \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint\" implies that \"The wug bimmed the zoint\" when \"the wug was flooped,\" and we know that \"The wug was not flooped,\" then it follows that \"The wug did not bim the zoint.\"\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The wug did not bim the zoint.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
