The splat was not morphed.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot directly infer that 'The splat did not quank'. Here's why:\n\nThe first statement tells us that if the splat was morphed, then it quanked. However, this statement does not tell us what happens when the splat is not morphed. It could be that only morphed splats quank, or it could be that all splats quank regardless of whether they are morphed or not. Without further information, we cannot determine if a non-morphed splat quanks or not.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: no.",
