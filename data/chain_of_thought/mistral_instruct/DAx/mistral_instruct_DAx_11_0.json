We have two conditional statements: If p (the flug was blummed), then q (the flug was zimmed).\n2. Not p (the flug was not blummed).\n3. To determine if we can infer not q (the flug was not zimmed) from these two statements, we need to consider the relationship between p and q in the given conditional statements.\n4. The first statement tells us that if p is true, then q must be true. In other words, blumming implies zimming.\n5. The second statement tells us that p is false, or the flug was not blummed.\n6. However, we cannot directly infer that q (zimming) is also false based on these two statements alone because the conditional statement only establishes a relationship between p and q when p is true.\n7. Therefore, even though we know that the flug was not blummed, we cannot infer for certain that it was not zimmed based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no.",
