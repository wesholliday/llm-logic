We have two conditional statements: If p (the clug was fleeked), then q (the clug snugged).\n2. Not p (the clug was not fleeked).\n3. To determine if we can infer not q (the clug was not snugged) from these statements, we need to consider the relationship between p and q in the first conditional statement.\n4. The first conditional statement \"If p, then q\" means that whenever p is true, q must also be true. It does not necessarily mean that q is always true; it only means that if p is true, then q must be true as well.\n5. Since we know that not p (the clug was not fleeked), we cannot infer for certain that not q (the clug was not snugged) is also true based on the given information alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
