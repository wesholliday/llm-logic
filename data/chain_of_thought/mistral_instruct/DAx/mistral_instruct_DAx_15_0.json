We have two conditional statements: If p (the dreb was vroombed), then q (the dreb was spened).\n2. Not p (the dreb was not vroombed).\n3. To determine if we can infer not q (the dreb was not spened) from these statements, we need to consider the relationship between p and q in the first conditional statement.\n4. The first conditional statement \"If p, then q\" is a material conditional. This means that it is true unless p is false and q is true together.\n5. Since not p (the dreb was not vroombed), we don't know for sure if not q (the dreb was not spened) is also true or not.\n6. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The dreb was not spened\" with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no.",
