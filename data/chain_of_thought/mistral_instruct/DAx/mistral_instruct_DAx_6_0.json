'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink': This statement is a conditional statement, meaning that if the condition (grommet being sploffed) is true, then the consequence (grommet plopping the frink) is also true.\n2. 'The grommet was not sploffed': This statement negates the condition in the first statement, implying that the grommet was not sploffed and therefore did not undergo the condition stated in the first conditional.\n3. To infer 'The grommet did not plop the frink' from these two statements, we need to consider if the consequence (grommet plopping the frink) is negated by the given information.\n4. Since the condition (grommet being sploffed) is negated in the second statement, it follows that the consequence (grommet plopping the frink) is also negated because of the 'if-then' relationship in the first statement.\n5. Therefore, we can infer 'The grommet did not plop the frink'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
