We have two statements: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" and \"The wug was not sproinged.\"\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement, meaning it describes a relationship between two events or propositions. In this case, if the wug is sproinged, then it is garpled.\n3. The second statement tells us that the wug was not sproinged.\n4. To determine if we can infer \"The wug was not garpled\" from these two statements, let's consider what would happen if the wug were both sproinged and garpled at the same time:\n   a. According to the first statement, if the wug is sproinged, then it must be garpled.\n   b. However, according to the second statement, the wug was not sproinged.\n5. Since the wug was not sproinged, it follows that it could not have been both sproinged and garpled at the same time. Therefore, if the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled as well.\n6.
