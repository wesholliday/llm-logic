We have two conditional statements: If p (the sprocket was cranked) then q (the sprocket was daggled), and not p (the sprocket was not cranked).\n2. To determine if we can infer not-q (the sprocket was not daggled) from not-p (the sprocket was not cranked), we need to consider the relationship between p, q, and not-p, not-q.\n3. The first conditional statement \"If p then q\" implies that whenever p is true, q must also be true. However, it does not necessarily mean that when p is false (not-p), q must be false as well. It only guarantees that if p is true, then q is true.\n4. In our case, we know that not-p is true (the sprocket was not cranked). To infer not-q (the sprocket was not daggled) from not-p, we would need to prove that the converse of the original conditional statement \"If p then q\" is also true: If not-q then not-p.\n5. Unfortunately, without further information, we cannot definitively say whether or not the converse is true. It's possible that when the sprocket is not daggled (not-q), it might still be cranked (p) or not cranked (not-p).\n6. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The sprocket was not daggled\" from \"The sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
