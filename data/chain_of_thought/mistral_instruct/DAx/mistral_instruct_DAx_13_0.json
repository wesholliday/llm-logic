We have two conditional statements: If p (the glip was slogged), then q (the glip was tragged). Not p (the glip was not slogged).\n2. To determine if we can infer not-q (the glip was not tragged) from not-p, we need to consider the relationship between p and q in the original conditional statement.\n3. In this case, the first conditional statement \"If p, then q\" indicates that whenever p is true, q must also be true. This is known as a material implication or a biconditional statement if p and q are equivalent.\n4. Since we know that not-p (the glip was not slogged), but we don't have any information about the truth value of q (whether the glip was tragged or not), we cannot directly infer not-q based on the given information alone.\n5. Therefore, the answer is 'Answer: no'.",
