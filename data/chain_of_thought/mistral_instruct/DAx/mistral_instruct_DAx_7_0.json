We know that \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\" This statement establishes a conditional relationship between two events - if the whiffle is shanked (hit poorly), then it makes a tinking sound.\n2. The second statement is \"The whiffle was not shanked.\" This means that the whiffle was hit well, according to the given information.\n3. However, just because the whiffle was hit well does not necessarily mean it did not make a tinkling sound. The conditional statement only tells us that if it is shanked, it makes a tinkling sound. It doesn't say anything about what happens when it's not shanked.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer for certain that \"The whiffle did not tink.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
