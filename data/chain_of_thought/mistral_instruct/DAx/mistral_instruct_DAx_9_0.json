We have two conditional statements: If p (plinked) then q (varnished), and not p (not plinked).\n2. To determine if we can infer not q (not varnished) from these statements, we need to apply the rules of logical implication.\n3. The first rule is that a conditional statement \"If p then q\" is equivalent to \"not p or q.\" This means that for the condition \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished\" to be true, either the twonk wasn't plinked (not p), or it was varnished (q).\n4. We have been given that not p is true (The twonk was not plinked).\n5. Therefore, based on the rules of logical implication, we cannot infer that not q (The twonk was not varnished) from \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished\" and \"The twonk was not plinked.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
