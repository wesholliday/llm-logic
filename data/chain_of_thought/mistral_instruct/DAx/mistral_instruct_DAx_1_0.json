We have two conditional statements: If p (the flugel was blimmed), then q (the flugel was zargled). Not p (the flugel was not blimmed).\n2. To determine if we can infer not-q (the flugel was not zargled) from not-p, we need to consider the relationship between p and q in the given conditional statements.\n3. The first statement \"If p, then q\" is a material conditional, meaning it describes the necessary relationship between p and q but does not guarantee that p always causes q or that they are related in every way.\n4. In this case, we have been given that not-p (the flugel was not blimmed) holds true. However, we cannot directly infer not-q (the flugel was not zargled) from not-p based on the given information alone.\n5. The conditional statement \"If p, then q\" only tells us that if the flugel is blimmed, it will be zargled; it does not guarantee that every time the flugel is not blimmed, it will also not be zargled.\n6. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The flugel was not zargled' from 'The flugel was not blimmed' based on the given information alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
