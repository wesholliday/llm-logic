We have two conditional statements: If P (the fleeg was bluttered), then Q (it surned). Not P (the fleeg was not bluttered).\n2. To find out if we can infer Not Q (the fleeg did not surn) from these given statements, we need to apply the rules of logic for conditional statements:\n   a. If P implies Q and Not P is true, then Q cannot be true at the same time as Not P. This is known as the law of contradiction or the principle of non-contradiction.\n3. In our case, we have \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" (P implies Q) and \"The fleeg was not bluttered\" (Not P). Since Not P is true and P implies Q, it follows that Q cannot be true at the same time as Not P.\n4. Therefore, we can infer \"The fleeg did not surn.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
