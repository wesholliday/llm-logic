We have two conditional statements: If p (zinger was fraggled) then q (zinger was smoogled), and not p (zinger was not fraggled).\n2. To determine if we can infer not-q (zinger was not smoogled) from not-p, we need to consider the relationship between p, q, and not-p, not-q.\n3. The given statements do not provide enough information to definitively say that not-p implies not-q. In fact, it's possible for both p and q to be false (the zinger neither was fraggled nor smoogled), or for p to be true but q to be false (the zinger was fraggled but not smoogled).\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The zinger was not smoogled\" from \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\" and \"The zinger was not fraggled.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
