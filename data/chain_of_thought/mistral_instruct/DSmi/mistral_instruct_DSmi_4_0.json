It does not provide any information about which one is true.\n\nStatement 2: This statement introduces a possibility that contradicts Statement 1, suggesting that the cat might not be in the bedroom at all.\n\nStep 3: Consider how these statements relate to each other.\n\nSince Statement 2 contradicts Statement 1's assumption about the cat being in the bedroom, it is possible that the cat is indeed napping on the couch instead. However, we cannot definitively conclude this based on the given information alone.\n\nStep 4: Determine if a conclusion can be drawn.\n\nAnswer: No. While it's possible that the cat is napping on the couch, there isn't enough information to confirm this for certain.",
