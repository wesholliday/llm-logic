It states that the pen can only be in one of two places - either in the bag or on the desk.\n\nStep 3: Now let's consider Statement 2. It states that the pen might not be on the desk, which means it could also be somewhere else, like in the bag.\n\nStep 4: However, Statement 1 does not allow for any other possibilities besides the pen being in the bag or on the desk. Since Statement 2 does not contradict Statement 1 (the pen could still be in the bag), we cannot infer that the pen is definitely on the desk based on these statements alone.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, we cannot definitively answer whether the pen is in the bag or on the desk based on the given information. We can only say that it's possible for the pen to be in the bag according to Statement 1 and Statement 2 does not contradict this possibility.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The pen is in my bag' with certainty from the given statements. However, we can infer that it's a possibility based on Statement 1.",
