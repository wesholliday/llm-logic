This means that only one of the two conditions can be true at a time.\n\nStep 3: The second statement, \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet,\" introduces a possibility that neither condition in the first statement may be true.\n\nStep 4: However, this second statement does not provide enough information to definitively determine which of the two conditions in the first statement is true or false. It only tells us that one of them might not be true.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The jacket is draped over the chair'.\n\nAnswer: no.",
