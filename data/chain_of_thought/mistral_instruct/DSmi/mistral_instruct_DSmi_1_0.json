We want to know if we can infer that \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nStep 2: Let's analyze each statement:\n\nStatement 1: This statement tells us that Fido cannot be neither inside nor outside, but must be in one of those two places.\n\nStatement 2: This statement informs us that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden.\n\nStep 3: Now let's consider if we can infer \"Fido is inside\" based on these statements:\n\nSince Statement 1 tells us that Fido must be either inside or in the garden, and Statement 2 informs us that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, it does not necessarily mean that Fido is inside. In fact, it could also mean that Fido is neither inside nor in the garden (for example, he might be somewhere else entirely). Therefore, we cannot infer \"Fido is inside\" based on these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
