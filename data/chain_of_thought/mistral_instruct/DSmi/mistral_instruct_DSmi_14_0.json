This is a disjunction (or).\n\nStatement 2 states that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge, which means it could also be on the counter. However, Statement 2 does not exclude the possibility that the milk is in the fridge.\n\nStep 3: Now let's consider if we can infer 'The milk is on the counter'.\n\nSince Statement 1 states that the milk can only be on the counter or in the fridge, and Statement 2 does not exclude the possibility of the milk being on the counter, we cannot definitively conclude that 'The milk is on the counter'. However, we also cannot definitively conclude that 'The milk is in the fridge' based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: no. We cannot infer 'The milk is on the counter' with certainty based on the given statements.",
