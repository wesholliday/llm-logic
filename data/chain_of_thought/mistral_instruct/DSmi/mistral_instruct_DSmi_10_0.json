It does not exclude the possibility that the sock could be in some other location.\n\nStatement 2: This statement introduces a new possibility that the missing sock might not be under the bed at all.\n\nStep 3: Now let's consider both statements together.\n\nSince Statement 1 only suggests that the missing sock is either in the laundry basket or under the bed, and Statement 2 introduces a new possibility that it might not be under the bed, we cannot infer that the missing sock is definitely in the laundry basket based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
