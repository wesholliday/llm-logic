Since Statement 1 tells us that there are only two possibilities for the location of the scarf and Statement 2 informs us that one of those possibilities might not be true, it follows logically that the other possibility must be true. Therefore, if the scarf is not draped on the coat rack (as per Statement 2), then it must be stuffed in the backpack (as per Statement 1).\n\nAnswer: yes.",
