It does not exclude the possibility of the notebook being in some other location.\n\nStatement 2: This statement informs us that the notebook might not be on the nightstand, but it does not necessarily mean that the notebook is in the drawer. The notebook could be in some other location entirely.\n\nStep 3: Now let's consider both statements together.\n\nSince Statement 1 only tells us that the notebook can be in one of two places (drawer or nightstand), and Statement 2 informs us that it might not be on the nightstand, we cannot definitively conclude that the notebook is in the drawer based on these two statements alone. There could be other possible locations for the notebook as well.\n\nAnswer: No.",
