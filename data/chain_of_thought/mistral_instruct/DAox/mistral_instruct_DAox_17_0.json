The meaning of 'skizzled' is unknown without additional context.\n\nStatement 2 is a conditional statement, which states that if the flob was skizzled, then it moved. This implies that moving is a consequence of being skizzled.\n\nStep 3: Consider the relationship between the statements\n\nSince Statement 1 states that the flob was not skizzled, and Statement 2 states that if the flob was skizzled, then it moved, we cannot directly infer that the flob did not move based on these two statements alone. The fact that the flob didn't move when it wasn't skizzled is not explicitly stated in the given information.\n\nAnswer: no.",
