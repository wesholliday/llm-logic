We have two given statements: a) The flugel was not blimmed\nb) If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled\n\n2. To infer \"The flugel was not zargled\" from these statements, we need to apply the principle of contrapositive in logic:\n   a) If p (flugel was blimmed) implies q (flugel was zargled), then the negation of q (not flugel was zargled) implies the negation of p (not flugel was blimmed).\n\n3. Let's check if our given statements follow this pattern:\n   a) We have \"p\" as \"The flugel was blimmed.\"\n   b) And we have \"q\" as \"The flugel was zargled.\"\n\n4. To apply the contrapositive, we need to negate both \"p\" and \"q\":\n   a) Not p: The flugel was not blimmed.\n   b) Not q: The flugel was not zargled.\n\n5. Now let's check if our given statements follow the implication pattern of contrapositive:\n   a) If p (flugel was blimmed) implies q (flugel was zargled), then not q (not flugel was zargled) implies not p (not flugel was blimmed).\n\n6. Let's analyze the given statements in terms of this pattern:\n   a) We have \"p\" as \"The flugel was blimmed.\"\n   b) And we have \"q\" as \"The flugel was zargled.\"\n   c) Our first statement is \"not p\": The flugel was not blimmed.\n   d) Our second statement is \"if p, then q\": If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\n\n7. To check if our given statements follow the implication pattern of contrapositive, we need to see if \"not q\" (The flugel was not zargled) implies \"not p\" (The flugel was not blimmed):\n   a) If The flugel was not zargled (not q), then The flugel was not blimmed (not p).\n   b) Since our given statements do not provide any information about the relationship between \"not zargled\" and \"not blimmed,\" we cannot directly infer that from them.\n\nAnswer: No.",
