We have two given statements: a) The flug was not blummed\nb) If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed\n\n2. To infer \"The flug was not zimmed\" from these statements, we would need to use the principle of contrapositive in logic. The contrapositive of statement b) is: \"If the flug was not zimmed, then it was not blummed.\"\n\n3. However, we don't have this statement given. We only have the original statements a) and b).\n\n4. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer \"The flug was not zimmed\" with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no.",
