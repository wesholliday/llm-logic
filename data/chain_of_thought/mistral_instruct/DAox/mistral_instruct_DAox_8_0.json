The first statement is \"The sprocket was not cranked.\"\n2. The second statement is \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\"\n3. This second statement is a conditional statement, which means it describes a relationship between two events: if event A (sprocket being cranked) occurs, then event B (sprocket being daggled) also occurs.\n4. However, the first statement tells us that event A did not occur (the sprocket was not cranked).\n5. Since event A did not occur, we cannot infer that event B occurred based on the given information alone.\n6. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The sprocket was not daggled\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no.",
