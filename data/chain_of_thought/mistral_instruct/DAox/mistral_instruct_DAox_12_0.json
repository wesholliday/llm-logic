We cannot directly infer \"The smip did not lup the zoint\" from \"The smip was not shripped.\" The two statements are independent of each other.\n2. However, if we add the conditional statement into the equation, we can use it to make an inference: Since \"The smip was not shripped,\" the first part of the conditional statement is false. Therefore, according to the rule of contrapositive, if the first part is false, then the second part must also be false. So, \"The smip did not lup the zoint\" is a valid conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
