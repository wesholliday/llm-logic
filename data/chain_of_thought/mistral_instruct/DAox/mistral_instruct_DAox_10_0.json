We have two conditional statements:\n   a) If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled (If P, then Q)\n   b) The wug was not sproinged (Not P)\n\n2. To find out if we can infer \"The wug was not garpled\" (Not Q), we need to apply the rules of logical implication:\n\n   a) If P implies Q, and Not P is true, then it cannot be inferred that Q is true, but it also cannot be inferred that Q is false. In other words, the given information is not sufficient to determine the truth value of Q.\n\n3. Therefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer \"The wug was not garpled\" with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no.",
