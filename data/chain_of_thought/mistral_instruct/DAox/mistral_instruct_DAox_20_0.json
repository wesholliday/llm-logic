The fleeg was not bluttered. This means that the fleeg was not wet or dirty with something, possibly mud or water.\n2. If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned. This is a conditional statement, meaning if the condition (the fleeg being bluttered) is true, then the consequence (it surning) must also be true. Surning could mean anything in this context, but for the sake of argument, let's assume it means that the fleeg makes a certain noise or behaves in a specific way when wet.\n\nNow, to infer \"The fleeg did not surn,\" we would need to have enough information to conclude that if the fleeg was not bluttered, then it definitely did not surn. However, we only know that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned. We don't have any information about what happens when the fleeg is not bluttered and dry. Therefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer \"The fleeg did not surn.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
