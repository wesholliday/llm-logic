The grommet did not sploff: This means that the grommet did not explode or come apart suddenly.\n2. If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink: This is a conditional statement, meaning it describes a relationship between two events. It states that if the grommet had exploded (sploffed), then the frink would have been dropped (plopped) by the grommet.\n\nNow let's consider the inference we want to make: \"The grommet did not plop the frink.\"\n\nTo infer this from the given statements, we need to prove that the grommet could not have both not sploffed and plopped the frink at the same time. However, since the conditional statement only tells us what would happen if the grommet had sploffed (plopped the frink), it does not provide any information about whether or not the grommet plopped the frink when it did not sploff.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The grommet did not plop the frink\" from the given statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
