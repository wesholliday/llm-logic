We have two given statements: a) The clug was not fleeked\nb) If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\n\n2. To infer \"The clug was not snugged\" from these statements, we would need to apply the principle of contrapositive in logic. However, without knowing what \"fleeked\" and \"snugged\" mean, it's impossible to determine if these statements follow the rules for applying the contrapositive.\n\n3. Without sufficient information, we cannot infer \"The clug was not snugged\" based on the given statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
