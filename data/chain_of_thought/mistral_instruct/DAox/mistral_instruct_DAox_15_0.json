We have two given statements: a) The dreb was not vroombed\n   b) If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\n\n2. To infer \"The dreb was not spened\" from these statements, we need to apply the rules of logic known as Modus Ponens and Modus Tollens.\n\n3. Modus Ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (if p then q) and we know that p is true, then we can infer that q is also true.\n\n4. However, in our case, we don't have any information about the truth value of \"The dreb was vroombed.\" We only know it wasn't.\n\n5. Modus Tollens, on the other hand, states that if we have a conditional statement (if p then q) and we know that not-q is true, then we can infer that not-p is also true.\n\n6. In our case, we have \"not-q\" in the form of \"The dreb was not spened,\" but we don't have any information about \"not-p.\" We only know \"The dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\n7. Since we cannot directly apply Modus Tollens or Modus Ponens to infer \"The dreb was not spened\" from the given statements, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no.",
