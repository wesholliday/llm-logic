The first statement is \"The whiffle was not shanked.\" This means that the whiffle was hit squarely and did not go off course or veer to the side.\n2. The second statement is \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\" This conditional statement suggests that if the whiffle had been shanked (hit off-center), it would have produced a distinctive sound, such as a \"tink\" sound.\n3. However, we know from the first statement that the whiffle was not shanked, so it follows logically that the whiffle did not produce the \"tink\" sound mentioned in the second statement.\n4. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The whiffle did not tink.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
