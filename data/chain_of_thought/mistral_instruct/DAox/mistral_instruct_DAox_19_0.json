We have two given statements: a) The smonk was not vreebled\nb) If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged\n\n2. To infer \"The smonk was not plagged,\" we need to show that both of these statements are sufficient for that conclusion.\n\n3. Let's consider the first statement: \"The smonk was not vreebled.\" This means that the smonk did not undergo a certain condition (being vreebled).\n\n4. Now let's look at the second statement: \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\" This is a conditional statement, which states that if the smonk is vreebled, then it will be plagged.\n\n5. However, we don't have any information about whether the smonk actually was vreebled or not. The first statement only tells us that it wasn't.\n\n6. Since we cannot determine if the premises of the conditional statement are true (the smonk being both vreebled and plagged), we cannot infer that \"The smonk was not plagged\" based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
