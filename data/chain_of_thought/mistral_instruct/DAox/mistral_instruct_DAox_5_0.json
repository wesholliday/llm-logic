We have two conditional statements:\n   a) If the zinger is fraggled, then the zinger is smoogled (If p, then q).\n   b) The zinger is not fraggled (Not p).\n2. To find out if we can infer \"The zinger was not smoogled\" (Not q), let's apply the rules of logical reasoning:\n   a) If both p and Not q are true, then they are consistent with each other. In this case, since we have 'The zinger is not fraggled' (Not p), we need to check if it's also possible for 'The zinger was not smoogled' (Not q) to be true based on the given information.\n   b) Since the first conditional statement tells us that 'If the zinger is fraggled, then it is smoogled', and we know that 'The zinger is not fraggled', it follows that 'The zinger was not fraggled and therefore not smoogled'.\n3. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The zinger was not smoogled\" (Answer: yes).",
