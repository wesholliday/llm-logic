We know that \"The fribble was not snurgled.\"\n2. We also know that \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\"\n3. However, we don't have any information about whether or not the fribble was actually snurgled. It could be that the fribble was not snurgled, and therefore it did not crink, but it's also possible that the fribble was never snurgled in the first place for some other reason, and we just don't know about the \"crink\" part of the statement.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer \"The fribble did not crink\" with certainty. It's possible that the fribble did not crink because it was not snurgled, but it's also possible that there are other reasons why the fribble did not crink that have nothing to do with whether or not it was snurgled.\n\nAnswer: no.",
