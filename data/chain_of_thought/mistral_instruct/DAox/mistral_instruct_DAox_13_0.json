The reason being that while the first statement tells us that the glip was not put together using the process of slogging, it does not provide any information about whether or not the glip was tragged when it was created using another method or if it was never tragged at all.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements alone, we cannot make the conclusion that 'The glip was not tragged'. Answer: no.",
