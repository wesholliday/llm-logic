We know that \"The splat was not morphed.\"\n2. We also know that \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\"\n\nFrom these two statements alone, we cannot directly infer that \"The splat did not quank\" because there is a missing link between the two statements. The statement \"The splat did not quank\" could be true even if the splat was not morphed, or it could be false and the splat might have quanked for some other reason unrelated to being morphed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information alone, we cannot infer that \"The splat did not quank.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
