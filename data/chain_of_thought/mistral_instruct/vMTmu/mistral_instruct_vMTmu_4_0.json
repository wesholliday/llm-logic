If p (alien visited Mars), then q (robot visited Jupiter)\n2. It's not the case that q (robot visited Jupiter)\n3. Therefore, not-p (alien did not visit Mars)\n\nThis argument is known as a modus tollens form of reasoning. To check its validity, we need to ensure that if both premises are true, then the conclusion must be true as well. Let's assume both premises are true:\n\n1. p (alien visited Mars) is false (since q is false and p implies q).\n2. q (robot visited Jupiter) is false.\n\nSince both premises are assumed to be true, but their conjunction leads to a false conclusion, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no.",
