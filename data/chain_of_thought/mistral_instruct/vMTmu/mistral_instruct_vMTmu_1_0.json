            "content": " To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to apply the rules of logic to its premises and conclusion. Let's analyze each part step by step:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding (Premise 1)\n2. It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Mary was not at the wedding (Conclusion)\n\nFirst, let's check if the premises contradict each other:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding (Premise 1)\n2. Sue was not necessarily at the wedding (Premise 2)\n\nSince Premise 1 states that \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding,\" it implies that whenever Mary is present, Sue is guaranteed to be there as well. However, Premise 2 states that \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This means that there are instances where Sue might not be present even if Mary is.\n\nThis creates a contradiction between the two premises because they cannot both be true at the same time. If it's possible for Mary to attend the wedding without Sue being there, then Premise 1 is false. In this case, the argument is not logically valid since its conclusion does not follow from its premises.\n\nAnswer: no.",
