            "content": " To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to apply the rules of logic to its premises and conclusion. Let's analyze each part step by step:\n\n1. If p (the cake is chocolate), then q (muffins are blueberry). (First premise)\n2. Not q (it's not the case that muffins were blueberry). (Second premise)\n3. Therefore, not p (the cake was not chocolate). (Conclusion)\n\nThis argument is known as a modus tollens argument. To check its validity, we need to ensure that if both premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. Let's test this:\n\n1. If p (cake = chocolate), then q (muffins = blueberry). (Given)\n2. Not q (muffins \u2260 blueberry). (Given)\n3. To prove that not p (cake \u2260 chocolate) is true, we need to show that if p were true, then q would have to be false. In other words, if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins could not be blueberry because of premise 1. Since premise 2 states that the muffins are not blueberry, it follows that the cake cannot be chocolate (premise 1 and 2 together imply not p).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
