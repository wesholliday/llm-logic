If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis (Premise 1)\n2. It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Jeff did not play basketball (Conclusion)\n\nFirst, let's negate Premise 1 to create a hypothesis:\n- If Jeff didn't play basketball, then Amy didn't play tennis\n\nNow we can test the argument using Modus Tollens:\n1. If P, then Q (Premise 1)\n2. Not Q (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, not P (Conclusion)\n\nSince the conclusion follows logically from the premises according to the rules of logic, the answer is: Answer: yes.",
