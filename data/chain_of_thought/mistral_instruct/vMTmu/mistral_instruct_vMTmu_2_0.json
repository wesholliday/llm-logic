            "content": " To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to apply the rules of logic to its premises and conclusion. Let's analyze each part step by step:\n\n1. If p (griffin in forest), then q (unicorn in forest) - First premise\n2. Not-q (unicorn not in forest) - Second premise\n3. Therefore, not-p (griffin not in forest) - Conclusion\n\nNow let's check if the argument follows the rules of logic:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement, which can be written as p \u2192 q.\n2. The second premise states that not-q is true.\n3. To prove that the conclusion (not-p) follows logically from the premises, we need to apply the rule of Modus Ponens: If p \u2192 q and p are true, then q must be true. In this case, we want to show that if p \u2192 q and not-q are true, then not-p must be true. This is an application of the rule of Modus Tollens.\n4. To apply Modus Tollens, we need to ensure that both premises are negations of each other's consequents (the 'if part' remains unchanged). In our case, this condition holds: p \u2192 q and not-q have opposite consequents.\n5. Therefore, if the first premise (p \u2192 q) is true and the second premise (not-q) is also true, then the conclusion (not-p) follows logically from them.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
