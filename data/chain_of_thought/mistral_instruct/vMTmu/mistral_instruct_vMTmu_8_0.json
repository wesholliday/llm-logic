            "content": " To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to apply the rules of logic to its premises and conclusion. Let's analyze each part step by step:\n\n1. If p, then q (First premise)\n2. Not q (Second premise)\n3. Therefore, not p (Conclusion)\n\nThis argument form is known as Modus Tollens. For an argument to be logically valid using this form, both of the following conditions must hold:\n\n1. p must entail q (p implies q).\n2. Not q cannot be true unless not p is also true.\n\nLet's check if these conditions are met in our given argument:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake (p implies q) - This premise states that the two events are related such that if one occurs, the other must occur as well.\n2. It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake (not q) - This premise states that the mummy did not need to be awake for the argument to hold.\n3. Therefore, The vampire was not awake (not p) - Based on our first premise and Modus Tollens rule, if it's not the case that the mummy must have been awake, then the vampire could not have been awake either.\n\nSince both conditions are met, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
