Let's analyze each premise and the conclusion step by step:\n\n1. If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race (P1).\n2. It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race (P2).\n3. Conclusion: Alex did not finish the race.\n\nFirst, let's negate P1 to create a contradiction with P2:\n\n1. If Alex finished the race, then Chris did not finish the race (Negation of P1).\n2. It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race (P2).\n\nNow, we can use the Law of Contradiction to determine if these two premises contradict each other:\n\n1. A and Not-A cannot both be true at the same time.\n\nSince P1 and Negation of P1 contradict each other, it means that one of them must be false. However, we are given P2 as a fact, which is not negated in our analysis. Therefore, if P2 is true, then neither P1 nor its negation can be true, making the argument invalid because its conclusion cannot follow from its premises.\n\nAnswer: no.",
