            "content": " To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to apply the rules of logic to its premises and conclusion. Let's analyze each part step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" This means that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow according to this statement.\n2. The second premise asserts that \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\" This implies that the banana was not necessarily yellow.\n3. From these two premises, we cannot logically deduce that \"The apple was not red\" because the premises do not directly contradict each other. The first premise only establishes a relationship between the colors of the apple and banana if the apple is red. However, the second premise does not guarantee that the apple is not red; it only states that the banana is not required to be yellow.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically conclude that \"The apple was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
