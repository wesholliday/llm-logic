It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Tom did not watch football (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises only establish a conditional relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball. They do not establish that if Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football. Therefore, it's possible for both premises to be true while the conclusion is false. Answer: no.",
