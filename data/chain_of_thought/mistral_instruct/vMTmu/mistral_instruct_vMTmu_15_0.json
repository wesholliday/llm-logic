If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train (Premise 1)\n2. It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Sam did not take a plane (Conclusion)\n\nFirst, let's check if Premises 1 and 2 contradict each other:\n\n1. If P (Sam took a plane), then Q (Erin took a train)\n2. Not-Q (It's not the case that Erin took a train)\n\nSince 'If P, then Q' is logically equivalent to 'Not-P or Q', we can rewrite Premise 1 as:\n\n1'. Not-Sam took a plane or Erin took a train\n\nNow let's see if Premises 1' and 2 contradict each other:\n\n1'. Not-Sam took a plane or Erin took a train\n2. Not-Erin took a train\n\nSince 'Not-A or B' is logically equivalent to 'A and Not-B', we can rewrite Premise 2 as:\n\n2'. Sam took a plane and Erin did not take a train\n\nNow, let's check if Premises 1' and 2' contradict each other. They do! Since contradictory premises lead to an invalid argument, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no.",
