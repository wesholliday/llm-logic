This statement tells us that one of two things must be true \u2013 either the smonk is vreebled or it is plagged.\n3. Now let's analyze statement B. This statement tells us that the smonk is not plagged.\n4. Given statements A and B, can we infer that \"The smonk is vreebled\"? To do this, let's assume the opposite \u2013 i.e., the smonk is not vreebled. If that were true, then according to statement A, it would have to be plagged. However, we know from statement B that it is not plagged, which contradicts our assumption that the smonk is not vreebled but is plagged.\n5. Since our assumption led us to a contradiction, it must be that the original assumption \u2013 that \"The smonk is not vreebled\" \u2013 was incorrect.

Let's break down each statement:\n\n1. \"Either the smonk is vreebled or it is plagged\": This is a disjunction, meaning it can be true if one (but not necessarily both) of the statements is true. For example, if the smonk is vreebled, then this statement is true.\n2. \"The smonk is not plagged\": This is a negation, which means it asserts that something is not true.

In other words, if A is true, then not-A must be false.\n4. Let's test this rule with our statements:\n   - If \"The smonk is vreebled\" were true, then \"The smonk is not plagged\" would have to be false (since we know that \"The smonk is not plagged\" cannot be true if \"The smonk is vreebled\" is).\n   - However, \"The smonk is not plagged\" is given as a fact and is known to be true.
