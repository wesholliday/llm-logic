We are given two statements:\n   a) Either the glip is slogged or it is tragged\n   b) The glip is not tragged\n2. To analyze these statements, we can use the Law of Excluded Middle and the Law of Non-Contradiction from propositional logic:\n   a) The Law of Excluded Middle states that for any proposition p, either p or its negation \u00acp must be true.\n   b) The Law of Non-Contradiction states that for any proposition p, it cannot be both true and false at the same time.\n3. Let's analyze each statement:\n   a) \"Either the glip is slogged or it is tragged\" can be represented as (p \u2228 q), where p = \"The glip is slogged\" and q = \"The glip is tragged.\"\n4. We know that the Law of Excluded Middle holds true, which means that one of p and \u00acp must be true:\n   a) If p is true (i.e., The glip is slogged), then the statement \"Either the glip is slogged or it is tragged\" would hold true because the first disjunct (p) is satisfied.\n5. Now let's analyze the second statement:\n   a) \"The glip is nottragged,\" can be represented as \u00acq, where q = \"The glip is tragged.\"\n6. According to the Law of Non-Contradiction, we cannot have both p and \u00acp being true at the same time (since p and \u00acq are logically equivalent).\n7. Since we already determined that one of p or \u00acp must be true, let's examine the possibilities:\n   a) If p is false (i.e., The glip is not slogged), then \"The glip is not tragged\" holds true because both statements have different propositions. However, this would mean that q is true, which contradicts the given information \"The glip is not tragged.\"\n   b) Therefore, p must be true (i.e., The glip is slogged), and the statement \"Either the glip is slogged or it istragged\" holds true as well because its first disjunct is satisfied.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
