We have two statements: 'Either the flug is blummed or it is zimmed' and 'The flug is not zimmed'.\n2. The first statement can be read in two ways: 'The flug is blummed' OR 'The flug is zimmed', with the OR implying that only one of the conditions can be true at a time. Alternatively, it could be interpreted as 'The flug is blummed AND it is not zimmed', which would be a contradiction and neither statement can be true in this case.\n3. The second statement states that 'The flug is not zimmed'.\n4. If the first statement was meant to imply 'The flug is blummed OR The flug is not zimmed', then no inference about the status of 'The flug' being 'blummed' can be made, because it could still be 'zimmed' and we don't have enough information.\n5. However, if the first statement was meant to imply 'The flug is blummed AND it is not zimmed', then both statements cannot be true, so 'Answer: no'.\n6. If the first statement was intended to mean 'The flug is blummed OR The flug is NOT zimmed' (negation of 'zimmed'), then yes, we can infer that 'The flug is blummed', because the second statement tells us it's not zimmed and if either option in the first statement is false, the entire statement is false, meaning the remaining option must be true.\n7. Therefore, the answer depends on how the statements were meant to be interpreted, so 'Answer: maybe, depending on the intended meaning of \"OR\"'. However, if we are assuming that 'OR' means exclusive (only one can be true) then 'Answer: no'; but if it means inclusive (at least one must be true), then 'Answer: yes'.\n\nWithout more context or additional information about how the statements were intended to be interpreted, it is impossible to know for sure. So, a cautious answer would be 'Answer: maybe'.
