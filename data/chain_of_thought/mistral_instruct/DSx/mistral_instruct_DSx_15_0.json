However, Statement 2 states that \"The dreb is not spened.\" This information contradicts Statement 1 because if the dreb is not spended, then it cannot be the case that \"either the dreb is vroombed or it is spened.\"\n\nStep 3: Conclusion.\n\nGiven the contradiction between the two statements, we cannot infer 'The dreb is vroombed' based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no.",
