Now let's consider both statements together: Since 'The wug is not garpled' tells us that the condition 'garpled' cannot be true, this leaves only one possibility: 'Sproinged'.

The first statement suggests that the wug can be in one of two states - either sproinged or garpled. We don't know which state it's currently in, but we do know that it's not in both states at once (as \"either\" implies a choice).\n\nStep 3: The second statement tells us that the wug is not garpled. This means that the wug cannot be in the garpled state.\n\nStep 4: Given these two pieces of information, can we infer that the wug must be sproinged? Let's think through this logically. If the wug were garpled (which it's not), then by Statement 1, it would also have to be sproinged since \"either\" implies a choice between those two states. However, if it were both sproinged and garpled at the same time, that would contradict the information given in Statement 1.
