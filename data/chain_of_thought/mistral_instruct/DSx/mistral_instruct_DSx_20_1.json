For the purpose of this exercise, we will assume that these words are mutually exclusive, meaning that if an object is bluttered, it cannot be surned, and vice versa.\n\nNow let's consider the two statements given:\n\n1) Either the fleeg is bluttered or it is surned (let's call this statement A)\n2) The fleeg is not surned (let's call this statement B)\n\nFrom these statements, we want to determine if we can infer that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nLet's analyze both possibilities:\n\nCase 1: The fleeg is bluttered\nIf the fleeg is bluttered, then by definition, it cannot be surned (since they are mutually exclusive). Statement B is true in this case since it says \"The fleeg is not surned,\" which is true because the fleeg cannot be surned if it's already bluttered. Thus, statements A and B do not contradict each other when the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nCase 2: The fleeg is not bluttered\nIf the fleeg is not bluttered, then statement A is false since the second part of the statement \"or it is surned\" does not apply to this scenario. Statement B is true in this case since the fleeg is not surned by definition.\n\nSince both cases are consistent with statements A and B, there is no contradiction between them. Therefore, we cannot infer that the fleeg is bluttered from these given statements alone (Answer: no).\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the problem as stated assumes that \"bluttered\" and \"surned\" are mutually exclusive terms.
