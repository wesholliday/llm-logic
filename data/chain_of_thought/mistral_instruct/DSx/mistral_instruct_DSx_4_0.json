(This is a disjunction, meaning it can be either statement A or statement B, but not both at the same time.)\n- Statement 2: The fribble is not crinked.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given statements.\n\nSince Statement 2 tells us that the fribble is not crinked, we know that it cannot be crinked according to Statement 1. However, Statement 1 also tells us that the fribble can be snurgled instead of crinked. So, if the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled based on Statement 1.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes. The given statements allow us to infer that the fribble is snurgled.",
