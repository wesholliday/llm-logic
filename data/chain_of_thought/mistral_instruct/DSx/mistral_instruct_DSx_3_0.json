We have two statements: 'Either the splat is morphed or it is quanked' and 'The splat is not quanked'.\n2. Let's break down the first statement into its logical components: 'The splat is morphed' OR 'The splat is quanked'.\n3. Since we know that 'The splat is not quanked', this means that 'The splat is quanked' must be false.\n4. Therefore, the entire first statement 'Either the splat is morphed or it is quanked' can be simplified to 'The splat is morphed'.\n5. Answer: yes.",
