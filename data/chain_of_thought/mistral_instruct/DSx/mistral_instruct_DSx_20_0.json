We have two statements: \"Either the fleeg is bluttered or it is surned\" and \"The fleeg is not surned.\"\n2. The first statement tells us that one of the two conditions must be true, but we don't know which one.\n3. The second statement tells us that the condition \"The fleeg is surned\" is false.\n4. Since we know that only one of the two conditions can be true, and we have determined that \"The fleeg is surned\" is false, then the other condition must be true.\n5. Therefore, \"The fleeg is bluttered\" must be the true condition.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
