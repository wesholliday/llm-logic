We have two statements given: \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it is plopped\" and \"The grommet is not plopped.\"\n2. Let's first consider what each statement means:\n   - \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it is plopped\": This statement tells us that the grommet must be either in one of two states \u2013 sploffed or plopped. It does not tell us which state it is actually in, only that it is in one of those two states.\n   - \"The grommet is not plopped\": This statement tells us that the grommet is not in the plopped state.\n3. Now let's consider what we can infer from these statements:\n   - Since we know that the grommet must be either sploffed or plopped, and we also know that it is not plopped, it follows logically that the grommet must be sploffed.\n4. Therefore, our answer is: Answer: yes. The given statements allow us to infer that the grommet is sploffed.",
