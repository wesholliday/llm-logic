This statement negates the second possibility from Statement 1.\n\nStep 2: Analyzing the given statements\n\nTo infer 'The wug is flooped' based on the given statements, we need to consider both possibilities presented in Statement 1 and how they relate to Statement 2.\n\nIf 'The wug is not bimmed', then according to Statement 1, 'The wug is flooped'.

But this leads to a contradiction with statement 2.
