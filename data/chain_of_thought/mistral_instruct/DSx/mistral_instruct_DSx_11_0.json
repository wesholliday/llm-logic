We have two statements: \"Either the flug is blummed or it is zimmed\" and \"The flug is not zimmed.\"\n2. The first statement tells us that one of the two conditions (blummed or zimmed) must be true for the flug.\n3. The second statement tells us that the condition \"zimmed\" is false for the flug.\n4. Since we know that only one of the conditions can be true, and we've established that \"zimmed\" is false, then the other condition (blummed) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
