To do this, let's consider the possible implications of each statement:\n\n1) Statement A tells us that the fribble must be either snurgled or crinked, but it doesn't tell us which one is true.\n2) Statement B tells us that the fribble is not crinked, but it doesn't give any information about whether the fribble is snurgled or not.\n\nSince statement B contradicts statement A in regard to the fribble not being crinkled (statement A says it could be crinkled), they cannot both be true at the same time.

It could very well be the case that our initial assumption about statement A being true was incorrect, and that the correct interpretation might actually be \"The fribble is neither snurgled nor crinked.\"\n\nThus, even though we have determined that there must be a false statement among statements A and B based on logical reasoning alone, we cannot infer 'yes' or 'no' to the question of whether the fribble is snurgled without more information.

However, we can use the principle of contrapositive to potentially draw a conclusion:\n\nIf P \u2192 Q is a conditional statement, then its contrapositive is Q \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nIn this case, let's set up Statement 1 as P and 'The fribble is snurgled' as Q:\n\nStatement 1: If the fribble is not crinked, then it is snurgled. (This is the original conditional statement in Statement 1.)\n\nTo find the contrapositive, we need to swap P and Q and negate the statement:\n\nContrapositive: If the fribble is snurgled, then it is not crinked.\n\nNow, if 'The fribble is not crinked' (from Statement 2) is true, according to the contrapositive, it follows that 'The fribble is snurgled' must also be true:\n\nStep 4: Final conclusion\nTherefore, based on the given statements and the principle of contrapositive, we can infer that 'The fribble is snurgled'.\nAnswer: yes",
