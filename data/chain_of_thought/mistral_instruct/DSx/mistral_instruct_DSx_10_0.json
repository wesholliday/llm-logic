We have two statements: \"Either the wug is sproinged or it is garpled\" and \"The wug is not garpled.\"\n2. The first statement tells us that one of the two mutually exclusive conditions must be true for the wug.\n3. The second statement informs us that the condition \"garpled\" is false for the wug.\n4. Since \"garpled\" and \"sproinged\" are mutually exclusive, if we know that \"garpled\" is false, then it follows logically that \"sproinged\" must be true.\n5. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The wug is sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
