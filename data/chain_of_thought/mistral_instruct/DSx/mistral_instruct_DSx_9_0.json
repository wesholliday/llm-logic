(This statement can be read as \"The twonk is either plinked or varnished.\")\n- Statement 2: The twonk is not plinked.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given statements.\n\nSince Statement 2 tells us that the twonk is not plinked, and Statement 1 states that the twonk is either plinked or varnished, it follows that the twonk must be varnished because the other alternative (plinked) has been ruled out.\n\nStep 3: Provide the answer.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
