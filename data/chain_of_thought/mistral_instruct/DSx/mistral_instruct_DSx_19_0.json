We have two statements: \"Either the smonk is vreebled or it is plagged\" and \"The smonk is not plagged.\"\n2. The first statement tells us that one of the two possibilities (either \"vreebled\" or \"plagged\") must be true for the smonk.\n3. The second statement tells us that the opposite of \"plagged\" (which is \"not plagged\") is true for the smonk.\n4. Since we know that one of the two possibilities (\"vreebled\" or \"plagged\") must be true, and we also know that \"The smonk is not plagged,\" it follows that the other possibility, \"The smonk is vreebled,\" must be true.\n5. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The smonk is vreebled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
