Since we know one thing must be true between \"the dreb is vroombed\" and \"the dreb is spened,\" and we have determined that the second statement does not refute the first (because the dreb cannot be both spent and not spent at the same time), it follows logically that the first statement, \"Either the dreb is vroombed or it is spended,\" must be true.\n5.
