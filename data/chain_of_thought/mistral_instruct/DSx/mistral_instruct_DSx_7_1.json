To determine if the whiffle was shanked based on the given statements alone, we need more information.

The logical negation of \"The whiffle is not tinked\" is \"The whiffle is tinked,\" so the combined statement becomes: \"It's not the case that the whiffle is not tinked,\" or equivalently, \"Either the whiffle is shanked or it is tinked.\"\n3.
