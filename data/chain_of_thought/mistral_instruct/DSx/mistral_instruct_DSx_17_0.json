(This statement implies that the flob cannot be both skizzled and movated at the same time.)\nStatement 2: The flob is not movated.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given statements\n\nSince Statement 2 tells us that the flob is not movated, it follows that the flob cannot be movated as stated in Statement 1. However, Statement 1 also tells us that if the flob is not movated, then it must be skizzled. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the flob is skizzled.\n\nStep 3: Provide the answer\n\nAnswer: yes.",
