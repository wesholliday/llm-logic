This statement means that whenever the tizzer is on, the goom is always in the state of being snurpled. However, it does not provide any information about the relationship between the tizzer, plink light, and the state of the goom when both the tizzer is on and the plink light is out. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'If the tizzer is on and the plink light is out, then the goom is snurpled' is true based on the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
