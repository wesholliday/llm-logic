If the glop is on the brink, then the skrizzle is plonked (P -> Q)\n\nThis statement means that whenever the condition P (glop is on the brink) is true, the consequence Q (skrizzle is plonked) must also be true.\n\n2. Now we want to know if we can infer 'If the glop is on the brink and the bloop is zorped, then the skrizzle is plonked' (P -> Q and R -> S -> P -> Q)\n\nTo do this, we need to check if adding another condition R (bloop is zorped) does not change the truth of P (glop is on the brink), and that Q (skrizzle is plonked) still follows from P.\n\nSince neither 'P' nor 'R' nor their relationship with each other are given in the problem statement, we cannot definitively say whether or not the inference is valid without more information.\n\nAnswer: undefined.",
