It means that whenever the condition on the left side is true, the consequence on the right side is also true.\n\nHowever, the new statement we want to infer, 'If the klank is hooped and the wuggy is out of zloat, then the wuggy will zink,' is a different conditional statement with an additional condition (wuggy being out of zloat).\n\nTo determine if this new statement follows logically from the original one, we need to check if the second condition (wuggy being out of zloat) affects the truth of the consequence (wuggy will zink), given that the first condition (klank being hooped) is true.\n\nWithout any further context or information about the relationship between klank, wuggy, hooping, and zinking, it's impossible to definitively say whether this new statement follows logically from the original one or not. Therefore, we cannot answer this question with a simple 'yes' or 'no'.\n\nAnswer: undefined.",
