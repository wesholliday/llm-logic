If the trankle is sploofed, then the zorple will quibble.\n\nThis statement means that whenever the trankle is sploofed, the zorple will always quibble. It does not provide any information about the relationship between the trankle being sploofed and the drib being flanked, or how that might affect the zorple's behavior.\n\nTo infer 'If the trankle is sploofed and the drib is flanked, then the zorple will quibble', we would need to have additional information indicating that the drib being flanked has no effect on the zorple's behavior when the trankle is sploofed. Without such information, we cannot make this inference based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
