While it is true that if Erin took a train and Sam took a plane, then those are two different modes of transportation, the reverse is also possible - they could have taken different modes of transportation on separate occasions. Therefore, even though Erin took a train and Sam has taken a plane at some point, we cannot be sure that Sam took a plane on the same occasion as Erin took a train. Answer: no.",
