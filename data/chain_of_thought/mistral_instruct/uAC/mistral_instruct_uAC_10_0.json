The first statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" suggests that when the dog is inside, the cat is outside. The second statement \"Also, the cat was outside\" confirms that the cat is currently outside. Therefore, since the cat being outside satisfies the condition stated in the first sentence for the dog to be inside, it follows logically that the dog must have been inside at some point in time. Answer: yes.",
