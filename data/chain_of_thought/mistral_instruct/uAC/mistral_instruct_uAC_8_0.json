The statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" means that if the vampire is awake, it implies that the mummy is also awake. This is a conditional statement.\n2. The second statement \"The mummy was awake\" is a factual statement.\n3. To infer whether the vampire was awake or not based on these two statements, we need to consider both of them together. Since the first statement implies that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is awake (and we know the mummy is awake), it follows logically that the vampire must also be awake.\n4. Therefore, the answer is: Answer: yes.",
