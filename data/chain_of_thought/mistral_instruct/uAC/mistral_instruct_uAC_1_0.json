Sue was at the wedding.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that Mary was at the wedding based on these statements, we need to apply the rules of logic. The second statement tells us that Sue was indeed present at the wedding. The first statement tells us that if Mary was there, then Sue would also be there. However, it does not necessarily mean that Mary was there just because Sue was.\n\nTherefore, even though we know Sue was at the wedding, we cannot definitively conclude that Mary was there based on the given information alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
