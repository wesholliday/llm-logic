We have two statements: \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" and \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n2. The first statement tells us that the keys can either be in the drawer or dangling in the cabinet, but it doesn't exclude the possibility of them being in the drawer.\n3. The second statement informs us that the keys cannot be dangling in the cabinet.\n4. Since both statements are given, and neither one contradicts the other, we can infer that the keys must be in the drawer because the alternative (dangling in the cabinet) has been ruled out.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
