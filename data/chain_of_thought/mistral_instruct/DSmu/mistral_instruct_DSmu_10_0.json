This means that either one of the conditions can be true, but they cannot both be true at the same time.\n\nStep 3: The second statement, \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed,\" negates the second part of the disjunction. This means that the missing sock is not under the bed.\n\nStep 4: Since we know that the missing sock cannot be both in the laundry basket and under the bed at the same time, and we also know that it's not under the bed, then the only remaining possibility is that it must be in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
