We have two statements: \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist\" and \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\"\n2. The first statement tells us that there are only two possibilities for the location of the watch: either it's charging on the dresser or it's on his wrist.\n3. The second statement informs us that the watch is not on his wrist.\n4. Since we know that the watch cannot be on his wrist, and according to the first statement, there are only two possibilities for the watch's location, then the only remaining possibility must be true: \"The watch is charging on the dresser.\"\n\nAnswer: yes.",
