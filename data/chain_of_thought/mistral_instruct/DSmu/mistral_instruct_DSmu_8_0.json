We have two statements: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" and \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n2. The first statement tells us that the remote control could be either on the coffee table or hidden under the couch, but it doesn't necessarily have to be in either location.\n3. The second statement tells us that the remote control is not hiding under the couch.\n4. However, the first statement also allows for the possibility that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n5. Since we know that the remote control is not hidden under the couch, but it could still be on the coffee table according to the first statement, then our conclusion should be that \"The remote control is on the coffee table\" is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
