We know that \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" represents two mutually exclusive possibilities.\n2. We also know that \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\"\n3. Since these statements are contradictory, only one of them can be true at a time.\n4. Given that \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet,\" it follows that the other possibility, \"The jacket is draped over the chair,\" must be true.",
