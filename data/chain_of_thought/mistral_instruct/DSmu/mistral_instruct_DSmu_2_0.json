We have two statements: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" and \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n2. The first statement tells us that the book can be either on the shelf or on the table, but it doesn't specify which one.\n3. The second statement tells us that the book cannot be resting on the table.\n4. However, the second statement does not necessarily mean that the book is on the shelf. It only means that the book is not on the table.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer for certain that \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
