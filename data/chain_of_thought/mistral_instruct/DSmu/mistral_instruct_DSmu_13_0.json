It is not the case that the toy must be on the bookshelf.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that:\n\n1. If it's not the case that the toy must be on the bookshelf, then it could still be in the toy box (since it could also be in the toy box according to the first statement).\n2. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that the toy is in the toy box, but we can infer that it's a possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes (it's a possibility, not a certainty).",
