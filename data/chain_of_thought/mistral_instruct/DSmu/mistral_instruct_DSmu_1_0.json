We have two statements: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n2. The first statement can be read as \"Fido is either inside or in the garden,\" which is equivalent to saying \"It is not the case that Fido is only in the garden.\"\n3. The second statement says \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" which means that it is possible for Fido to be somewhere other than the garden.\n4. Since both statements allow for the possibility of Fido being somewhere other than the garden, and neither statement explicitly states that Fido is inside, we cannot infer \"Fido is inside\" based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
