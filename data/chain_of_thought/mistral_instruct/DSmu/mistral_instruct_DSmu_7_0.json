We have two statements: \"Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet,\" and \"It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\"\n2. The first statement tells us that there are only two possibilities for the location of the umbrella: either it's in the car, or it's tucked away in the closet.\n3. The second statement informs us that the umbrella is not tucked away in the closet.\n4. Since we know that the umbrella cannot be in the closet (from the second statement), and we also know that there are only two possibilities for its location (from the first statement), then it must be in the car.\n5. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can infer \"The umbrella is in the car.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
