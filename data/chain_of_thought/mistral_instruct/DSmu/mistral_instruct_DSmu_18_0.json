We have two statements:\n   a) Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\n   b) It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\n2. Let's analyze each statement:\n   a) The first statement tells us that there are only two possibilities for the location of the notebook: in the drawer or on the nightstand.\n   b) The second statement informs us that the notebook cannot be on the nightstand.\n3. Since the notebook cannot be on the nightstand, it must be in the drawer according to the first statement.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The notebook is in the drawer'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
