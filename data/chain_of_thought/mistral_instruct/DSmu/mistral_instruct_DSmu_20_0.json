We have two statements: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" and \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n2. The first statement tells us that there are only two possibilities for the location of the sunglasses: either in her bag or on her head.\n3. The second statement informs us that the sunglasses cannot be on her head, so they must be somewhere else.\n4. Since we know that the sunglasses cannot be on her head and there are no other mentioned possibilities, it follows logically that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
