It does not provide any information about which option is true.\n2. \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" - This statement negates the second option from the first statement, meaning that the milk is not required to be in the fridge. However, it does not necessarily mean that the milk is on the counter.\n\nTo infer 'The milk is on the counter', we would need additional information that confirms this location. Since we don't have any such information, we cannot make that conclusion based on the given statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
