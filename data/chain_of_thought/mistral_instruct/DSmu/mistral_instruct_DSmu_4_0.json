We have two statements:\n   a) Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom\n   b) It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom\n\n2. Let's analyze each statement:\n   a) The first statement tells us that there are only two possibilities for the cat's location: napping on the couch or playing in the bedroom.\n   b) The second statement informs us that the cat is not playing in the bedroom.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the implications of these statements:\n   a) Since we know that the cat cannot be playing in the bedroom, the only remaining possibility is that it must be napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
