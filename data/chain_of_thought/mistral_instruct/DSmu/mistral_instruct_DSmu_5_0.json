We have two statements: \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" and \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n2. The first statement tells us that the cookies can either be in the jar or hidden in the pantry, but it doesn't specify which one is true.\n3. The second statement informs us that the cookies cannot be hidden in the pantry, meaning they must be somewhere else.\n4. Since we know that the cookies cannot be hidden in the pantry, and the only other option given in the first statement is for the cookies to be in the jar, it follows logically that the cookies must be in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
