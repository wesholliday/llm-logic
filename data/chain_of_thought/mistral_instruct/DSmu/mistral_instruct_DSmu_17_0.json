We have two statements: \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack\" and \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\"\n2. The first statement tells us that there are only two possibilities for the scarf: either it's in the backpack, or it's on the coat rack.\n3. The second statement tells us that the scarf cannot be on the coat rack.\n4. Since we know that the scarf cannot be on the coat rack, and we also know that there are only two possibilities for the scarf (according to the first statement), then it must be in the backpack.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
