Without any context or definition provided, it is impossible to know for certain what these terms mean. However, based on common English usage, \"to plook something\" does not seem to be related to \"to nug something\". Therefore, just because one event (plooking) may cause another event (nugging), it does not necessarily follow that the reverse is also true.\n\nAnswer: no.",
