Compacted snow and sprouting frink are two unrelated concepts. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the relationship between the compacted snow and the sprouting frink based on this statement alone.\n\nFurthermore, the second conditional statement \"If the snow sprouted the frink, then the snow was compacted\" is also not a valid argument for the same reason.\n\nAnswer: No.",
