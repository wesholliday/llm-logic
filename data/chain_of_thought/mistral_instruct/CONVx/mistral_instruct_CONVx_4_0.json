This means that the event of snurgling causes the event of crinkling.\n\nThe second statement, 'If the fribble crinked, then the fribble was snurgled', is also a conditional statement that can be read as \" whenever the fribble crinkles, it was previously snurgled\". This means that the event of crinkling is a result of a previous snurgling.\n\nThese two statements are not logically equivalent because the order of events is different. In the first statement, snurgling causes crinkling, while in the second statement, crinkling is a result of a previous snurgling. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the fribble crinked, then the fribble was snurgled' from 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked'.\n\nAnswer: no.",
