In this case, if it's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars, then it's possible that the alien didn't visit Mars at all, but it's also possible that the alien visited some other planet or didn't visit Mars for some other reason. The conclusion 'The alien might not have visited Mars' follows logically from the premise.",
