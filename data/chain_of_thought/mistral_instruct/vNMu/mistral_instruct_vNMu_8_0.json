The logical form of the argument can be represented as follows:\n\n1. It's not the case that the vampire must have been awake.\n2. Therefore, the vampire might not have been awake.\n\nThis argument is valid in classical logic because the conclusion follows logically from the premise. The negation of a conditional statement (It's not the case that p implies q) is logically equivalent to the conjunction of the negation of the antecedent (not-p) and the negation of the consequent (not-q). In this case, the argument can be represented as:\n\n1. It's not the case that the vampire was awake implies the vampire was not awake.\n2. The vampire was not awake.\n3. Therefore, the vampire might not have been awake.\n\nSince the conclusion follows logically from the premise, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
