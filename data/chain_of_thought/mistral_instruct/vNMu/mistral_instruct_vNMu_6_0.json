The negation of a statement implies that the statement is not necessarily false, and therefore, it leaves open the possibility that the statement might be false for reasons other than the one explicitly ruled out in the premise. In this case, if Sue did not have to choose pizza (it was not necessary), then she could have chosen something else or even not made a choice at all. Thus, the argument is valid because the conclusion follows logically from the premise.",
