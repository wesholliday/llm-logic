This is known as a conditional proof, specifically the rule of double negation elimination in logic. In this case, the argument can be represented as:\n\n1. It's not the case that the dog must have been inside.\n2. If it's not the case that the dog must have been inside, then the dog might not have been inside.\n\nSince the second premise is a logical truth (known as De Morgan's law), the argument is valid. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
