The negation of a statement implies that the statement is not necessarily false, and therefore it leaves open the possibility that the statement might be false but also might not be. In other words, if it's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball, then it's possible that he didn't play basketball at all, but it's also possible that there was some misunderstanding or mistake and he did in fact play. So the argument is valid because its conclusion follows logically from its premise.",
