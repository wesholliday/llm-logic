The negation of a statement implies that the statement is not necessarily true, and therefore it leaves open the possibility that the statement might not be the case. In this argument, the premise denies that the milk must be on the counter, which means that it's possible for the milk to be somewhere other than on the counter. The conclusion acknowledges this possibility by stating that the milk might not be on the counter.",
