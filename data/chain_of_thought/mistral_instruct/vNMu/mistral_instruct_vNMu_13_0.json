The modus tollens argument form can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not-Q.\n3. Therefore, not-P.\n\nIn your case, P represents 'the toy must be in the toy box' and Q represents 'the toy is in the toy box'. The argument form you have provided follows this structure, so it is logically valid.",
