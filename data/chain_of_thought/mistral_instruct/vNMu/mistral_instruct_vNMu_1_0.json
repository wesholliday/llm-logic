The negative form of a conditional statement ('It's not the case that if P then Q') is logically equivalent to the statement 'It's possible that P and Q are false, or P is true and Q is false.' In this case, 'Mary might not have been at the wedding' follows logically from 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding'.",
