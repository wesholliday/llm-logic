It states that if the fribble is snurgled, then the fribble crinkles. This means that the crinkling of the fribble is a result or consequence of it being snurgled.\n\nStep 3: Consider the available information\n\nWe have two statements. The first statement tells us that the fribble crinkled. The second statement tells us that if the fribble is snurgled, then it crinkles.\n\nStep 4: Apply logical reasoning\n\nSince we know that the fribble crinkled (from Statement 1), and according to Statement 2, the crinkling of the fribble is a result of it being snurgled, we can infer that the fribble was snurgled.\n\nStep 5: Write the answer\n\nAnswer: yes",
