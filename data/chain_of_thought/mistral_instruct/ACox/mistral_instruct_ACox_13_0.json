However, we don't know what 'quanked' means in this context.\n\nStatement 2: This conditional statement is saying that if the splat was morphed (changed from one form to another), then it was also quanked.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possible implications of Statement 2\n\nIf Statement 2 is true, it means that morphing the splat necessarily results in it being quanked. However, we cannot infer that morphing caused the initial quanking, only that if the splat was morphed at any point, then it was also quanked at some other point.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate whether Statement 1 can be inferred from Statements 1 and 2\n\nSince we cannot determine from the given information whether morphing caused the initial quanking or if quanking occurred before morphing, we cannot infer that 'The splat was morphed' directly from the statements provided.\n\nAnswer: No.",
