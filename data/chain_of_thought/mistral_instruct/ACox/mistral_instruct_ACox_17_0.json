This statement is telling us that if the whiffle was shanked (which means hit poorly or off-center), then it would make a certain sound (tink) when it was hit.\n\nHowever, having 'The whiffle was tinked' does not necessarily mean that it was shanked. The statement only tells us that there was a certain sound made when the whiffle was hit. It could have been hit squarely and still produced that sound for various reasons.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The whiffle was shanked'.\n\nAnswer: no.",
