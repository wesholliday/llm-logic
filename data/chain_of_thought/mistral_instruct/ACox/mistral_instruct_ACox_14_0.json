We have two statements: \"The fribble was crinked\" and \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble was crinked.\"\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it describes a relationship between two events. In this case, the statement says that if the fribble was snurgled, then it was also crinked.\n3. However, the first statement does not necessarily mean that the fribble was snurgled before it was crinked. It only tells us that the fribble was crinked at some point.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The fribble was snurgled\" with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no.",
