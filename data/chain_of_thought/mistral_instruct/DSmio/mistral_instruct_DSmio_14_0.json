Statement 1 states that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge, but it does not explicitly say that the milk is on the counter.\n\nStep 3: Consider all possible scenarios\n\nScenario A: The milk is on the counter (not chilling)\nScenario B: The milk is in the fridge (chilling)\n\nSince Statement 2 states that there are only two possibilities, and Statement 1 does not contradict this, we cannot infer for certain that the milk is on the counter based on the given information. However, it is possible that the milk is on the counter, so the answer could be 'yes', but it's not a definitive conclusion.\n\nStep 4: Write the final answer\n\nAnswer: yes (with a caution that this is an inference with some uncertainty)",
