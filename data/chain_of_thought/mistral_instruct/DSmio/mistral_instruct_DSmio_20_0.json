In this case, the alternatives are \"the sunglasses are in her bag\" and \"they must be perched on her head.\"\n\nStep 3: Consider how the first statement fits with the alternatives in the second statement\n\nThe first statement suggests that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. However, it does not necessarily mean that they are in her bag. The first statement leaves open other possibilities as well, such as the sunglasses being in her pocket or having been lost or dropped.\n\nStep 4: Determine if the given statements allow for the conclusion 'The sunglasses are in her bag'\n\nNo, the given statements do not allow for the conclusion that 'The sunglasses are in her bag'. While it is possible that the sunglasses could be in her bag based on Statement 2, Statement 1 does not provide enough information to make that conclusion with certainty. Answer: no.",
