The second statement presents two possibilities for where the cookies could be located. Neither statement directly contradicts each other, and both could potentially be true at the same time.\n\nStep 3: Consider the logical implications of the statements\nThe first statement does not provide enough information to infer that the cookies are in the jar. While it is possible that the cookies are in the jar and not hidden in the pantry, there are also other possibilities (such as the cookies being hidden somewhere else). The second statement only suggests that if the cookies are not in the jar, then they must be hidden in the pantry. It does not definitively state that the cookies are in the jar or that they are not hidden elsewhere.\n\nStep 4: Determine the answer based on the given statements\nAnswer: No. The given statements do not provide enough information to infer that the cookies are in the jar.",
