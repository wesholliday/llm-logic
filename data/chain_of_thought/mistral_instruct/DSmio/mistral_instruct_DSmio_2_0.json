However, we need to consider that 'must' in the second statement might imply a condition or assumption that is not necessarily true.\n\nStep 3: Consider possible scenarios.\n\n- Scenario 1: The book is on the shelf. In this case, the first statement would be false, and the second statement would be true since the book cannot be resting on the table if it's on the shelf.\n- Scenario 2: The book is not on the shelf or anywhere else visible. In this case, both statements could be true - the book might not be on the table (because it's not there at all), and it also might not be on the shelf (since it's not there either).\n\nStep 4: Eliminate impossible scenarios.\n\nSince we cannot infer for certain that the book is not anywhere in the room, we cannot eliminate Scenario 2 completely. However, based on the given information alone, we cannot definitively conclude that the book is on the shelf (Scenario 1).\n\nStep 5: Provide final answer.\n\nAnswer: no.",
