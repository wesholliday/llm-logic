We know that \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\" This means it could be somewhere else, such as on the coffee table. However, it doesn't guarantee that it is there.\n2. The second statement says \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\" This statement suggests two possibilities but does not exclude other locations where the remote control might be.\n3. To infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table,\" we would need more information that definitively places it there, such as \"The remote control is on the coffee table and nowhere else.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
