However, the first statement only suggests a possibility that the toy might not be on the bookshelf, it does not necessarily mean that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nStep 3: Consider all possible scenarios\n\nIf the toy is not on the bookshelf, it could be in another location such as the floor or under the bed. We cannot infer for certain that the toy is in the toy box based on the given statements alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
