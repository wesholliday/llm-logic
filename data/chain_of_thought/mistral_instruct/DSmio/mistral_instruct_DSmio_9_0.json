Statement 1, \"The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor,\" suggests that the missing piece could still be on the floor but not easily visible. It does not necessarily mean that it is not there at all.\n2. Statement 2, \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor,\" states that there are only two possibilities: either the piece is in the box or it is hidden on the floor. However, this statement does not provide any evidence that the piece is actually in the box.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
