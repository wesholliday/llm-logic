We have two conditional statements: If p (alien visited Mars), then q (robot visited Jupiter). Not p (alien did not visit Mars).\n2. To find out if we can infer not-q (robot did not visit Jupiter) from p being false, we need to consider the truth table for conditional statements:\n   - If p is true and q is true, then the statement \"If p, then q\" is true.\n   - If p is true and q is false, then the statement \"If p, then q\" is false (a contradiction).\n   - If p is false and q is true, the statement \"If p, then q\" is still true because the condition p has not been met, so the truth or falsity of q does not matter.\n   - If p is false and q is false, then the statement \"If p, then q\" is true (a tautology).\n3. In our case, we know that p is false (alien did not visit Mars), but we don't have enough information to determine the truth value of q (robot visited Jupiter).\n4. Since the conditional statement \"If p, then q\" can still be true even if p is false and q is either true or false, we cannot infer that not-q (robot did not visit Jupiter) from p being false alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
