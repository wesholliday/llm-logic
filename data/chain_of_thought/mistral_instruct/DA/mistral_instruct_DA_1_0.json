Mary was not at the wedding (given statement).\n\nNow let's consider what we can infer from these statements:\n\nSince Mary was not at the wedding, it means that the condition in the first statement (\"If Mary was at the wedding\") is not met. Therefore, Sue was not necessarily at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no.",
