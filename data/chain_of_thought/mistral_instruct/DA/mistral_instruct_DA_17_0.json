(Conditional statement)\nStatement 2: Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement that says if Ben eats pasta, then Kate eats the salad. However, we know from Statement 2 that Ben did not eat pasta. This means that the condition (Ben eating pasta) in the conditional statement does not hold true. Therefore, we cannot directly infer anything about Kate's actions based on this information alone.\n\nStep 3: Consider possible scenarios.\n\nThere are two possible scenarios to consider here:\n\nScenario A: Ben did not eat pasta, but Kate still ate the salad. In this case, the conditional statement would not hold true (since the 'if' part does not occur), but it does not necessarily mean that Kate did not eat the salad.\n\nScenario B: Ben did not eat pasta, and Kate also did not eat the salad. In this scenario, both the 'if' part and the 'then' part of the conditional statement do not hold true.\n\nStep 4: Make a conclusion based on the given information.\n\nSince we cannot directly infer anything about Kate's actions based on the given information alone, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no.",
