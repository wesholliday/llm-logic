Alex did not finish the race (let's call this statement B).\n3. From statements A and B, we cannot infer that Chris did not finish the race.\n4. The reason is that statement A only tells us that if Alex finished, then Chris did; it does not guarantee that they both finished. Statement B tells us that Alex did not finish. Therefore, it's possible that Chris still finished the race.\n5. To infer that Chris did not finish, we would need additional information that contradicts statement A (such as 'Chris did not finish the race').",
