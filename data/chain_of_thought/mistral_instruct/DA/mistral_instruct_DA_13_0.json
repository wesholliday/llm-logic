The car was not red.\n\nStep 2: Analyze each statement independently.\n\nStatement 1 (Conditional Statement): If the car was red, then the truck was blue. This means that if the condition (car being red) is true, then the consequence (truck being blue) must be true. But it does not guarantee that the consequence is false when the condition is false.\n\nStatement 2: The car was not red.\n\nStep 3: Determine if we can infer 'The truck was not blue'.\n\nSince Statement 2 tells us that the car was not red, and Statement 1 states that if the car is red, then the truck is blue, it does not directly follow that the truck is not blue when the car is not red. The conditional statement only establishes a relationship between the car's color and the truck's color when the car is red.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The truck was not blue' based on the given statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
