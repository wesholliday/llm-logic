Sam did not take a plane.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the implications of each statement.\n\nStatement 1 implies that if Sam takes a plane, then Erin takes a train. It does not state that Erin cannot take a train if Sam doesn't take a plane.\n\nStatement 2 states that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possible scenarios based on the given statements.\n\nScenario 1: Sam took a plane, and Erin took a train (This scenario is inconsistent with statement 2).\n\nScenario 2: Sam did not take a plane, and Erin took a train (This scenario is consistent with both statements).\n\nStep 4: Determine if we can infer 'Erin did not take a train' based on the given statements.\n\nNo, we cannot infer that 'Erin did not take a train' based on the given statements. The statements only tell us that Sam did not take a plane and that if he took a plane, then Erin took a train. They do not provide enough information to conclude that Erin did not take a train when Sam didn't take a plane.\n\nAnswer: no.",
