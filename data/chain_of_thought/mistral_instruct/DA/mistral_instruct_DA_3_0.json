If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel (given statement).\n2. The book was not written by James.\n\nNow, let's consider what we know and don't know based on these statements:\n\nWe know that if James wrote the book, it would be a mystery novel. However, we also know that he didn't write the book. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that the book is not a mystery novel just from these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
