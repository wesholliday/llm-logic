The vampire was not awake (this is stated in the second premise).\n\nNow, let's consider what we can infer from these two statements:\n\nSince the vampire was not awake, it means that the condition for the mummy to be awake (as stated in the first premise) does not hold true. Therefore, based on this information, we cannot infer that the mummy was not awake, but rather, we can infer that we don't have enough information to determine whether the mummy is awake or not.\n\nAnswer: no.",
