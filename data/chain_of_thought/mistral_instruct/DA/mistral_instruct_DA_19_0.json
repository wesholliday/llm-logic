We have two conditional statements: If p (Tom watches football), then q (Jen watches basketball). Not p (Tom does not watch football).\n2. The first statement implies that if Tom watches football, Jen watches basketball. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that if Tom doesn't watch football, Jen doesn't watch basketball.\n3. To infer that \"Jen did not watch basketball\" from \"Tom did not watch football,\" we would need to know that the conditional statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is a necessary condition, meaning that whenever Tom watches football, Jen must also watch basketball, and vice versa.\n4. Without this additional information, we cannot infer that \"Jen did not watch basketball\" from \"Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
