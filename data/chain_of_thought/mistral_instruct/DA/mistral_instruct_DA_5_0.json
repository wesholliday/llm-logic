Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement that says if Jeff plays basketball, then Amy plays tennis. However, it does not guarantee that both Jeff and Amy play their respective sports. It only establishes a relationship between their activities.\n\nThe second statement states that Jeff did not play basketball. This means that the condition in the first statement (Jeff playing basketball) is false.\n\nStep 3: Determine if we can infer 'Amy did not play tennis'.\n\nSince the given statements do not guarantee that both Jeff and Amy actually participate in their respective sports, we cannot definitively say that Amy did not play tennis based on the information provided. The first statement only establishes a relationship between their activities, but it does not necessarily mean they both engage in those activities. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Amy did not play tennis' from the given statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
