We have two conditional statements: If P (shirt is cotton) then Q (pants are denim), and Not P (shirt is not cotton).\n2. The first statement tells us that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim.\n3. The second statement tells us that the shirt is not cotton.\n4. To determine if we can infer \"The pants were not denim\" from these statements, let's consider what happens when a conditional statement is negated:\n   - If P then Q is equivalent to Not Q implies Not P.\n5. In our case, the original statement is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This can be written as \"Not denim implies Not cotton\" or \"If the pants are not denim, then the shirt is not cotton.\"\n6. The second statement is \"The shirt was not cotton.\"\n7. To infer that \"The pants were not denim,\" we would need to have \"Not cotton implies Not denim,\" but we only have \"Not denim implies Not cotton.\"\n8. Since we don't have the direct implication \"Not cotton implies Not denim,\" we cannot infer that \"The pants were not denim\" from these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
