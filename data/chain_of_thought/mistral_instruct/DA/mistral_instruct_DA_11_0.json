This means that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry.\n\nGiven statement 2 states that the cake was not chocolate. Since we know that the cake being chocolate implies that the muffins are blueberry, and we have been told that the cake was not chocolate, it follows logically that the muffins cannot both be blueberry and not be blueberry at the same time. Therefore, the muffins must not be blueberry.\n\nStep 3: State your conclusion.\n\nAnswer: The muffins were not blueberry.",
