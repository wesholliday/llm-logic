The bear was not in the cave.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (bear in the cave) is true, then the consequence (wolf in the den) is also true. However, the second statement states that the bear was not in the cave. This directly contradicts the condition of the first statement. Since we cannot have a false condition in a valid argument, the entire conditional statement must be false.\n\nStep 3: Determine if 'The wolf was not in the den' can be inferred from the given statements.\n\nSince the first statement is false, it does not provide any valid information about the wolf being in or out of the den. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the wolf based on the given statements alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
