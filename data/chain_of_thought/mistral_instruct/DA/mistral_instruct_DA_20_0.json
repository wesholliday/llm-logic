The apple was not red.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement with the form \"If P, then Q.\" This means that if the condition P (apple being red) is true, then the consequence Q (banana being yellow) must be true as well. However, it does not necessarily mean that if P is false, then Q must also be false.\n\nThe second statement states that the apple was not red.\n\nStep 3: Apply logical reasoning.\n\nSince we know that the apple was not red, and the conditional statement only tells us about the relationship between a red apple and a yellow banana, it does not provide enough information to infer that the banana was not yellow based on the given statements alone.\n\nStep 4: Write your answer.\n\nAnswer: no.",
