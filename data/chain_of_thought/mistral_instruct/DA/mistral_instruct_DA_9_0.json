            "content": " To answer this question, let's use the rules of logical reasoning:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt (Let A be \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and B be \"Mark bought the blue shirt\"). This statement is an implication, denoted as A \u2192 B.\n2. Lisa did not buy the red shirt (denoted as \u00acA).\n3. To determine if we can infer 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt' (denoted as \u00acB), we need to apply the rules of logical reasoning:\n   a. Using the contrapositive, we have that if B is false, then A must be false. In other words, \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA.\n   b. From our given statements, we have \u00acA and want to infer \u00acB.\n   c. To apply the rule of modus tollens (which states that from A \u2192 B and \u00acA, we can infer \u00acB), we need to ensure that A \u2192 B is a valid implication. In our case, it is given as a premise.\n4. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can apply modus tollens and infer 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
