It means that if the condition (Sue choosing pizza) is true, then the consequence (Bob choosing pasta) must also be true.\n\nStep 3: The second statement is \"Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n\nStep 4: To determine if we can infer 'Bob did not choose pasta', let's consider what would happen if Sue didn't choose pizza. According to the first statement, if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. But since Sue didn't choose pizza, the condition of the conditional statement is false.\n\nStep 5: A false condition does not guarantee a true consequence. In fact, it could result in an undefined or unknowable consequence. So, just because Sue didn't choose pizza doesn't mean we can infer that Bob didn't choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: No.",
