This means that it could also be in some other location.\n\nStatement 2 gives us two possibilities for the remote control's location: either on the coffee table or hiding under the couch.\n\nStep 3: Now let's consider both statements together. Since Statement 1 tells us that the remote control can be somewhere other than under the couch, and Statement 2 confirms this by giving us another possible location (the coffee table), we can infer that 'The remote control is on the coffee table'.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
