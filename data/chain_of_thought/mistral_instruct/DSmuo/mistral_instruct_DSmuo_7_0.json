The first statement tells us that it is not necessary for the umbrella to be tucked away in the closet. This means that even though the umbrella doesn't have to be in the closet, it could still be in the car without violating the first statement.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the given statements\n\nSince the first statement does not prevent the umbrella from being in the car and the second statement states that the umbrella can only be in one of two places (car or closet), it follows that the umbrella could indeed be in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
