This means that it could be ringing somewhere else, such as in the living room.\n\nStatement 2 gives us two possibilities: either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen. However, Statement 1 tells us that it's not necessarily ringing in the kitchen, so the second part of Statement 2 (it must be ringing in the kitchen) cannot be true.\n\nStep 3: Use the available information to answer the question\n\nSince we know that Statement 2's second part is not true, and Statement 1 does not exclude the possibility of the phone being in the living room, we can infer that 'The phone is in the living room' is a valid conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
