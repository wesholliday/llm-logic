The first alternative is \"the keys are in the drawer,\" and the second alternative is \"they must be dangling in the cabinet.\" Since these alternatives are mutually exclusive, if one is true, then the other must be false.\n\nStep 3: Consider the negation of Statement 1\n\nThe negation of Statement 1 is \"the keys must be dangling in the cabinet,\" which is the second alternative in Statement 2.\n\nStep 4: Determine if Statement 2 allows for the truth of Statement 1's negation\n\nSince Statement 2 consists of mutually exclusive alternatives, and one alternative (Statement 1's negation) is given as true, it follows that the other alternative must be false. Therefore, \"the keys are not in the drawer\" cannot be true, which means \"the keys are in the drawer\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
