Let's break it down:\n\nStatement 3: Fido is inside.\nStatement 4: Fido must be in the garden.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the given statements contradict each other\n\nStatement 1 and Statement 3 do not contradict each other because they address different possibilities. Statement 1 states that it's not necessary for Fido to be in the garden, while Statement 3 asserts that Fido is indeed inside.\n\nStep 4: Determine if we can infer 'Fido is inside' from the given statements\n\nSince Statement 1 and Statement 3 do not contradict each other, it is possible for both statements to be true at the same time. However, Statement 2 does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that 'Fido is inside'. The 'or' operator in Statement 2 only tells us that one of the two possibilities must be true; it doesn't necessarily mean that 'Fido is inside' can be inferred from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No.",
