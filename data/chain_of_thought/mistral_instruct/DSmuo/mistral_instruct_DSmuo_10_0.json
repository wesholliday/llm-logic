This means that there are other possible locations for the missing sock.\n\nStatement 2 gives us two possibilities for where the missing sock could be: in the laundry basket or under the bed.\n\nStep 3: Now let's consider both statements together. Since Statement 1 tells us that the missing sock is not necessarily under the bed, it does not contradict Statement 2 when it says that the missing sock could also be in the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that 'The missing sock is in the laundry basket' with certainty. However, we can say that there is a possibility that the missing sock is in the laundry basket according to Statement 2.\n\nAnswer: no (we cannot infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket for sure).",
