Therefore, it cannot be true that \"it must be resting on the table\" as stated in the second condition.\n\nStep 5: Since one of the conditions in the second statement is false, the entire statement is false.\n\nStep 6: Given that the second statement is false, we cannot infer anything definitive from it.\n\nAnswer: No.",
