This means that if one condition is not true, then the other must be true.\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of each statement\n\nStatement 1 states that the toy is not required to be on the bookshelf. However, it does not exclude the possibility that the toy could still be on the bookshelf. It only means that it's not a requirement for the toy to be there.\n\nStep 4: Apply logical reasoning based on the given statements\n\nSince Statement 1 does not rule out the possibility of the toy being on the bookshelf, we cannot directly infer that the toy is in the toy box from Statement 1 alone. However, if we look at both statements together, we can use the principle of excluded middle to make an inference. Since Statement 2 tells us that either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf, and Statement 1 tells us that it's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf, we can infer that the toy must be in the toy box based on the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nStep 5: Provide the final answer\n\nAnswer: yes.",
