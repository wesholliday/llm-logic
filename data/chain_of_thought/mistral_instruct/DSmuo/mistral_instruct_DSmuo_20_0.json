In this case, the alternatives are \"the sunglasses are in her bag\" and \"they must be perched on her head.\"\n\nStep 3: Use logical reasoning to determine if we can infer 'The sunglasses are in her bag' from the given statements\n\nIf it's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head, then they could be in her bag. However, just because they could be in her bag doesn't mean that they definitely are. The statement 'Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head' only tells us that one of these two things is true, it does not necessarily mean that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements alone, we cannot infer 'The sunglasses are in her bag'.\n\nAnswer: no.",
