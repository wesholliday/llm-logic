This means that at least one of the two conditions must be true. Since Statement 1 tells us that it's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge, this implies that the milk cannot be chilling in the fridge according to Statement 1. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the milk must be on the counter based on Statement 2.\n\nStep 3: Conclude and provide the final answer\n\nAnswer: yes",
