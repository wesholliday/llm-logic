Let's break it down:\n\n1) The cat is napping on the couch\n2) It must be playing in the bedroom\n\nStep 3: Determine if the given statements contradict each other or not\n\nStatement 1 and Statement 1 from Statement 2 are negations of each other. That means, they cannot both be true at the same time. However, Statement 1 and Statement 2 from Statement 2 are not directly related to each other.\n\nStep 4: Use the process of elimination to find the answer\n\nSince Statement 1 contradicts Statement 1 from Statement 2, we can eliminate the possibility that both statements are true. Therefore, neither Statement 1 nor Statement 2 from Statement 2 can be true when Statement 1 is given as a fact. This leaves us with only one option: Statement 1 from Statement 2 must be false, which means the cat cannot be napping on the couch based on the given information.\n\nStep 5: Provide the final answer\n\nAnswer: no. The given statements do not allow us to infer that 'The cat is napping on the couch'.",
