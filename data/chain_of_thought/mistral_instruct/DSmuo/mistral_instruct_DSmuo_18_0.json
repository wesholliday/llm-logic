We know that \"it's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n2. We also know that \"either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n3. However, the second statement does not necessarily mean that if the notebook is not on the nightstand, then it must be in the drawer. It only means that those are the two possible locations for the notebook.\n4. Therefore, even though it's not on the nightstand, it could still be somewhere else entirely, such as in a different room or in a briefcase or bag.\n5. Without further information, we cannot definitively say that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: No.",
