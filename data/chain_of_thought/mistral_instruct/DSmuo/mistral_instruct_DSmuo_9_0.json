However, the 'or' in this statement does not exclude the possibility that the missing piece is actually in the box.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that the missing puzzle piece is not in the box. We can only say that it is not lost on the floor.\n\nStep 5: To answer the question, we need to determine if we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box based on the given statements. Since the second statement does not exclude this possibility and the first statement does not definitively prove otherwise, we cannot make such a conclusion with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no.",
