However, Statement 2 introduces a third possibility - the fribble might not be crinked at all. This contradicts Statement 1, as it implies that there is another possible state for the fribble besides being crinked or snurgled.\n\nStep 3: Determine if we can infer 'The fribble is snurgled' based on the given statements.\n\nNo, we cannot infer 'The fribble is snurgled' from the given statements because they are inconsistent with each other. Answer: no.",
