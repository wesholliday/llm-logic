If 'The fleeg must be surned' is true, then 'The fleeg is bluttered' is also true (from the first statement).\n2. If 'The fleeg might not be surned' is true and 'The fleeg is surned', then 'The fleeg is not bluttered'.\n3. However, if 'The fleeg might not be surned' is true and 'The fleeg is not surned', then we cannot determine whether 'The fleeg is bluttered' or not based on the given information alone.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The fleeg is bluttered' with certainty from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no.",
