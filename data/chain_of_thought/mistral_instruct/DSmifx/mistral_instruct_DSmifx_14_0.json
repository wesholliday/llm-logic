The first statement states that if the clug is not snugged, then it must be fleeked. However, this does not mean that if the clug is not snugged, it definitely is fleeked; it only means that if it's not snugged, then it cannot be snugged and must therefore be in the fleeked state.\n2. The second statement only indicates a possibility that the clug might not be snugged, but it does not provide enough information to determine whether or not the clug is actually fleeked.\n\nStep 3: Conclusion\n\nAnswer: No.",
