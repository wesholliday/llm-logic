(This statement implies that if the flugel is not zargled, then it must be blimmed.)\n- Statement 2: The flugel might not be zargled. (This statement suggests that there's a possibility that the flugel is not zargled.)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given statements to determine if 'The flugel is blimmed' can be inferred.\n\nSince Statement 1 states that either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed, and Statement 2 suggests that there's a possibility that the flugel is not zargled, it is impossible to infer definitively that 'The flugel is blimmed'. The statements do not provide enough information to make such a conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No.",
