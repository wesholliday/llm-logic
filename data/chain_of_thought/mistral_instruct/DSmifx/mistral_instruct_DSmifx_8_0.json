However, Statement 2 introduces a third possibility - the sprocket might not be daggled but its state is not specified as being cranked.\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of each possibility\n\nIf the sprocket is daggled, then according to Statement 1, it cannot also be cranked. Therefore, if we know that the sprocket is daggled, we can infer that it is not cranked.\n\nIf the sprocket is cranked, then again, according to Statement 1, it cannot be daggled. Therefore, if we know that the sprocket is cranked, we can infer that it is not daggled.\n\nHowever, Statement 2 tells us that the sprocket might not be daggled. This means that there is a possibility that the sprocket is neither daggled nor cranked. Since Statement 1 does not allow for this third possibility, we cannot infer 'The sprocket is cranked' based on the given statements.\n\nStep 4: Provide the answer\n\nAnswer: no.",
