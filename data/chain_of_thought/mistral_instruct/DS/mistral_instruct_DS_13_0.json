We have two statements: 'Either the toy is in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf', and 'The toy isn't sitting on the shelf'.\n2. The first statement tells us that the toy can only be in one of two places: either in the toy box or on the shelf.\n3. The second statement tells us that the toy is not on the shelf.\n4. Since the toy cannot be both in the toy box and on the shelf at the same time, and we know it's not on the shelf, then the only possible conclusion is that the toy must be in the toy box.\n5. Therefore, 'The toy is in the toy box'.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
