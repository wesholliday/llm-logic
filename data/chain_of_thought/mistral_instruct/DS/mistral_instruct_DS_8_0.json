We have two statements: 'Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch' and 'The remote control isn't hiding under the couch'.\n2. The first statement tells us that the remote control can be in one of two places: either on the coffee table or hidden under the couch.\n3. The second statement tells us that the remote control is not hidden under the couch.\n4. Since the remote control cannot be both on the coffee table and hidden under the couch at the same time, and we know it's not hidden under the couch, then the only possible location for the remote control is on the coffee table.\n5. Therefore, 'The remote control is on the coffee table' is a valid conclusion based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
