We have two statements: 'Either the keys are in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet' and 'The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet'.\n2. The first statement tells us that the keys can be either in the drawer or dangling in the cabinet, but it doesn't exclude the possibility of them being in the drawer.\n3. The second statement informs us that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet.\n4. Since the keys cannot be dangling in the cabinet according to the second statement, this means they must be in some other location, such as the drawer (as per the first statement).\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The keys are in the drawer'.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
