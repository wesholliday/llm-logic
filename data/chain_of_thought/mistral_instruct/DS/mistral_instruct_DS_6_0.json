We have two statements: \"Either the phone is in the living room or it is ringing in the kitchen\" and \"The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen.\"\n2. The first statement tells us that if the phone is not in the living room, then it must be ringing in the kitchen. However, the second statement tells us that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen.\n3. Since we know that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen, according to the first statement, it should be in the living room.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer 'The phone is in the living room'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
