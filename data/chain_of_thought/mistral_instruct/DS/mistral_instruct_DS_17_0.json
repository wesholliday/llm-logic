The first statement \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it is draped on the coat rack\" gives us two possibilities for the location of the scarf. The second statement \"The scarf isn't draped on the coat rack\" eliminates one of those possibilities, leaving only the possibility that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack. Therefore, based on this information, we can infer 'Answer: yes, the scarf is stuffed in the backpack'.",
