It tells us that the milk can be in one of two places - either on the counter or in the fridge.\n\nStep 3: Now let's consider Statement 2. It states that the milk is not chilling in the fridge. This means that the milk cannot be in the fridge.\n\nStep 4: Since we know that the milk cannot be in the fridge (from Statement 2), and we also know that it can only be on the counter or in the fridge (from Statement 1), then the only logical conclusion is that the milk must be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
