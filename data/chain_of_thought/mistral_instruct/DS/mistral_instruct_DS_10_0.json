This is a disjunction, meaning it can be true if either part is true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the missing sock is not under the bed.\n\nStep 3: Let's consider the possibilities.\n\nIf Statement 1 were true and Statement 2 false, then the missing sock would be in the laundry basket and it would also be under the bed (which we know is false). This creates a contradiction.\n\nHowever, if Statement 1 were true and Statement 2 true, then the missing sock would be in the laundry basket and not under the bed, which is consistent with both statements.\n\nStep 4: Based on our analysis, we can conclude that...\n\nAnswer: Yes, given the information provided, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.",
