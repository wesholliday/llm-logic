It states that the cookies could be either in the jar or hidden in the pantry. This means that there are two possible locations for the cookies.\n\nStep 3: Now let's consider Statement 2. It states that the cookies aren't hidden in the pantry. This means that the second possibility (cookies being hidden in the pantry) is not true.\n\nStep 4: Since Statement 1 tells us that there are only two possibilities for the location of the cookies, and Statement 2 eliminates one of those possibilities, it follows logically that the remaining possibility must be true.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, the answer is 'Answer: yes' - The cookies are in the jar.",
