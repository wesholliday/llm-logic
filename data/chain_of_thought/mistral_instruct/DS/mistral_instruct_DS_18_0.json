We start with the given information: \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand.\" This statement tells us that the notebook can be in one of two places - either in the drawer or on the nightstand.\n2. The next piece of information given is \"The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand.\" This statement tells us that the notebook is not in the second possible location mentioned earlier, which is the nightstand.\n3. Since we know that the notebook cannot be on the nightstand, and we also know that it can only be in one of two places (either in the drawer or on the nightstand), then the only logical conclusion is that the notebook must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
