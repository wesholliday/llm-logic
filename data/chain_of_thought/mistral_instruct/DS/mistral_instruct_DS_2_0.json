We have two statements: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table\" and \"The book isn't resting on the table.\"\n2. The first statement tells us that the book can be in one of two places: either on the shelf or on the table. It does not exclude the possibility of the book being on the shelf.\n3. The second statement informs us that the book is not resting on the table. However, it does not provide any information about where the book might be.\n4. Since we know that the book cannot be on the table based on the second statement, and we also know from the first statement that the book could be on the shelf, then the only logical conclusion is that the book must be on the shelf.\n5. Answer: yes.",
