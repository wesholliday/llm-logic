It tells us that Fido can be either inside or in the garden, but it doesn't exclude the possibility of him being inside.\n\nStep 3: Now let's consider Statement 2. It states that Fido is not in the garden. This means that Fido cannot be in the garden according to this statement.\n\nStep 4: Since Statement 1 does not definitively state that Fido is not inside, and Statement 2 only tells us that Fido is not in the garden, we cannot infer for certain that Fido is inside based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
