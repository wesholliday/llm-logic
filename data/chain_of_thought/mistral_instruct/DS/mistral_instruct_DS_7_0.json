We have two statements: \"Either the umbrella is in the car or it is tucked away in the closet\" and \"The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet.\"\n2. The first statement tells us that the umbrella can be either in the car or in the closet, but not both at the same time.\n3. The second statement tells us that the umbrella is not in the closet.\n4. To determine if we can infer that the umbrella is in the car based on these two statements, let's consider the possibilities:\n   a) If the umbrella were in the closet, then it would not be true that \"The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet.\" Since we know that statement is true, the umbrella cannot be in the closet.\n   b) Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the umbrella is in the car.\n5. So, based on the given statements, we can infer that 'The umbrella is in the car'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
