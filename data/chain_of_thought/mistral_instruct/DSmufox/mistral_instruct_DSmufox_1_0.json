We have two statements: \"It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled\" and \"Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed.\"\n2. The first statement means that the flugel does not have to be zargled, but it could still be blimmed.\n3. The second statement gives us two possibilities: either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed.\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the flugel does not have to be zargled, it follows that the second possibility (the flugel being blimmed) must be true.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that \"The flugel is blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes.",
