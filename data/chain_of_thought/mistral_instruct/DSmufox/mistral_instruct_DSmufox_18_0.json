This means that at least one of the two conditions must be true. However, Statement 1 tells us that the first condition, \"the shank must be nugged,\" is not true.\n\nStep 3: Determine if we can infer 'The shank is plooked' from the given statements\n\nSince Statement 1 tells us that it's not the case that the shank must be nugged, and Statement 2 states that either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked, it follows that the second condition, \"it is plooked,\" must be true. Therefore, we can infer 'The shank is plooked'.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
