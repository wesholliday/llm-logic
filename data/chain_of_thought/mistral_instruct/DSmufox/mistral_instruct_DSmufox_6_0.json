This means that at least one of the two conditions must be true. However, Statement 1 tells us that the first condition, \"the grommet must be plopped,\" is not the case.\n\nStep 3: Determine if we can infer 'The grommet is sploffed' from the given statements\n\nSince Statement 1 negates the first part of the disjunction in Statement 2, it does not directly allow us to conclude that 'The grommet is sploffed'. However, it does mean that the grommet cannot be plopped. The second part of the disjunction, \"it is sploffed,\" could still be true.\n\nStep 4: Final answer\n\nAnswer: no.",
