It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled. This means that it is possible for the zinger not to be smoogled.\n2. Either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled. This statement sets up two mutually exclusive possibilities: either the zinger must be smoogled, or it is fraggled.\n\nNow let's consider what we can infer from these statements:\n\nSince \"It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled\" tells us that it's possible for the zinger not to be smoogled, and since \"Either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled\" sets up two mutually exclusive possibilities, we cannot infer that \"The zinger is fraggled\" based on these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
