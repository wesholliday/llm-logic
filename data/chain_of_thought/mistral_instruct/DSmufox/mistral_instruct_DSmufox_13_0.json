The first statement tells us that it's not necessary for the glip to be traged.\n2. The second statement gives us two possibilities: the glip must be traged or it must be slogged.\n3. Since we know from the first statement that it's not necessary for the glip to be traged, it follows that the second alternative in the second statement must be true.\n4. Therefore, \"The glip is slogged\" is a valid conclusion based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
