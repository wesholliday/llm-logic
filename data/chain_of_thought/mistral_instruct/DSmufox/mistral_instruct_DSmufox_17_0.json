We have two statements: \"It's not the case that the flob must be movated\" and \"Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled.\"\n2. The first statement means that there is no necessity for the flob to be moved.\n3. The second statement presents a disjunction, which means that either one of the two alternatives must be true: the flob must be moved or it is skizzled.\n4. Since we know that the flob does not have to be moved according to the first statement, this leaves us with the alternative that \"it is skizzled.\"\n5. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The flob is skizzled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
