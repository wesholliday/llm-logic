It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked. This statement means that crinking the fribble is not a requirement or necessity.\n2. Either the fribble must be crinked or it is snurgled. This statement presents two alternatives, but it does not necessarily mean that both conditions must be true at the same time. It could also mean that one or the other is true, but not both.\n\nGiven this information, we cannot infer that \"The fribble is snurgled\" based on the given statements alone. The fact that crinking the fribble is not required does not necessarily mean that it must be snurgled instead. There could be other possibilities as well.\n\nAnswer: no.",
