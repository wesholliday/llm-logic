It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged. This means that there is at least one possible state for the smonk other than being plagged.\n2. Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled. This statement sets up two mutually exclusive possibilities for the smonk's state.\n\nSince the first statement tells us that the smonk can be in a state other than plagged, and the second statement presents plagged and vreebled as the only possible states for the smonk, it seems that we cannot directly infer \"The smonk is vreebled\" from these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
