Now, let's examine Statement 2. This statement asserts that \"either the wug must be garpled or it is sproinged.\"\n\nStep 3: Consider the possibilities based on the given statements\n\nSince we know that there is at least one situation where the wug is not garpled (from Statement 1), this means that in that situation, the wug must be \"sproinged\" according to Statement 2. Therefore, if the wug is not garpled, it must be sproinged.\n\nStep 4: Determine the answer based on the given statements\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer 'The wug is sproinged' under certain conditions (when it is not garpled).",
