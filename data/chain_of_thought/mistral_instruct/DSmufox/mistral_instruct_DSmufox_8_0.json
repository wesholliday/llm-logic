However, Statement 1 tells us that it's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled. This means that the sprocket can indeed be cranked, as stated in Statement 2.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis\n\nSince we have determined that the sprocket can be cranked based on Statement 1 and Statement 2, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes, the sprocket can be cranked.",
