However, Statement 1 contradicts the first part of Statement 2 by stating that the snow does not need to be sprouted.\n\nStep 3: Determine if we can infer 'The snow is crampled' from the given statements\n\nSince Statement 1 contradicts the first part of Statement 2, it follows that Statement 1 cannot be true if Statement 2 is true in its entirety. Therefore, Statement 2 must be true with its second part being the case: 'The snow is crampled'.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
