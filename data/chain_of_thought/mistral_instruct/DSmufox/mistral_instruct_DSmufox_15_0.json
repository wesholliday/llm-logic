Let's examine each disjunct:\n\nDisjunct 1: The dreb must be spent.\nDisjunct 2: It is vroombed.\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the contradictory statement\n\nSince Statement 1 states that it's not the case that the dreb must be spent, Disjunct 1 cannot be true. Therefore, we can eliminate this disjunct as a possibility.\n\nStep 5: Conclude based on remaining disjunct\n\nThe only remaining disjunct is Disjunct 2: It is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
