We have two statements: \"It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed\" and \"Either the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed.\"\n2. The first statement means that the flug does not have to be zimmed, but it could still be blummed if that's an option.\n3. The second statement gives us two possibilities: either the flug must be zimmed, or it can be blummed instead.\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the flug does not have to be zimmed, this means that the second possibility in the second statement must be true: \"it is blummed.\"\n5. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The flug is blummed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
