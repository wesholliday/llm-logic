Here are the steps:\n\n1. We know that 'It's not the case that the splat must be quanked'. This means that there is at least one scenario where the splat is not quanked.\n2. We also know that 'Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed'. This statement sets up two mutually exclusive possibilities for the splat: either it must be quanked, or it is morphed.\n3. Since we already know that there is a scenario where the splat is not quanked, this means that the first part of the disjunction ('the splat must be quanked') cannot be true in all cases. Therefore, the second part of the disjunction ('it is morphed') must be true in at least one scenario.\n4. However, we cannot directly infer that 'The splat is morphed' is true in all cases based on these two statements alone. It only means that there is at least one scenario where the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: no.",
