Since Statement 1 tells us that it's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked, this means that the whiffle cannot always be tinked and must sometimes be shanked according to Statement 2.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis\n\nAnswer: yes. The statements allow us to infer that the whiffle is shanked at least some of the time.",
