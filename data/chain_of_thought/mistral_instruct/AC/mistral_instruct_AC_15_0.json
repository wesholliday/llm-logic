We have two statements: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" and \"Erin took a train.\"\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement, meaning it sets up a relationship between two events: If event A (Sam taking a plane) occurs, then event B (Erin taking a train) also occurs.\n3. The second statement tells us that event B (Erin taking a train) has already happened.\n4. However, the first statement does not guarantee that event A (Sam taking a plane) has occurred; it only states that if event A happens, then event B follows.\n5. Therefore, even though we know Erin took a train, we cannot infer for certain that Sam took a plane based on this information alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
