This is a conditional statement with an 'if-then' relationship. It does not directly tell us what the doll actually is made of. The second statement tells us that the truck is made of metal.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possibilities\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot infer for certain that the doll is plastic. The only thing we know for sure is that the truck is metal. The first statement does not allow us to make a definitive conclusion about the doll's material based on the information provided.\n\nStep 4: Conclude\n\nAnswer: no.",
