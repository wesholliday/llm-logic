The first statement, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" is a conditional statement that can be read as \"Sue was at the wedding if Mary was.\" When we add the second statement, \"Sue was at the wedding,\" we have two pieces of information that together satisfy the condition stated in the first. Therefore, it follows logically that Mary was also at the wedding.",
