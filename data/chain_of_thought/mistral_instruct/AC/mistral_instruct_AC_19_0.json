We have two conditional statements: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" and \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n2. The first statement is an if-then statement, which means that when the condition (Tom watching football) is true, the consequence (Jen watching basketball) must also be true.\n3. The second statement tells us that Jen did indeed watch basketball.\n4. However, it does not necessarily mean that Tom watched football. The first statement only establishes a relationship between Tom's football watching and Jen's basketball watching. It doesn't guarantee that Tom actually watched football.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"Tom watched football.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
