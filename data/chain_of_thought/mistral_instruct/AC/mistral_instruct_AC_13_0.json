It only states that the truck is blue. The first statement establishes a conditional relationship between the colors of the car and the truck. However, it doesn't guarantee that the car actually has the stated color when the truck is blue.\n\nStep 3: Consider possible scenarios\n\n1) Scenario where the car is red and the truck is blue: In this case, both statements are true.\n2) Scenario where the car is not red but has some other color and the truck is blue: In this case, the first statement is false, but the second statement is still true.\n\nStep 4: Determine if we can infer 'The car was red' based on the given statements\n\nSince the second statement does not provide any information about the color of the car, and the first statement only establishes a conditional relationship between the colors of the car and the truck without guaranteeing that the car has the stated color when the truck is blue, we cannot infer 'The car was red' based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no.",
