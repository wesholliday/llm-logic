It states that if Sue chooses pizza, then Bob chooses pasta.\n2. \"Bob chose pasta\": This statement is a factual statement, indicating that Bob did indeed choose pasta.\n3. To infer that \"Sue chose pizza\" from these statements, we would need to apply the principle of contrapositive in logic. The contrapositive of \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\" However, this statement is not given as a fact.\n4. Since we don't have enough information to apply the principle of contrapositive, we cannot infer that \"Sue chose pizza\" based on the given statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
