            "content": " To infer that \"The book was written by James,\" we need to apply the rules of logic to the given statements. The first statement is \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This is an conditional statement or an implication. The second statement is \"The book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nTo determine if we can infer that \"The book was written by James\" from these two statements, we need to apply the rule of Modus Ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (if p then q) and we know that p is true, then we can infer that q is true.\n\nSo, in this case, we have:\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel (p -> q)\n2. The book is a mystery novel (q)\n\nTo apply Modus Ponens, we need to show that p is true. In other words, we need to have evidence or proof that the book was indeed written by James. If we do not have this information, then we cannot infer that \"The book was written by James\" based on these two statements alone.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: no.",
