If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest (implication)\n2. The unicorn was in the forest\n\nFirst, we need to understand what an implication is and how it works. An implication is a logical statement that says if A is true, then B must be true. In this case, \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" is an implication.\n\nNow let's consider the given statements:\n1. We have been told that if a griffin is in the forest, then a unicorn must also be present (implication).\n2. We have been informed that a unicorn is indeed in the forest.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that \"The griffin was in the forest,\" let's apply the rules of logical implications:\n1. If A implies B and B is true, then A must be true.\n\nIn this case, A is \"the griffin is in the forest\" and B is \"the unicorn is in the forest.\" Since we know that B is true (given statement), we can infer that A must also be true based on the implication.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
