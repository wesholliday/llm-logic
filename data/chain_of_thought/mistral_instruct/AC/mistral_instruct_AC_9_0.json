However, it does not necessarily mean that Lisa actually bought the red shirt; it only establishes a relationship between her potential purchase and Mark's purchase.\n\n2. \"Mark bought the blue shirt\": This statement is an unconditional fact, meaning that Mark indeed purchased the blue shirt.\n\nNow let's consider if we can infer that Lisa bought the red shirt based on these two statements:\n\nTo make this inference, we would need to know that Lisa did buy the red shirt (an unconditional fact). The given information only tells us that if she had bought the red shirt, then Mark would have bought the blue shirt. It does not guarantee that she actually purchased the red shirt. Therefore, based on the provided statements, we cannot infer that \"Lisa bought the red shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: no.",
