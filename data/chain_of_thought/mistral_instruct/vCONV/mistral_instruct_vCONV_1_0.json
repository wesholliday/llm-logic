            "content": " To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to apply the rules of logic to its premise and conclusion. The argument can be represented as follows using conditional statements:\n\nIf Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (Premise)\nIf Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding (Conclusion)\n\nThis type of argument is known as a contrapositive argument. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P then Q\" is \"If not Q then not P\". To check if the given argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise.\n\nLet's analyze the given argument:\n\nPremise: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\nContrapositive of Premise: If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\n\nConclusion: If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\n\nTo check if the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, we need to negate both the premise and the conclusion and see if they are equivalent.\n\nNegated Premise: If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\nNegated Conclusion: If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\n\nSince the negated premise and the negated conclusion are identical, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
