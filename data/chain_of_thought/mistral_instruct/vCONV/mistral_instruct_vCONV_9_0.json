The argument can be represented as follows using conditional statements:\n\nIf Lisa bought the red shirt (P), then Mark bought the blue shirt (Q)\nIf Mark bought the blue shirt (Q), then Lisa bought the red shirt (P)\n\nThe given argument is not logically valid because it violates the principle of contrapositive, which states that if two conditional statements are equivalent, then their contrapositives must also be equivalent. In this case, the premise and conclusion have different contrapositives:\n\nContrapositive of 'If Lisa bought the red shirt (P), then Mark bought the blue shirt (Q)' is 'If Mark did not buy the blue shirt (not Q), then Lisa did not buy the red shirt (not P)'.\n\nContrapositive of 'If Mark bought the blue shirt (Q), then Lisa bought the red shirt (P)' is 'If Lisa did not buy the red shirt (not P), then Mark did not buy the blue shirt (not Q)'.\n\nSince the contrapositives are not equivalent, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no.",
