            "content": " To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to apply the rules of logic to its premise and conclusion. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (Premise)\n2. If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion follows necessarily from its premises. In other words, if it is not possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.\n\nTo test this, let's consider a hypothetical scenario where both the vampire and mummy are awake:\n\n1. The vampire is awake (From Premise 1, assuming the antecedent is true)\n2. Therefore, the mummy is awake (From Premise 1)\n3. And since the mummy is awake, the vampire is awake (From Conclusion)\n\nIn this scenario, both premises and the conclusion are true. This means that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
