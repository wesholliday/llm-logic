            "content": " To determine the logical validity of the argument, we need to apply the rules of logic to its given premise and conclusion. The argument is in the form of a conditional statement, also known as a material implication.\n\nFirst, let's examine the premise 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball'. This statement implies that whenever Tom watches football, Jen watches basketball. In other words, the occurrence of Tom watching football logically leads to the occurrence of Jen watching basketball.\n\nNow, we want to derive a conditional statement with Jen's basketball-watching as the antecedent and Tom's football-watching as the consequent. To do this, we need to apply the rule of contrapositive, which states that if 'p implies q', then 'not q implies not p'.\n\nApplying the rule of contrapositive to our premise:\n\n1. If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball (original premise)\n2. Not Jen watched basketball => Not Tom watched football (contrapositive)\n\nNow we have our conclusion in the form of a conditional statement: 'If not Jen watched basketball, then not Tom watched football'.\n\nTo check if this is logically equivalent to the original conclusion 'If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football', we need to apply the rule of double negation. This rule states that 'not not p' is logically equivalent to 'p'.\n\nApplying the rule of double negation to our derived conclusion:\n\n1. If not Jen watched basketball, then not Tom watched football (derived conclusion)\n2. Not (not Jen watched basketball) => Not (not Tom watched football) (double negation)\n3. Jen watched basketball => Tom watched football (negating both sides twice)\n\nSince the derived conclusion 'Jen watched basketball => Tom watched football' is logically equivalent to the original conclusion, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
