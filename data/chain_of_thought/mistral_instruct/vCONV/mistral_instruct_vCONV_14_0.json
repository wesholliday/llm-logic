            "content": " To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to apply the rules of logic to its premise and conclusion. The argument can be represented as follows using conditional statements:\n\nIf A (bear in case), then B (wolf in den)\nIf B, then A\n\nThe first step is to check if the premises logically imply the conclusion. To do this, we need to apply the rules of logic for the material implication (if-then statement). Specifically, we will use the contrapositive rule:\n\nIf A implies B, then it is also true that not-B implies not-A.\n\nLet's check if the given argument follows this rule:\n\n1. If A (bear in case), then B (wolf in den)\n2. If B (wolf in den), then A (bear in case)\n\nTo apply the contrapositive rule, we need to negate both premises and conclusion:\n\n1'. If not-B (not wolf in den), then not-A (not bear in case)\n2'. If not-A (not bear in case), then not-B (not wolf in den)\n\nNow let's compare the negated premises and conclusion:\n\n1'. If not-B, then not-A\n2'. If not-A, then not-B\n\nSince both statements are identical, it means that the given argument follows the contrapositive rule. Therefore, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
