            "content": " To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to apply the rules of logic to its premises and conclusion. The argument can be represented as follows using conditional statements:\n\nIf (p) [the book was written by James], then (q) [the book is a mystery novel]\nIf (q) [the book is a mystery novel], then (p) [the book was written by James]\n\nThis form of argument is called the contrapositive, which is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement. Therefore, if the forward implication (if p then q) is true, then its contrapositive (if not q then not p) must also be true for logical consistency.\n\nTo check the validity of the argument, we need to verify that both premises are indeed true. However, since only one premise has been provided, it's impossible to determine the truth value of this argument based on the given information alone.\n\nTherefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer without knowing whether the first premise 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' is true or false.\n\nAnswer: Undetermined.",
