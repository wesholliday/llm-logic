If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race (Premise)\n2. If Chris finished the face, then Alex finished the race (Conclusion)\n\nThe given argument is not logically valid because the second premise is incorrect. The conclusion does not follow logically from the premise. In order for the argument to be valid, we would need:\n\n1. If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race (Premise)\n2. If Alex finished the race, then Alex finished the race (Valid implication)\n3. If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race (From Premise 1)\n4. Therefore, if Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race (Valid contrapositive)\n\nHowever, since the second premise in the original argument is incorrect, the conclusion does not follow logically from it.\n\nAnswer: No.",
