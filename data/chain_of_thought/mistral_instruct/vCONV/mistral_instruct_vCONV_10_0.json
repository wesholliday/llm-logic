If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. (Premise)\n2. If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside. (Conclusion)\n\nThe given argument is not logically valid because it violates the principle of contrapositive in logic. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. In this case, the premise and conclusion have opposite directions, so they cannot both be true unless by coincidence.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no.",
