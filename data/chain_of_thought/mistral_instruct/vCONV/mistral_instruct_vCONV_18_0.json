If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. (Premise)\n2. If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic. (Conclusion)\n\nThe given argument is not logically valid because it violates the principle of contrapositive in logic. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. In order for an argument to be valid, the conclusion must follow logically from its premises, and this includes the contrapositives of those statements.\n\nIn this case, the given argument does not satisfy this condition because the contrapositive of the premise is 'If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic', while the conclusion states 'If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic'. These two statements are contradictory, so the argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: no.",
