However, it does not specify anything about the time of submission.\n\nTo infer 'If the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A', we need to determine if being late is also a sufficient condition for getting an A. Without additional information, we cannot make that assumption. Therefore, based on the given statement alone, we cannot infer that 'If the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A'.\n\nAnswer: no.",
