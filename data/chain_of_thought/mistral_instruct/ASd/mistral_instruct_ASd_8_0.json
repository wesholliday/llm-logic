It does not mention anything about misrouting or delays. The new statement introduces an additional condition (misrouting) to the original statement, which was not present in the given statement.\n\nStep 4: Consider the impact of misrouting on arrival time.\n\nMisrouting can cause delays in delivery, as the package may need to be redirected to its correct destination. In some cases, these delays could result in the package arriving later than expected. However, it is also possible for a misrouted package to still arrive on the same day if the error is identified and corrected quickly enough.\n\nStep 5: Make a decision based on available information.\n\nGiven that the new statement introduces an additional condition (misrouting) not present in the original statement, it is not safe to infer that 'If the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today' based on the given statement alone. The arrival time could be affected by the misrouting, making it uncertain whether the package would still arrive on that day.\n\nAnswer: No.",
