Charging the phone under these circumstances would still involve providing an external power source to transfer electrical energy into the battery.\n\nStep 3: Consider if the given statement applies to this new condition.\n\nThe given statement \"If I charge my phone, it will have power\" does not explicitly state that the phone must already have power for the charging process to work. Therefore, as long as we can provide an external power source to charge the dead battery, the statement remains true.\n\nStep 4: Formulate the final answer.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
