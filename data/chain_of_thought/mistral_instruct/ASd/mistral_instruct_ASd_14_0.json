The second statement \"If I study hard and the test is in Chinese\" introduces an additional condition of the test being in Chinese.\n\nTo infer that \"If I study hard and the test is in Chinese, I will pass the test,\" we would need to make some assumptions or have information indicating that my proficiency in Chinese does not significantly impact my ability to pass the test, given that I study hard. If this assumption holds true, then yes, we can infer that \"If I study hard and the test is in Chinese, I will pass the test.\"\n\nHowever, if there's a possibility that my language proficiency in Chinese could negatively impact my performance on the test despite studying hard, then no, we cannot make such an assumption without further information.\n\nAnswer: It depends.",
