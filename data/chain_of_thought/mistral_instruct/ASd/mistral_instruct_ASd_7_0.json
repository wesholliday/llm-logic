If the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm. (Given statement)\n2. If the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm. (New condition)\n\nStep 4: Consider each component separately\n\nComponent 1: \"If the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm.\" This is the given statement, which we know to be true based on the information provided.\n\nComponent 2: \"If the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm.\"\n\nStep 5: Determine if the new condition follows logically from the given statement\n\nTo determine this, let's consider what it means for the oven to be \"on\" in each situation. In the first component, \"the oven is on,\" implies that the oven is functioning properly and heating up the kitchen. However, in the second component, \"the oven is on and the pilot light is out,\" means that the oven may not be functioning properly or efficiently since the pilot light is responsible for igniting the gas burner. Therefore, it's possible that the kitchen might not be as warm under these conditions.\n\nStep 6: Conclusion\n\nBased on the given statement and the new condition, we cannot infer that \"If the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm.\" There is a possibility that the kitchen may not be warm under those circumstances.\n\nAnswer: no.",
