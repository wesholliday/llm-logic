In the given statement, the match will light if struck, but in the new condition, the match will not light even if struck due to being soaked in water.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis above, we cannot infer that \"If the match is struck and it has been soaked in water, then it will light.\" Instead, the answer is 'Answer: no'.",
