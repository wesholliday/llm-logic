However, during a drought, even with proper fertilization, the lack of water can still hinder the lawn's ability to be lush and green.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the inference\n\nThe inference is \"If I fertilize the lawn and there is a drought, it will be lush and green.\" This statement assumes that even with a drought, the lawn will still be lush and green if it is fertilized. However, as discussed earlier, while fertilizing can make the grass healthier, it cannot overcome the negative effects of a drought on its appearance.\n\nStep 5: Provide the answer\n\nAnswer: No.",
