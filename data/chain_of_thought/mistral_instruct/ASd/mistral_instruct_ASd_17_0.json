However, it does not guarantee that the car will run perfectly or without any other issues.\n\nStep 3: Understand the new statement we want to infer\n\nThe new statement we want to infer is \"If I change the oil and the transmission is shot, the car will run smoothly.\" This statement suggests that even if the transmission is damaged, changing the oil will still result in a smooth-running car.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the relationship between the given statement and the new statement\n\nThe given statement does not directly address the condition of the transmission or any other parts of the car besides the engine. Changing the oil may improve the engine's performance, but it does not necessarily fix issues with other components like the transmission. Therefore, we cannot infer that changing the oil alone will make a car run smoothly if the transmission is shot.\n\nStep 5: Conclusion and answer\n\nAnswer: No.",
