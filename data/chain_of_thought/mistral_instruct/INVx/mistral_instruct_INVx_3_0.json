If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\n\nThis statement implies that morphing the splat is a sufficient condition for it to quank. However, it does not necessarily mean that not morphing the splat is a necessary condition for it not to quank. In other words, we cannot directly infer that 'If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank' based on this statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
