If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged\n\nThis statement implies that whenever the condition (vreebling) is true, the consequence (plagging) is also true. However, it does not provide any information about what happens when the condition is false.\n\nTo infer 'If the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk was not plagged', we need to establish that whenever the condition is false, the consequence must be false as well. But based on the given statement alone, we cannot make this assumption with certainty.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: no.",
