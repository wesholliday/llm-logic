'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink': This is a conditional statement with the 'if-then' structure. It means that if the condition (grommet being sploffed) is true, then the consequence (grommet plopping the frink) must also be true.\n2. However, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true. Just because the grommet plopped the frink when it was sploffed does not mean that it will always plop the frink whenever it's in that state or even when it's not sploffed at all.\n3. To infer 'If the grommet was not sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink', we would need to have enough evidence to establish a reverse conditional statement (if-then) relationship. But since we only have information about the forward relationship, we cannot make that inference based on the given statement alone.\n4. Therefore, the answer is: Answer: no.",
