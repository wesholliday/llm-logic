'If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged': This statement is an example of a conditional statement with the \"if-then\" structure. It means that if the condition (the shank being plooked) is true, then the consequence (the shank being nugged) must also be true.\n2. 'If the shank was not plooked, then the shank was not nugged': This statement is the negation of the original conditional statement. It means that if the condition (the shank not being plooked) is true, then the consequence (the shank not being nugged) must also be true.\n3. To infer that 'If the shank was not plooked, then the shank was not nugged' from 'If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged', we would need to have a logical relationship called a contrapositive. The contrapositive of 'If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged' is 'If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked'. However, this is not what we are trying to infer.\n4. Instead, we have 'If the shank was not plooked, then the shank was not nugged', which is the negation of the original conditional statement's consequent. This is not logically equivalent to the contrapositive and does not follow directly from the original statement.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the shank was not plooked, then the shank was not nugged' from 'If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged'.\n\nAnswer: no.",
