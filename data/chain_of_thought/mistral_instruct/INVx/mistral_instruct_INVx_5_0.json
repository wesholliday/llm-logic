If the given conditional proposition is true, then its contrapositive is also true. Therefore, to determine if we can infer 'If the zinger was not fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled' from 'If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled', we need to check if the given statement and its contrapositive are both true or false.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to determine the truth value of the original conditional proposition, we cannot definitively say whether 'If the zinger was not fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled' can be inferred from it. However, based on the structure of conditional propositions and the properties of contrapositives, if the original proposition is true, then its contrapositive is also true, and we can infer 'If the zinger was not fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes (assuming the original conditional proposition is true)",
