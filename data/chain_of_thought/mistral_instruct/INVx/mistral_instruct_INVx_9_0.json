If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished (given)\n2. If it was not varnished, then it was not plinked (contrapositive)\n\nTo form the contrapositive, we swap the hypotheses and negations:\n- Not varnished \u2194 Not plinked\n- If it was not varnished, then it was not plinked\n\nNow let's compare the original statement with its contrapositive:\n\n1. If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished (given)\n2. If it was not varnished, then it was not plinked (contrapositive)\n\nSince both statements are equivalent (they mean the same thing), we can infer that 'If the twonk was not plinked, then it was not varnished' is a valid conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
