'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged': This statement is a conditional statement that can be read as \"if the clug is fleeked (has some quality), then it is snugged (has another quality)\". It does not necessarily mean that if the clug is not fleeked, it cannot be snugged.\n2. 'If the clug was not fleeked, then the clug was not snugged': This statement is also a conditional statement and can be read as \"if the clug is not fleeked (does not have some quality), then it is not snugged (does not have another quality)\".\n3. However, just because one statement implies another does not mean that the inverse of the second statement is true based on the given information alone. In this case, we cannot infer that 'If the clug was not fleeked, then the clug was not snugged' from 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged'.\n\nAnswer: no.",
