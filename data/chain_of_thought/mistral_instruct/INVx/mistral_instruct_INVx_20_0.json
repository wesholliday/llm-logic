However, without knowing the meaning of \"bluttered\" and \"surn\" or having additional context, we cannot be certain that this rule applies in this case.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to definitively answer whether we can infer \"If the fleeg was not bluttered, then it did not surn\" from \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" without more information.\n\nAnswer: no.",
