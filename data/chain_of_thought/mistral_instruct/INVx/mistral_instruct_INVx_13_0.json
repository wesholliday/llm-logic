'If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged': This statement is an implication, which means that if the condition (the glip being slogged) is true, then the consequence (the glip being tragged) must also be true. In other words, whenever the glip is slogged, it is also tragged.\n2. 'If the glip was not slogged, then the glip was not tragged': This statement is another implication, but this time stating that if the condition (the glip not being slogged) is true, then the consequence (the glip not being tragged) must also be true. In other words, whenever the glip is not slogged, it is also not tragged.\n3. To infer 'If the glip was not slogged, then the glip was not tragged' from 'If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged', we would need to apply the contrapositive rule of implication, which states that if p implies q, then the statement 'not q implies not p' is also true.\n4. However, in this case, the contrapositive of 'If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged' is 'If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged', which is different from 'If the glip was not slogged, then the glip was not tragged'.\n5. Therefore, we cannot directly infer 'If the glip was not slogged, then the glip was not tragged' from 'If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged', as they do not logically imply each other.\n\nAnswer: no.",
