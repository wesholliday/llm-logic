If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\n\nThis statement implies that whenever the fribble is snurgled, it will crink. However, it does not provide any information about what happens when the fribble is not snurgled. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that 'If the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink' based on this statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
