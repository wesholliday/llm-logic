            "content": " To answer this question, let's break down the given conditional statement \"If the snow was compacted, then the snow sprouted the frink\" and apply the rules of logic.\n\nFirst, we need to understand that a conditional statement has two parts: the hypothesis (if part) and the conclusion (then part). In this case, the hypothesis is \"the snow was compacted,\" and the conclusion is \"the snow sprouted the frink.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the negation of each part. The negation of the hypothesis would be \"the snow was not compacted,\" and the negation of the conclusion would be \"the snow did not sprout the frink.\"\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the snow was not compacted, then the snow did not sprout the frink\" from the given statement, we need to apply the rule of contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then swapping them.\n\nSo, the contrapositive of \"If the snow was compacted, then the snow sprouted the frink\" would be \"If the snow did not sprout the frink, then the snow was not compacted.\"\n\nSince we are trying to infer \"If the snow was not compacted, then the snow did not sprout the frink,\" which is the negation of the conclusion in the original statement, and we have a true contrapositive statement, we can conclude that yes, we can infer \"If the snow was not compacted, then the snow did not sprout the frink\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
