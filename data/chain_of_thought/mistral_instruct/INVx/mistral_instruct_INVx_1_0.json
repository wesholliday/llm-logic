If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\n\nThis statement represents a material implication, which means that if the first condition (the flugel being blimmed) is true, then the second condition (the flugel being zargled) must also be true. However, it does not necessarily mean that if the flugel is not blimmed, it cannot be zargled or that the two conditions are mutually exclusive.\n\nTo infer 'If the flugel was not blimmed, then the flugel was not zargled', we would need to establish the contrapositive of the original statement:\n\n1. If the flugel was not zargled, then it was not blimmed.\n\nUnfortunately, without any additional information about the relationship between 'blimming' and 'zargling' the flugel, we cannot definitively establish this contrapositive. It is possible for both conditions to be true or false independently of each other. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'If the flugel was not blimmed, then the flugel was not zargled'.\n\nAnswer: no.",
