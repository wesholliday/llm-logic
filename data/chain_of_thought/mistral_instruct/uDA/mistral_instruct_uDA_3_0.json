The contrapositive of \"If P then Q\" is \"If not Q then not P.\"\n\nStep 4: In our case, P represents \"the book was written by James,\" and Q represents \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nStep 5: Therefore, the contrapositive is \"If not Q (the book is not a mystery novel), then not P (the book was not written by James).\"\n\nStep 6: Since we know that not P (the book was not written by James), and the contrapositive tells us that if not P then not Q, we can infer that not Q (the book is not a mystery novel).\n\nAnswer: yes.",
