We also know that the car was not red.\n3. However, we do not have any information about the color of the truck other than what we can infer from the given conditional statement.\n4. Since the car is not red, the conditional statement does not apply in this case. It only tells us about the relationship between the colors of the car and the truck when the car is red.\n5. Therefore, we cannot make any definitive conclusions about the color of the truck based on the given information alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
