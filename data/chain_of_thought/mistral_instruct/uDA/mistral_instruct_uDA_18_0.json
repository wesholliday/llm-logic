If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nHowever, we don't know what material the doll or truck is made of if they are not plastic and not plastic respectively when the doll is not plastic. Therefore, it's possible that both the doll and truck could be made of other materials such as wood, fabric, or metal.
