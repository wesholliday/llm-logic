We also know that the apple was not red.\n3. However, we do not have any information about the color of the apple or the banana beyond these two statements.\n4. Therefore, even though we know that if the apple had been red, then the banana would have had to be yellow, we cannot infer anything about the colors of the fruits based on the given information alone. It's possible that the apple is a different color and the banana is still yellow, or it's possible that both fruits are a different color than what was stated in the original condition.\n\nAnswer: no.",
