If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest (according to the first statement).\n2. The griffin was not in the forest (according to the second statement).\n\nSince these two statements contradict each other, we cannot determine a definitive answer based on the given information alone. However, if we assume that neither statement is true or that both are false, then it's possible that the unicorn was not in the forest as well (since the presence or absence of one mythical creature doesn't necessarily imply the same for another). But without more information, we cannot be certain.\n\nAnswer: It's impossible to determine a definitive answer based on the given information alone.",
