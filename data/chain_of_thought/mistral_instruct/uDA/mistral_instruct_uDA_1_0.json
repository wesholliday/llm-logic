This creates a contradiction in the statement.\n2. The fact that there is a contradiction in the statement about Mary does not necessarily mean that there is a contradiction in the statements about Sue.\n3. We cannot make assumptions beyond what has been explicitly stated in the question.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no.",
