To determine whether we can infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo, we need to consider the given information and any logical implications.\n4. Since we know that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo, and we also know that Joe did not go to the park, it follows logically that Lucy did not go to the zoo as well.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: yes",
