In other words, if the flob is skizzled (cause), it does not move (effect).\n\nThe second statement, 'If the flob moved, then the flob was not skizzled', is also a conditional statement that establishes a cause-and-effect relationship between moving and not being skizzled for the flob. However, this statement suggests the opposite cause-and-effect relationship compared to the first statement. In other words, if the flob moved (cause), it was not skizzled (effect).\n\nTo determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to consider if they have the same meaning or if one can logically be derived from the other. However, since they suggest opposite cause-and-effect relationships, we cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no.",
