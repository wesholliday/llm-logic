The given statement is stating that if the shank is in the state of being plooked, then it cannot also be in the state of being nugged at the same time.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the inverse of the given statement 'If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked'\n\nThe inverse statement is stating that if the shank is in the state of being nugged, then it cannot also be in the state of being plooked at the same time.\n\nStep 3: Compare the given statement and its inverse\n\nBoth statements are negations of each other, meaning they contradict each other. The given statement states that plooked excludes nugged, while the inverse statement states that nugged excludes plooked. Since they are contradictory statements, we cannot infer one from the other based on the given information alone.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: no.",
