This statement is saying that if snow is compacted (solid and dense), it cannot sprout a frank (which is not a real thing). In other words, compacted snow does not have the ability to grow or produce anything.\n\nNow let's consider 'If the snow sprouted the frank, then the snow was not compacted'. This statement is saying that if snow sprouts a frank (again, not a real thing), it must not be compacted. However, since snow cannot sprout a frank in the first place, this conditional statement does not make any sense and cannot be used to infer anything about the relationship between compacted snow and the ability of snow to be compacted.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the snow sprouted the frank, then the snow was not compacted' from 'If the snow was compacted, then the snow did not sprout the frank'.\n\nAnswer: no.",
