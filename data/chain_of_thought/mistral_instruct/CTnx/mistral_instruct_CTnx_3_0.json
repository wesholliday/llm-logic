'If the splat was morphed, then the splat did not quank.' This statement suggests that if the splat underwent a morphing process, it did not make the sound 'quank'.\n2. 'If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed.' This statement suggests that if the splat made the sound 'quank', it did not undergo a morphing process.\n\nTo infer one statement from another, their meanings must be logically related. In this case, while both statements discuss the relationship between the splat's morphing and its sound, they make opposite claims about each other. Therefore, we cannot directly infer 'If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed' from 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat did not quank'.\n\nAnswer: no.",
