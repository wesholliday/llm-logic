'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble did not crink': This statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"if p, then q\". It means that if the condition p (the fribble was snurgled) is true, then the consequence q (the fribble did not crink) must also be true.\n2. 'If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled': This statement is also a conditional statement in the form of \"if p, then q\". It means that if the condition p (the fribble crinked) is true, then the consequence q (the fribble was not snurgled) must be true.\n\nTo infer one conditional statement from another, we need to ensure that they have the same antecedent (p) and consequent (q), but with opposite meanings. In this case, both statements have different antecedents and consequents. Therefore, we cannot directly infer 'If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled' from 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble did not crink'.\n\nAnswer: no.",
