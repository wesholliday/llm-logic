A contradiction is a statement that cannot be true at the same time. In this case, \"vroombed\" and \"not spended\" are contradictory terms. If something is vroombed (which could mean revved up or moved quickly), it is not spent (which means used up or exhausted).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given statement to determine if it implies 'If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed'.\n\nTo do this, we need to consider the meaning of each term in the context of the given statement. Since \"vroombed\" and \"not spended\" are contradictory terms, the statement is saying that if the dreb was vroombed (revved up or moved quickly), it was not spent (used up or exhausted).\n\nNow let's consider the statement 'If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed'. This statement is also a contradiction, but it is the opposite of the given statement. It is saying that if the dreb was spent (used up or exhausted), it was not vroombed (revved up or moved quickly).\n\nHowever, just because two statements are contradictions does not mean that one can be inferred from the other. In order to infer 'If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed' from 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was not spended', we would need a valid logical rule or assumption that connects the two statements.\n\nStep 3: Determine if there is a valid logical rule or assumption that connects the given statement to the statement we want to infer.\n\nIn this case, there is no valid logical rule or assumption that connects 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was not spended' to 'If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed'. The two statements are contradictory, but they do not logically imply each other.\n\nStep 4: Write the answer.\n\nAnswer: no.",
