'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink.' This statement indicates that if the grommet was sploffed (whatever that means in this context), it didn't plop the frink. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that plopping the frink causes the grommet to be unsploffed.\n\n2. 'If the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.' This statement suggests that if the grommet plopped the frink (again, whatever that means), it wasn't sploffed at that time. But we cannot infer this directly from the first statement since they don't have the same conditional relationship.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'If the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed'.\n\nAnswer: no.",
