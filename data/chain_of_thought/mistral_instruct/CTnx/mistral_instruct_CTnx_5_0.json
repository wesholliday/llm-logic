Without any context or definition provided, these terms are arbitrary and could represent anything. However, based on the given conditional statement 'If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled', we can infer that they represent mutually exclusive events.\n\nNow let's consider the inverse conditional statement 'If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled'. This statement is saying that if an event (smoogling) occurred, then another event (fraggling) did not occur. Since fraggling and smoogling are mutually exclusive events according to the original conditional statement, it follows that 'If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled' is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
