'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it did not surn': This statement is saying that if a fleeg (whatever that may be) was buttered, then it did not sneeze. In other words, the presence of butter on the fleeg prevents it from sneezing.\n2. 'If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered': This statement is saying that if a fleeg sneezes, then it was not buttered. In other words, the act of sneezing excludes the presence of butter on the fleeg.\n\nNow let's compare both statements:\n\n1. The first statement tells us that having butter on the fleeg prevents it from sneezing.\n2. The second statement tells us that sneezing excludes the presence of butter on the fleeg.\n\nThese two statements seem to contradict each other, as they both discuss the relationship between butter and sneezing but come to opposite conclusions. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered' from 'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it did not surn'.\n\nAnswer: no.",
