In this case, if the flugel was blimmed, then it was also zargled.\n3. To infer \"The flugel was zargled\" from these statements, we need to ensure that both conditions of a conditional statement are met:\n   a. The first condition is that the antecedent (the 'if' part) must be true. In this case, we know that \"The flugel was blimmed,\" so the antecedent is true.\n   b. The second condition is that the consequent (the 'then' part) must also be true whenever the antecedent is true. In this case, we don't have any direct evidence that \"The flugel was zargled\" is always true when \"The flugel was blimmed,\" but since we know that both statements are true in this specific instance, we can infer that \"The flugel was zargled\" must also be true for this particular occurrence.\n\nAnswer: yes.",
