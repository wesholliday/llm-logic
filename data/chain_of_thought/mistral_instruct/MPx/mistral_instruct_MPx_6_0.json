In other words, we would need to establish a causal relationship between the grommet being dislodged and the frink being dropped.\n\nWithout further context or information, it's impossible to definitively say whether this causal relationship exists. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The grommet plopped the frink\" with certainty based on the given statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no.",
