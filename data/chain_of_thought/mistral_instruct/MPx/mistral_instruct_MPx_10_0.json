It means that if the first event (sproing) occurs, then the second event (garpling) must also occur.\n2. \"The wug was sproinged\": This statement indicates that the first event (sproing) has occurred.\n\nNow let's consider what we can infer from these statements:\n\nSince the conditional statement tells us that if the wug is sproinged, then it must also be garpled, and we know that the wug was indeed sproinged, we can logically conclude that the wug must have been garpled as well.\n\nAnswer: yes",
