This premise sets up a disjunction (either/or statement).\n2. Premise 2 introduces a new possibility, stating that the cookies might not be hidden in the pantry at all.\n3. The conclusion asserts that the cookies are in the jar based on the given premises.\n4. However, the argument does not logically follow from the premises because the second premise introduces a new possibility (cookies not being hidden in the pantry) that was not accounted for in the first premise. Therefore, it's possible for the cookies to be elsewhere, and the conclusion that they are in the jar is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no.",
