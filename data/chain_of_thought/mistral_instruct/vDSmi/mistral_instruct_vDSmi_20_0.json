Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\n2. The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\n3. Therefore, the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nThe first premise is a disjunction (either/or statement), and the second premise introduces a possibility that contradicts one of the disjuncts (the sunglasses might not be perched on her head). However, just because one possible situation is ruled out, it doesn't mean that another possible situation must be true. In other words, the negation of one disjunct does not logically entail the truth of the other disjunct.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no.",
