Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. Premise 1: Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\n2. Premise 2: The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\n3. Conclusion: The remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nFirst, let's consider what we know from the premises:\n1. We know that the remote control could be either on the coffee table or hidden under the couch.\n2. We also know that it might not be hiding under the couch.\n\nNow, let's think about what the conclusion asserts: The remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nGiven the information from the premises, we cannot logically deduce that the remote control is on the coffee table. It could still be hidden somewhere else, such as behind a cushion or in another room entirely. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no.",
