It only tells us that Erin traveled by train.\n\nStep 3: Now let's examine Statement 2. This conditional statement is saying that if Sam took a plane, then Erin also took a train. This implies that taking a plane for Sam and a train for Erin are not mutually exclusive events. In other words, both Sam and Erin could have traveled by different modes of transportation.\n\nStep 4: Based on the given information, we cannot directly infer that 'Sam took a plane'. The conditional statement only tells us that if Sam did take a plane, then Erin would also have taken a train. It does not guarantee that Sam actually took a plane.\n\nAnswer: No.",
