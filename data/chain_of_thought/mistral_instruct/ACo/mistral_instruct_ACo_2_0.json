This statement is an if-then statement. It means that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is also in the forest. However, it does not necessarily mean that the griffin is actually in the forest.\n\nStep 3: Now let's consider both statements together. Statement 1 tells us that the unicorn is in the forest. Statement 2 tells us that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is also there. But it does not guarantee that the griffin is present.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that 'The griffin was in the forest'.\n\nAnswer: no.",
