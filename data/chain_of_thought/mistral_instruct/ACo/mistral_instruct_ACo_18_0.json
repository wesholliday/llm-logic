It states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck would be metal. This does not provide any direct information about the doll being plastic or not.\n\nStep 3: Determine what can be inferred from the given information.\n\nFrom the given statements, we cannot infer that 'The doll was plastic'. The first statement only tells us that the truck is metal, and the second statement tells us that if the doll were plastic, then the truck would still be metal. This does not contradict or support the idea that the doll is plastic.\n\nAnswer: no.",
