It states that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. This means that the presence of the cat outside implies that the dog was not inside. However, it does not directly tell us whether the dog was actually inside or not.\n\nStep 3: Let's consider the given information and the conditional statement together.\n\nWe know that the cat was outside. According to Statement 2, if the dog had been inside, then the cat would have also been outside. Since we know that the cat was outside, it follows that the dog could not have been inside at that moment in time.\n\nStep 4: Based on our analysis, can we infer 'The dog was inside'?\n\nNo, we cannot infer 'The dog was inside' based on the given information and the conditional statement alone. In fact, the given information and the conditional statement together imply that 'The dog was outside'. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Answer: no' if the question asks whether we can infer 'The dog was inside', but 'Answer: yes' if the question asks whether we can infer 'The dog was outside'.",
