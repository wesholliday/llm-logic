However, it does not guarantee that Lisa actually bought the red shirt. It only states a conditional relationship between Lisa's purchase of the red shirt and Mark's purchase of the blue shirt.\n\nStep 3: Consider the inference.\n\nTo infer 'Lisa bought the red shirt', we would need to have enough evidence to conclude that this statement is true. However, based on the given information alone, we cannot make such a conclusion. The second statement only tells us that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark would have bought the blue shirt as well. It does not guarantee that Lisa actually made the purchase.\n\nStep 4: Provide the answer.\n\nAnswer: no.",
