If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the meaning of each statement.\n\nStatement 1 means that Chris completed the race.\n\nStatement 2 is a conditional statement in the form \"If p, then q\". It means that if event p (Alex finishing the race) happens, then event q (Chris finishing the race) also happens. In other words, Chris finishing the race is a necessary consequence of Alex finishing the race.\n\nStep 3: Determine if we can infer 'Alex finishes the race'.\n\nThe given statements do not directly imply that Alex finishes the race. However, they do indicate that if Alex finishes the race, then Chris will finish as well. This is a necessary condition for Chris finishing the race but it does not guarantee that Alex finishes the race. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Alex finishes the race' based on the given statements alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
