However, it does not necessarily mean that P is true just because Q is true.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possibilities.\n\nLet's consider two possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The car is red and the truck is blue.\nIn this scenario, the given information \"The truck was blue\" is true, but the condition in the second statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is not satisfied because the car is indeed red, but the truck is not. Therefore, this scenario does not hold up.\n\nScenario 2: The car is not red and the truck is blue.\nIn this scenario, both the given information \"The truck was blue\" and the condition in the second statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" are satisfied because neither the car nor the truck is red, and the truck is indeed blue.\n\nStep 4: Make a conclusion based on the analysis.\n\nSince Scenario 1 does not satisfy both the given information and the condition in the second statement, it can be ruled out. Therefore, the only possible scenario that satisfies all the given information is Scenario 2, where the car is not red and the truck is blue.\n\nStep 5: Provide the final answer.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The car was red' from the given information.",
