The first statement tells us that the wolf is in the den.\n2. The second statement establishes a conditional relationship between the presence of the bear and the wolf. It states that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf is also in the den.\n3. However, this conditional statement does not guarantee that the bear is actually present in the cave. It only tells us that if the bear is there, then the wolf will be as well.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot directly infer that \"The bear was in the cave.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
