We have two statements: a) Jen watched basketball\n2. b) If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\n\nTo infer that Tom watched football from these statements, we would need to apply the given conditional statement (b) and see if it logically leads us to Tom watching football. However, we don't have any information about whether Tom actually watched football or not. The only thing we know is that if he did, then Jen watched basketball.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer that \"Tom watched football\" with certainty. We can only say that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n\nAnswer: no.",
