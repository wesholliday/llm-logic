We have two statements: \"Lucy went to the zoo\" and \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\".\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Joe went to the park) is true, then the second part (Lucy went to the zoo) must also be true.\n3. However, the first statement does not necessarily mean that Joe was at the park when Lucy was at the zoo. It only tells us that Lucy was at the zoo.\n4. Therefore, even though we know that if Joe went to the park and Lucy went to the zoo, then those two events must have happened in sequence, we cannot be certain that Joe was actually at the park when Lucy was at the zoo based on the given information alone.\n5. Thus, we cannot infer 'Joe went to the park' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no.",
