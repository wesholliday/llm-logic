The second statement, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" is a conditional statement that tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also there. Since we know that Sue was indeed at the wedding, it follows logically that if being at the wedding is a sufficient condition for Sue to be present, then it must also be true that being at the wedding is a sufficient condition for Mary to be present as well. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Mary was also at the wedding. Answer: yes.",
