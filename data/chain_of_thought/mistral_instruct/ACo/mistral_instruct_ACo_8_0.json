The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the condition) is true, then the second part (the consequence) must also be true.\n3. In this case, the condition is \"the vampire was awake\", and the consequence is \"the mummy was awake\".\n4. Since we know that \"the mummy was awake\" is a fact, we can use the conditional statement to infer that \"the vampire was awake\" must also be true.\n5. Therefore, the answer is: Answer: yes.",
