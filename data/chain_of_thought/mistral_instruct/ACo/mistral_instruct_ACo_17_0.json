The second piece of information is an conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the second part (Kate ate salad) must also be true. This is called the consequent.\n3. However, the converse is not necessarily true - just because Kate ate salad does not mean that Ben must have eaten pasta.\n4. In order to infer 'Ben ate pasta' from 'Kate ate salad' and 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad', we would need an additional piece of information that confirms the antecedent (Ben ate pasta) is true.\n5. Without this additional information, we cannot infer 'Ben ate pasta'.\n\nAnswer: no.",
