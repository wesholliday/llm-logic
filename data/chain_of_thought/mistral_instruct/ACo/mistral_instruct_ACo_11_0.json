It does not provide any information about the cake.\n\nStatement 2 is a conditional statement. It states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. This means that the two statements are related, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the cake is chocolate. The condition in Statement 2 could be true even if the cake is not chocolate.\n\nStep 3: Based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The cake was chocolate'.\n\nAnswer: no.",
