The banana was yellow.\n2. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nThis second statement is an if-then statement, also known as a conditional statement. It means that if the condition (apple being red) is true, then the consequence (banana being yellow) must also be true. However, it does not necessarily mean that the condition itself is true.\n\nGiven this information, we cannot directly infer that \"The apple was red\" based on the two statements provided. The first statement only tells us about the color of the banana, and the second statement establishes a relationship between the colors of the apple and the banana under certain conditions. We don't have enough evidence to conclude that the apple is indeed red without any additional information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
