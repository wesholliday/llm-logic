In this case, \"It's not the case that the grommet must have been sploffed\" means that it is possible for the grommet not to have been sploffed, but it does not guarantee that it was not. Therefore, we cannot directly infer \"The grommet might not have been sploffed,\" as there could still be other possibilities. However, if no other information contradicts this statement, then it is a valid assumption.\n\nAnswer: yes (but with the caveat that there may be other possible explanations as well)",
