In this case, 'It's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked' means that it was not necessary for the whiffle to have been shanked based on the available evidence or information. This does not necessarily imply that the whiffle might not have been shanked at all. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The whiffle might not have been shanked' directly from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no.",
