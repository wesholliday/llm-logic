The phrase \"it's not the case that X must have been Y\" means that there is no necessity or requirement for X to be Y. In other words, it's possible for X to be something other than Y.\n\nNow, let's consider the question. To infer \"The glip might not have been slogged\" from \"It's not the case that the glip must have been slogged,\" we need to understand what each statement means. The given statement tells us that there is no requirement for the glip to have been slogged. The question asks if this implies that the glip might not have been slogged at all.\n\nYes, the given statement does allow for the possibility that the glip was not slogged. If it were not possible for the glip to be anything other than slogged, then the statement \"it's not the case that the glip must have been slogged\" would be meaningless. Therefore, we can infer that \"The glip might not have been slogged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes.",
