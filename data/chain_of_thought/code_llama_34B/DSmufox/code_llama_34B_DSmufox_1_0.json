These two statements seem to be in conflict with each other, as one implies that the flugel cannot be zargled, while the other suggests that it must be zargled or blimmed. Therefore, these premises are not logically consistent.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\nSince the premises are not logically consistent, we cannot infer the conclusion. The conclusion does not follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
