The first premise states that the sneg must be sproted, while the second premise states that either the sneg must be sproted or it is crampled. However, the second premise does not provide any information about whether the sneg is crampled if it is not sproted. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the sneg is crampled based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
