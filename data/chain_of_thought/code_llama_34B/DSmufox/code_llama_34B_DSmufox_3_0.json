This means that there is a possibility that the splat is not quanked.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the splat is either quanked or morphed. This means that there are two possibilities: either the splat is quanked or it is morphed.\n\nStep 3: Can we infer \"The splat is morphed\"?\n\nBased on the analysis of the given statements, we can conclude that there is a possibility that the splat is not quanked. However, this does not necessarily mean that the splat is morphed. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The splat is morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
