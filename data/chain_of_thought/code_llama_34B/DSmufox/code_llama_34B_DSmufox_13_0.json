The second premise states that either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged, which implies that if the glip is not tragged, then it must be slogged.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nBased on the information provided in the premises, we can infer that if the glip is not tragged, then it must be slogged. Therefore, the conclusion \"The glip is slogged\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
