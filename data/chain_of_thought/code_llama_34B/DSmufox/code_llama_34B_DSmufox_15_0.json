These two premises are logically inconsistent with each other, as the first premise implies that the dreb does not have to be spened, but the second premise suggests that the dreb must be spened.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nBased on the inconsistent premises, we cannot infer that the dreb is vroombed. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nAnswer: No",
