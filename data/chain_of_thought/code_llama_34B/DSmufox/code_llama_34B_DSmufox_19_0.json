These two statements appear to be contradictory, as one states that the smonk cannot be plagged, while the other states that it must be plagged or vreebled. Therefore, these premises are not logically consistent and cannot be used to infer the conclusion.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\nSince the premises are not logically consistent, we cannot infer the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No",
