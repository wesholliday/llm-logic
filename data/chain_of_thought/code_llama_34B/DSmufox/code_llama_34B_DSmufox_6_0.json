These two statements appear to be in conflict with each other, as they imply that the grommet cannot be both not plopped and sploffed at the same time.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nBased on the conflicting nature of the premises, it is not possible to logically infer that the grommet is sploffed. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the grommet is sploffed based on these premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
