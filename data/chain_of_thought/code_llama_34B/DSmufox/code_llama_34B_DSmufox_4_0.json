These two statements appear to be contradictory, as one states that the fribble cannot be crinked, while the other states that it must be crinked or snurgled. Therefore, these premises are not logically consistent and cannot be used to infer the conclusion.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\nSince the premises are not logically consistent, we cannot use them to infer the conclusion. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the fribble is snurgled based on these premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
