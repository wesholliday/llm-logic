The assumption is that if Tom watched football, then Jen would also watch basketball. However, this assumption is not necessarily true. There is no inherent connection between watching football and watching basketball. Therefore, we cannot infer \"Jen watched basketball\" from the given premises.\n\nStep 3: Answer the question.\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer \"Jen watched basketball\" from the given premises.",
