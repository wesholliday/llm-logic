Premise 2 is a conditional statement, which is also considered to be valid if it is based on a true premise. However, we cannot assume that the conclusion follows logically from the premises without further evaluation.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion based on the validity of the premises.\n\nBased on the validity of the premises, we can conclude that the banana was yellow if and only if the apple was red. However, we cannot infer that the banana was yellow without additional information about the color of the apple.\n\nAnswer: No",
