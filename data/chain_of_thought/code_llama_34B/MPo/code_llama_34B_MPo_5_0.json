The second premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis, but it does not state that Jeff did play basketball. Therefore, we cannot infer that Amy played tennis based solely on the information provided in the argument.\n\nStep 3: Answer the question.\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'Amy played tennis' from the given premises.",
