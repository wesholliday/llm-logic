            "content": "\nStep 1: Identify the premises and conclusion.\nThe two premises are \"Ben ate pasta\" and \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\" The conclusion is \"Kate ate the salad.\"\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the validity of the argument.\nThe argument is valid because it follows the correct form of modus ponens, which states that if a conditional statement (if-then) and its antecedent (the 'if' part) are true, then the consequent (the 'then' part) must also be true. In this case, \"Ben ate pasta\" is the antecedent, \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\" is the conditional statement, and \"Kate ate the salad\" is the conclusion.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is sound.\nThe argument is sound because both premises are true. If Ben did eat pasta, and if eating pasta logically implies that Kate ate the salad, then it must be the case that Kate ate the salad.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
