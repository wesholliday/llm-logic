The second premise assumes that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy would also go to the zoo, but this assumption is not necessarily true. Therefore, we cannot infer \"Lucy went to the zoo\" from these premises.\n\nStep 3: Answer the question.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer \"Lucy went to the zoo\" from the given premises.",
