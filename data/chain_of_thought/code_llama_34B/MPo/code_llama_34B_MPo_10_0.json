The conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the premises are true.\n\nWe cannot determine whether the premises are true or false without additional information.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion based on the validity of the argument and the truth of the premises.\n\nBased on the validity of the argument, we can conclude that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. However, since we cannot determine whether the premises are true or false, we cannot draw a definitive conclusion about the truth of the statement \"The cat was outside.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
