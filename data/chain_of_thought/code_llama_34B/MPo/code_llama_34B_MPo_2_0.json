In this case, the antecedent is \"the griffin was in the forest,\" which we have already established to be true. Therefore, Premise 2 is also true.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nBased on the truth of both premises, the conclusion \"The unicorn was in the forest\" logically follows. This is because the second premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was also in the forest, and since we have established that the griffin was indeed in the forest, it follows that the unicorn must have been there as well.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
