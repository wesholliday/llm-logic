The statement \"the milk might not be on the counter\" simply means that there is a possibility that the milk is not on the counter, but it does not rule out the possibility that it is on the counter.\n\nFor example, if someone asks you \"Is the milk in the fridge?\", you could respond \"The milk might not be on the counter.\" This response would indicate that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge, but it does not mean that it's not possible for the milk to be in the fridge.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer from \"the milk might not be on the counter\" that it's not the case that the milk must be on the counter.",
