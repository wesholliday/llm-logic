The statement \"The jacket might not be draped over the chair\" simply means that there is a possibility that the jacket is not draped over the chair, but it does not rule out the possibility that it is.\n\nFor example, if we know that the jacket is not in the room, then we can infer that it's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair. However, if we only know that the jacket might not be draped over the chair, we cannot make any conclusions about whether it must be or must not be.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no, we cannot infer that it's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair.",
