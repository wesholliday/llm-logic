The statement \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\" simply means that there is a possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, but it does not rule out the possibility that she did buy it.\n\nTo infer that it's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt, we would need additional information or reasoning to support that conclusion. For example, if we knew that Lisa had a specific reason for not buying the red shirt, and that reason was known to be true, then we could infer that it's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt. However, without any additional information, we cannot make that inference.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no, we cannot infer that it's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt based solely on the statement \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt.\"",
