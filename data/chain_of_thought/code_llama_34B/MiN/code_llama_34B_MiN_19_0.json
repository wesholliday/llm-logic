The statement \"The watch might not be charging on the dresser\" simply means that there is a possibility that the watch is not charging on the dresser, but it does not rule out the possibility that it is charging on the dresser.\n\nTo infer that it's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser, we would need additional information or reasoning to support that conclusion. For example, if we know that the watch is not in its usual place on the dresser and there is no sign of it being charged, then we could infer that it's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser. However, without this additional information, we cannot make that inference based solely on the statement \"The watch might not be charging on the dresser.\"",
