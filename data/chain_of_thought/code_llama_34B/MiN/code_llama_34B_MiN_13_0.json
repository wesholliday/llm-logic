The statement \"The toy might not be in the toy box\" simply means that there is a possibility that the toy is not in the toy box, but it does not rule out the possibility that the toy is actually in the toy box.\n\nFor example, if we have a toy car and we put it in a toy box, then we can say \"The toy might not be in the toy box\" because there is a possibility that someone might have taken the toy car out of the box. However, this does not mean that it's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box, because it could still be in the box and we just don't know for sure.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\" from \"The toy might not be in the toy box\".",
