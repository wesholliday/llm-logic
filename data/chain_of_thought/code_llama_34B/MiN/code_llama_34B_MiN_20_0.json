The statement \"The sunglasses might not be in her bag\" simply means that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not in her bag, but it does not rule out the possibility that they are in her bag.\n\nFor example, if someone asks you \"Did you see the sunglasses?\" and you respond \"The sunglasses might not be in her bag,\" it means that you have not seen the sunglasses, but you are not ruling out the possibility that they could be in her bag.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer from \"The sunglasses might not be in her bag\" that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag.",
