The statement \"The scarf might not be stuffed in my backpack\" simply means that there is a possibility that the scarf is not in your backpack, but it does not rule out the possibility that it is.\n\nFor example, if you have a red scarf and you are looking for it in your backpack, and you don't see it at first glance, you might say \"The scarf might not be stuffed in my backpack\" because you haven't found it yet. But if you then find the scarf in your backpack, you would conclude that the statement \"The scarf might not be stuffed in my backpack\" was false, and that the scarf must have been in your backpack all along.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer from \"The scarf might not be stuffed in my backpack\" that it's not the case that the scarf must be stuffed in your backpack.",
