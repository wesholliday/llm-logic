Premise 2 is a conditional statement, which is also logically valid. Therefore, both premises are logically valid.\n\nStep 3: Determine the logical relationship between the premises and conclusion.\n\nThe conclusion \"The apple was not red\" can be inferred from the premises using modus tollens, which is a valid argument form. Modus tollens states that if a conditional statement is true and the conclusion of the conditional statement is false, then the antecedent of the conditional statement must also be false. In this case, the conditional statement is \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" and the conclusion is \"The apple was not red.\" Therefore, we can infer that the antecedent of the conditional statement, \"the apple was red,\" must also be false.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the argument for soundness.\n\nBased on the evaluation of the premises and the logical relationship between them and the conclusion, the argument is sound. The premises are logically valid, and the conclusion follows necessarily from them. Therefore, we can conclude that the argument is sound.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
