            "content": "\nStep 1: Identify the premises and conclusion.\nThe first premise is \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\" The second premise is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" The conclusion we want to draw is \"Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the premises.\nThe first premise states that it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. This means that there is a possibility that Sue did not attend the wedding. The second premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This means that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue would also have attended the wedding.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion.\nWe want to determine whether we can infer \"Mary was not at the wedding\" based on the premises. If Mary did attend the wedding, then Sue must have been there too (according to the second premise). However, since we know that Sue didn't attend the wedding (according to the first premise), it means that Mary cannot have attended the wedding either. Therefore, we can infer \"Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
