In this case, the antecedent is \"the bear was in the cave,\" and the consequent is \"the wolf must have been in the den.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nBased on the evaluation of the premises, we can see that Premise 1 is true, but Premise 2 is not necessarily true. Therefore, we cannot infer that the bear was not in the cave based solely on these two premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
