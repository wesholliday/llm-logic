            "content": "\nStep 1: Identify the premises and conclusion.\nThe first premise is \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" The second premise is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" The conclusion is \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the premises.\nThe first premise states that Mark did not necessarily buy the blue shirt. This means that there is a possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. The second premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This means that if Lisa bought the red shirt, Mark would have had to buy the blue shirt.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion.\nThe conclusion is \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" Based on the premises, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt because there is a possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, and if Lisa bought the red shirt, Mark would have had to buy the blue shirt. Therefore, the conclusion is supported by the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
