The second premise is an if-then statement, which is also logically consistent.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nNo, we cannot infer that the cake was not chocolate based on the given premises. The first premise only tells us that the muffins were not blueberry, but it does not provide any information about the cake. The second premise tells us that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry, but it does not tell us what happened if the cake was not chocolate. Therefore, we cannot draw a conclusion about the cake based on these premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
