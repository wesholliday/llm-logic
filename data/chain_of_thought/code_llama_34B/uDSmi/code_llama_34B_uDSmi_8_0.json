The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" suggests that there are two possible locations for the remote control: the coffee table and under the couch. However, this does not mean that one of these locations is true and the other is false. It is possible that the remote control is in neither location, or that it is in both locations at once.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the remote control is on the coffee table based on the information provided.",
