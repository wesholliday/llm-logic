The statement \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" implies that there are only two possible options for the location of the jacket: either it is draped over the chair or it is hanging in the closet. However, the statement \"the jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" suggests that there is a third option: the jacket could be somewhere else entirely. Therefore, we cannot infer that the jacket is draped over the chair based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No",
