The statement \"Fido is either inside or in the garden\" does not necessarily mean that Fido is inside. It could also mean that Fido is in the garden but not inside. Additionally, the statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden at all. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Fido is inside based on this information alone.",
