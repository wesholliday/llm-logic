The second premise states that either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden, which means that Fido is in at least one of the two locations.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion.\nThe conclusion states that Fido is inside, which means that Fido is in one of the two locations (inside). However, based on the first premise, we know that Fido is not in the garden, so the only remaining possibility is that Fido is inside. Therefore, the conclusion is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
