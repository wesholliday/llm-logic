Premise 2 is an inclusive \"either-or\" statement, which means that either the jacket is draped over the chair or it is hanging in the closet.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nBased on the information provided, we cannot infer that the jacket is draped over the chair. The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises because there is no guarantee that the jacket is not hanging in the closet and also not draped over the chair. Therefore, the argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: No",
