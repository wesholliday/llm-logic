The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is a conditional statement, which means that it is possible for the pants to be denim even if the shirt is not cotton.\n\nFor example, if the shirt was made of silk and the pants were made of denim, we cannot infer that the pants were not denim just because the shirt was not cotton. The two statements are not logically connected in this case.\n\nTherefore, we cannot make a conclusion about the type of fabric used for the pants based solely on the information provided.",
