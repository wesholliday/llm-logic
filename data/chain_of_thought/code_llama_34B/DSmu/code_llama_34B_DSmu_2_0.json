(negation)\nConclusion: The book is on the shelf (affirmative statement)\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\nThe argument is valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises. If the book is not resting on the table, then it must be on the shelf, as per the first premise. Therefore, the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises.\n\nStep 4: Determine whether the argument is sound.\n\nThe argument is sound because the premises are true. If the book is not resting on the table, then it must be on the shelf, and this is a true statement. Therefore, the argument is both valid and sound.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
