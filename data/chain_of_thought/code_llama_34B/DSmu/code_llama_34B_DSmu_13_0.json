This premise is logically consistent because it presents two exclusive options for the location of the toy.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf. This premise is also logically consistent because it negates the possibility that the toy is sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nThe conclusion states that the toy is in the toy box. To determine if this conclusion follows logically from the premises, we need to evaluate whether the premises provide sufficient evidence to support the conclusion.\n\nIn this case, the first premise provides evidence that the toy could be in the toy box, while the second premise provides evidence that it cannot be sitting on the bookshelf. However, the first premise also states that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf if it is not in the toy box. Since we have already established that the toy cannot be sitting on the bookshelf, this means that the only remaining possibility is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nTherefore, based on the premises provided, we can logically infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
