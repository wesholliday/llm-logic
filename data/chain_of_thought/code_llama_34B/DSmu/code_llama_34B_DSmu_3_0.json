Premise 2 is a negation, which means it is true if the statement it negates is false. The conclusion is a positive statement that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nStep 4: Draw a truth table to evaluate the argument.\n\n| Premise 1 | Premise 2 | Conclusion |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| True | False | True |\n| False | True | False |\n| True | True | True |\n| False | False | False |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that the argument is valid if and only if Premise 1 is true and Premise 2 is false. In this case, the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nStep 5: Answer the question.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer 'The keys are in the drawer' based on the given premises.",
