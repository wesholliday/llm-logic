            "content": "\nStep 1: Identify the premises and conclusion.\nThe premises are \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" and \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" The conclusion is \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the structure of the argument.\nThe argument is an example of a syllogism, which consists of two premises and a conclusion. The first premise is a disjunction (either-or) statement, while the second premise is a negation (it's not the case that) statement. The conclusion logically follows from these premises.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the argument.\nThe argument is valid because it follows the rules of logic. The first premise states that either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden, and the second premise negates the possibility that Fido must be in the garden. Therefore, we can logically conclude that Fido is inside.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the soundness of the argument.\nThe argument is sound because it is both valid and has true premises. The first premise is a disjunction statement, which is a type of logical connective that joins two statements together. The second premise is a negation statement, which also follows the rules of logic. Therefore, we can conclude that Fido is inside with certainty.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
