The premise \"The notebook might not be in the drawer\" does not necessarily mean that the notebook must not be in the drawer, only that there is a possibility that it may not be. Therefore, the conclusion \"It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer\" is not logically supported by the premise.",
