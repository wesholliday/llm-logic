The premise \"The shoes might not be in the closet\" implies that there is a possibility that the shoes are not in the closet, but it does not necessarily mean that they must not be in the closet. Therefore, the conclusion \"It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet\" is not logically supported by the premise.",
