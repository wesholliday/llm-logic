The premises only establish that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. They do not provide any information about the color of the cake or the type of muffins in the absence of chocolate cake. Therefore, it is not valid to conclude that the cake was chocolate based solely on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
