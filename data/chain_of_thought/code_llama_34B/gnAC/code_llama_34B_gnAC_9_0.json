The truth of the conclusion does not logically follow from the truth of the premises unless the antecedent (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true. Therefore, Premise 1 is valid.\n\nPremise 2 is a simple statement that asserts Mark's action of buying the blue shirt. It does not contain any logical connectives or conditional statements, so it is also valid.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is logically sound.\n\nThe argument is logically sound because both premises are true and the conclusion logically follows from them. The truth of the premises implies the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
