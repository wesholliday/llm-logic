The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" implies a causal relationship between Tom's behavior and Jen's behavior, but it does not imply a symmetric relationship. In other words, just because Tom watched football does not mean that Jen will watch basketball, and just because Jen watched basketball does not mean that Tom will watch football.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football. The correct answer is \"no\".",
