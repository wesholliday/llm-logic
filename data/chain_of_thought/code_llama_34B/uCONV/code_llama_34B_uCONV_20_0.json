            "content": "\nStep 1: Identify the premise and conclusion of the argument.\nThe premise is \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" The conclusion is \"Can we infer that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red?\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the premise and conclusion.\nThe conclusion asks whether we can infer that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red. This is a different statement from the premise, which states that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red based on the given premise.\n\nStep 3: Consider alternative possibilities.\nIt's possible that there is a third factor that affects both the color of the apple and the banana. For example, if the fruit was grown in a specific region with a particular climate or soil conditions, it could affect the color of both fruits. In this case, we cannot infer that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red based on the given premise alone.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the argument.\nBased on the analysis above, we cannot infer that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red based on the given premise. Therefore, the argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: No",
