The statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" implies a causal relationship between the two activities, but it does not imply a reciprocal relationship. In other words, just because Jeff played basketball does not mean that Amy will play tennis, and just because Amy played tennis does not mean that Jeff will play basketball.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball.
