The statement \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest\" is a logical consequence of the premise, but it does not follow from it. To see why, consider a possible world where the griffin is in the forest and the unicorn is not. In this world, the premise \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" is true, but the conclusion \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest\" is false. Therefore, we cannot infer the conclusion from the premise.",
