This is because the two statements are not logically connected in a way that would allow us to draw such a conclusion.\n\nTo see why, consider the following:\n\n* If the apple is red, then the banana is yellow.\n* If the apple is not red, then the banana is not yellow.\n\nIn this case, we have two statements that are logically connected in a way that would allow us to draw the conclusion that if the apple is not red, then the banana is not yellow. However, this does not mean that we can infer the same thing from the original statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow based on the given statement.",
