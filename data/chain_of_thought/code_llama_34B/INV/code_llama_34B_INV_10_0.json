The statement \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside\" is a different statement from \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" The first statement implies that if the dog was not inside, the cat could have been either inside or outside, while the second statement implies that if the dog was inside, the cat must have been outside.\n\nTo see why we cannot infer the second statement from the first, consider a scenario where the dog is not inside and the cat is also not inside. In this case, both statements are true, but the conclusion \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside\" does not logically follow. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside\" from \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\"",
