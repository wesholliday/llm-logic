The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" does not imply a causal relationship between the type of fabric used for the shirt and the type of fabric used for the pants. It is possible that the person wore a cotton shirt and denim pants, but it is also possible that they wore a cotton shirt and another type of pants, or a non-cotton shirt and denim pants.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim. The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion about the relationship between the type of fabric used for the shirt and the type of fabric used for the pants.",
