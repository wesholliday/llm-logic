It is possible for the doll to be made of a material other than plastic and the truck to be made of a material other than metal.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n* The doll could be made of wood and the truck could be made of rubber. In this case, the statement \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal\" is true, but the original statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal\" from the original statement.",
