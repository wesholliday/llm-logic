Premise 2 is a conditional statement, which means that it implies a causal relationship between the presence of the griffin and the presence of the unicorn.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The premises only imply that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest. However, this does not mean that the griffin was not in the forest if the unicorn was not there. Therefore, we cannot infer that the griffin was not in the forest based on these premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
