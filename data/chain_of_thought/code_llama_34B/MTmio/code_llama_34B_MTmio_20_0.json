The first premise states that the banana might not have been yellow, but it does not provide any information about the color of the apple. The second premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow, but it does not provide any information about whether the apple is actually red. Therefore, we cannot infer that the apple was not red based on these premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
