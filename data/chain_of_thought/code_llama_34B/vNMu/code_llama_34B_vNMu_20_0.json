The premise \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag\" does not necessarily imply that the sunglasses might not be in her bag. It only means that there is no guarantee that they are in her bag, but it does not rule out the possibility that they could be in her bag. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.",
