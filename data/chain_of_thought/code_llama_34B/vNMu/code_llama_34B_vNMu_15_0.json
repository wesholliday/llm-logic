The premise \"It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet\" does not necessarily imply that the shoes might not be in the closet. It could also mean that the shoes are not required to be in the closet, but they could still be there. Therefore, the conclusion \"The shoes might not be in the closet\" is not logically supported by the premise.",
