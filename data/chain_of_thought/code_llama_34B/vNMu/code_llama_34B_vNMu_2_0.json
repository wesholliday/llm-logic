The premise \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\" does not necessarily imply that the griffin might not have been in the forest. It only means that there is no evidence to suggest that the griffin was in the forest, but it does not rule out the possibility entirely. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.",
