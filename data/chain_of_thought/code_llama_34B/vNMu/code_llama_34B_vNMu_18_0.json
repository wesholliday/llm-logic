The premise \"It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer\" does not necessarily imply that the notebook might not be in the drawer. It could still be in the drawer, but not necessarily so. Therefore, the conclusion \"The notebook might not be in the drawer\" is not logically supported by the premise.",
