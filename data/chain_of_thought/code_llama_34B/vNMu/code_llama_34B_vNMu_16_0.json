The premise \"It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag\" does not necessarily mean that the pen might not be in the bag, as there could be other possibilities such as the pen being lost or stolen. Therefore, the conclusion \"The pen might not be in my bag\" is not logically supported by the premise.",
