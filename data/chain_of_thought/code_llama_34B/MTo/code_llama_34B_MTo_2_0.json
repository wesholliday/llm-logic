This statement is true, as we know that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nPremise 2 is a conditional statement that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. This statement is false, as we know that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nConclusion: The griffin was not in the forest.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the evaluation of the premises and conclusion.\n\nBased on the evaluation of the premises and conclusion, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest. This is because the conditional statement in Premise 2 is false, which means that the conclusion cannot be true. Therefore, the only possible conclusion is that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
