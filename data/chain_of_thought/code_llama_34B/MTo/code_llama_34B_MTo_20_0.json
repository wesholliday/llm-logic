This is a factual statement and does not imply anything about the color of the apple.\n\nThe second premise uses the material implication \"if...then...\" which means that the conclusion will only be true if the antecedent (the apple being red) is false. Therefore, we cannot infer that the apple was not red based solely on this premise.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nBased on the analysis in step 2, we cannot conclude that the apple was not red. The second premise does not provide enough information to infer that the apple was not red, and the first premise does not provide any information about the color of the apple. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: No",
