The first premise states that the cat was not outside, and the second premise states that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. Therefore, if we assume that the dog was inside, we can conclude that the cat was outside, which is a true statement based on the first premise.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is sound.\n\nThe argument is sound because it is both valid and has true premises. The first premise is true because it states a fact about the location of the cat, and the second premise is true because it follows from the definition of \"if...then\" statements. Therefore, we can conclude that the dog was inside based on the argument.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
