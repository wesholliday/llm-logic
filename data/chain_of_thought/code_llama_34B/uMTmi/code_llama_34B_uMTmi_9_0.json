The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" implies a causal relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. However, the statement \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt\" does not necessarily contradict this causal relationship. It is possible that Mark did not buy the blue shirt for some other reason, such as not having enough money or not being interested in the color.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt based on the information provided.",
