The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\" is a logical consequence of the premise \"The shirt and pants were made of the same material.\" However, this does not mean that the shirt was necessarily cotton or that the pants were necessarily denim. The statement only implies that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants would have been denim, but it does not provide any information about the actual materials used for the shirt and pants. Therefore, we cannot infer that the shirt was not cotton based on this information alone.",
