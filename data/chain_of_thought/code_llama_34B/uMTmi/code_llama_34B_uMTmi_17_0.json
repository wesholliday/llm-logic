The statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad\" is a conditional statement, which means that it is possible for Ben to have eaten pasta without Kate having eaten salad. Additionally, the statement \"Kate might not have eaten salad\" does not provide any information about whether or not Ben ate pasta. Therefore, we cannot draw a conclusion about Ben's food choice based on this information.\n\nAnswer: No",
