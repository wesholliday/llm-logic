The first premise states that if the fribble was snurgled, then it would crink. However, the second premise states that the fribble was not snurgled. This means that the first premise is irrelevant to the truth of the conclusion.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The fribble did not crink' from the given argument.",
