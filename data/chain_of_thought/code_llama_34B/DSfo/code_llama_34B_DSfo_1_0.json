The second premise, \"Either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside,\" is a disjunction, meaning it states two exclusive options. If Fido is not in the garden, then the only remaining option is that Fido is inside.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion.\nBased on the analysis of the premises, we can infer that \"Fido is inside\" is a valid conclusion. Therefore, the answer is yes, we can infer \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
