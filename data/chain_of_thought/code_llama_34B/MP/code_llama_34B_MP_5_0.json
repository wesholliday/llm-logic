The conclusion logically follows from the premises, and we can infer that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is sound.\n\nThe argument is sound because the premises are true. If Jeff did play basketball, then it is indeed possible that Amy played tennis. However, without further information, we cannot conclude with certainty that Amy actually played tennis.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
