            "content": "\nStep 1: Identify the premises and conclusion of the argument.\n\nThe premises are \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" and \"Joe went to the park.\" The conclusion is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\nThe argument is valid because it follows the correct form of a hypothetical syllogism, which consists of two premises and a conclusion. The first premise states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy would go to the zoo. The second premise states that Joe did go to the park. Therefore, based on these two premises, we can logically conclude that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is sound.\n\nThe argument is sound because the premises are true and the conclusion follows logically from them. If Joe did go to the park, then it is necessarily true that Lucy went to the zoo. Therefore, we can confidently say that \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
