Premise 2 is a positive statement, which is also a valid form of argumentation. Therefore, both premises are valid.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The premises only establish that if the apple was red, then the banana would be yellow. However, they do not provide any information about the color of the banana in this specific case. Therefore, we cannot infer that the banana is yellow based solely on these premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
