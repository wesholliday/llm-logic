The second premise states that the toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf, which implies that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nBased on the premises, we can infer that the toy is either in the bookshelf or in the toy box. However, since the second premise states that the toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf, it does not necessarily mean that the toy is in the toy box. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: No",
