The second premise states that the pen might not be on my desk. This means that there is a possibility that the pen is not on my desk.\n3. Based on the first and second premises, we can conclude that if the pen is not on my desk, it must be in my bag. Therefore, since the pen might not be on my desk, it is in my bag.",
