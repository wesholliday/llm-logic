The statement \"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf\" means that the book is either on the table or on the shelf, but we don't know which one it is.\n2. The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" means that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table.\n3. Since the book cannot be in two places at once, if it is not on the table, it must be on the shelf. Therefore, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.",
