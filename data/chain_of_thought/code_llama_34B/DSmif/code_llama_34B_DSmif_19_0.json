The statement \"Either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser\" means that the watch cannot be in both places at once.\n2. Since we know that the watch is not on his wrist, it must be in one of the other two places mentioned in the statement: either charging on the dresser or somewhere else.\n3. However, since we are given the additional information \"The watch might not be on his wrist,\" we can rule out the possibility that the watch is somewhere else.\n4. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the watch is charging on the dresser.",
