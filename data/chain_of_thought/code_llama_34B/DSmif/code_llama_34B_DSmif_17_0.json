The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack.\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack. This is because if the scarf were draped on the coat rack, it would not be \"might not be\" draped on the coat rack, but rather \"is\" draped on the coat rack. Therefore, since we are told that the scarf might not be draped on the coat rack, it must be stuffed in my backpack instead.",
