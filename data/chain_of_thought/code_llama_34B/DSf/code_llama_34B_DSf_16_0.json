The statement \"Either the pen is on my desk or it is in my bag\" means that the pen is either on my desk or in my bag, but we don't know which one it is.\n2. The statement \"The pen isn't on my desk\" means that the pen is not on my desk.\n3. Since the pen is not on my desk and we know that it is either on my desk or in my bag, we can infer that the pen must be in my bag.\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that \"The pen is in my bag\" is a true statement.",
