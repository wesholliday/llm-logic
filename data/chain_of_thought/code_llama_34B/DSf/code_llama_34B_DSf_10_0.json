The statement \"Either the missing sock is under the bed or it's in the laundry basket\" means that there are only two possible locations for the missing sock: under the bed or in the laundry basket.\n2. The statement \"The missing sock isn't under the bed\" rules out one of the possible locations, which is under the bed.\n3.
