This is a logically consistent statement.\n\nThe second premise states that the toy isn't sitting on the shelf, which means that the toy must be somewhere else. This is also a logically consistent statement.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nBased on the premises, we can infer that the toy is not sitting on the shelf. However, this does not necessarily mean that the toy is in the toy box. It is possible that the toy could be somewhere else entirely. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that the toy is in the toy box based solely on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
