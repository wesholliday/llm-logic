The statement \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\" means that there is no logical necessity for the griffin to be in the forest. However, this does not mean that the griffin could not have been in the forest. It simply means that we cannot conclude with certainty that the griffin was or was not in the forest based on the information provided.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The griffin might not have been in the forest\" from \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest.\"",
