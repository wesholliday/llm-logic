The statement \"It's not the case that the newspaper must be in the driveway\" means that there is no logical necessity for the newspaper to be in the driveway. It does not imply that the newspaper is or is not in the driveway, only that it is not necessary for it to be there.\n\nFor example, if I say \"It's not the case that the sky must be blue,\" this means that there is no logical necessity for the sky to be blue. It does not imply that the sky is or is not blue, only that it is not necessary for it to be blue.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer from \"It's not the case that the newspaper must be in the driveway\" that the newspaper might not be in the driveway.",
