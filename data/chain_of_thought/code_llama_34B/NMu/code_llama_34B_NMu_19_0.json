The statement \"It's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser\" simply means that there is no logical necessity for the watch to be charging on the dresser. It does not provide any information about whether or not the watch is actually charging on the dresser.\n\nTo infer that the watch might not be charging on the dresser, we would need additional information or evidence. For example, if we observed the watch not charging on the dresser, or if we were told by someone else that the watch was not charging on the dresser, then we could infer that the watch might not be charging on the dresser. However, without any additional information, we cannot make a conclusion about whether or not the watch is charging on the dresser based solely on the statement \"It's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\"",
