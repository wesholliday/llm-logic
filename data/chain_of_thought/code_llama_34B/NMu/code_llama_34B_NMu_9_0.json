            "content": "\nNo, we cannot infer that Lisa might not have bought the red shirt. The statement \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" simply means that there is no logical necessity for Lisa to have bought the red shirt. It does not imply anything about whether or not she actually did buy it.\n\nTo infer that Lisa might not have bought the red shirt, we would need additional information or evidence that suggests she did not buy it. For example, if we know that Lisa was not at the store on the day the red shirt was sold, then we could infer that she did not buy it. However, without any such additional information, we cannot conclude that Lisa might not have bought the red shirt based solely on the statement \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
