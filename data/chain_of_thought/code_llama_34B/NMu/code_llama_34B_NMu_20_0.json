The statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag\" simply means that there is no logical necessity for the sunglasses to be in her bag. It does not imply anything about whether or not they are actually in her bag.\n\nFor example, it's possible that the sunglasses could be in her hand, on her head, or somewhere else entirely. The statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag\" simply means that there is no logical requirement for them to be in her bag, but it doesn't provide any information about their actual location.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the sunglasses might not be in her bag based on this statement alone.",
