If the fleeg was not bluttered, and bluttering implies surning, then it is necessarily true that the fleeg did not surn.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is sound.\n\nThe argument is sound because the premises are true. The first premise states that the fleeg was not bluttered, and the second premise states that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from these premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
