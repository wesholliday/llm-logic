However, if it means that the book is simply located near the table, then the premise is not logically valid.\n\nPremise 2: Logical validity depends on the interpretation of \"either...or.\" If this phrase means that one and only one of the options is true, then the premise is logically valid. However, if it means that both options are possible, then the premise is not logically valid.\n\nStep 4: Determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nIf Premise 1 and Premise 2 are both logically valid, then the conclusion does not logically follow. This is because the conclusion assumes that the book is on the shelf, but it is possible that the book is resting on the table. Therefore, we cannot infer that the book is on the shelf based solely on these premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
