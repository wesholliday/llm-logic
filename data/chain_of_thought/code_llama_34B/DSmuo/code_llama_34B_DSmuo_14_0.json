The second premise states that either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge, but we already know from the first premise that it's not in the fridge. Therefore, the only possible location for the milk is on the counter.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nBased on our evaluation of the premises, we can conclude that the milk is on the counter. This conclusion logically follows from the premises because it is the only possible location for the milk based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
