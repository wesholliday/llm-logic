We know that \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" is equivalent to \"The toy is not sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\nStep 2: Now, let's analyze the second piece of information: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\" This statement can be broken down into two parts: (1) The toy is in the toy box; and (2) The toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nStep 3: We know that the toy is not sitting on the bookshelf, so we can eliminate the second part of the statement. This leaves us with \"The toy is in the toy box.\"\n\nStep 4: Therefore, we can infer that \"The toy is in the toy box\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
