Premise 1 does not contradict Premise 2.\n\nStep 3: Draw conclusions\n\nWe cannot infer \"The phone is in the living room\" from the given premises. The premises only tell us that the phone is not necessarily ringing in the kitchen, and if it's not in the living room, then it must be ringing in the kitchen. However, they do not provide any information about the location of the phone in the living room.\n\nAnswer: No",
