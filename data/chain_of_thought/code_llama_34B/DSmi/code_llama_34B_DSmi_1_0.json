This means that if Fido is not inside, then they must be in the garden. The second premise states that Fido might not be in the garden. This means that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion.\nBased on the analysis of the premises, we can conclude that Fido is inside. If Fido is not inside, then they must be in the garden, but since there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, it follows that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
