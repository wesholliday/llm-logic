It assumes that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it would surned, but it does not provide any evidence to support this claim. Therefore, Premise 1 is invalid.\n\nPremise 2 is a straightforward statement about the fleeg surning, and it provides no new information that can help us infer whether the fleeg was bluttered or not.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the argument as a whole.\n\nSince both premises are invalid, the argument is also invalid. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The fleeg was bluttered' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
