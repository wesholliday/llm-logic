The second premise states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy would go to the zoo. However, this does not mean that if Lucy did go to the zoo, then Joe must have gone to the park. Therefore, we cannot infer that Joe went to the park based on the given information.\n\nStep 3: Answer the question.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'Joe went to the park' from the given premises.",
