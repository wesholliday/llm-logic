The first premise states that the banana was yellow, but it does not provide any information about the color of the apple. The second premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana would also be yellow, but it does not tell us whether the apple is actually red or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that the apple was red based on these premises.\n\nStep 3: Answer the question.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The apple was red' from the given argument.",
