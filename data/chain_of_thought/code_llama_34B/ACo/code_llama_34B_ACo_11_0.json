The first premise only tells us that the muffins were blueberry, but it does not tell us anything about the cake. The second premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the cake was chocolate) is true, then the consequent (the muffins were blueberry) must also be true. However, this does not mean that if the consequent is true, then the antecedent must also be true. Therefore, we cannot infer that the cake was chocolate based on these premises.\n\nStep 3: Answer the question.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The cake was chocolate' from the given premises.",
