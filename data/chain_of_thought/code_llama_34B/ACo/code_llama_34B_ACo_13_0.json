The premise \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" only tells us that if the car was red, then the truck would also be blue. It does not tell us whether the car is actually red or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that the car was red based on these premises.\n\nStep 3: Answer the question.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The car was red' from the given argument.",
