The first premise states that the unicorn was in the forest, but it does not provide any information about the griffin's presence or absence in the forest. The second premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was also in the forest, but this statement does not imply that the griffin was actually present in the forest. Therefore, we cannot infer that the griffin was in the forest based on these premises.\n\nStep 3: Answer the question.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The griffin was in the forest' from the given premises.",
