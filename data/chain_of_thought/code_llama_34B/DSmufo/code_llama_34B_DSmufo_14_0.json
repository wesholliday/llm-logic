The second premise states that either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter, but since we know from the first premise that the milk is not chilling in the fridge, we can infer that it is on the counter.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nYes, the conclusion logically follows from the premises. If the milk is not chilling in the fridge and either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter, then it must be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
