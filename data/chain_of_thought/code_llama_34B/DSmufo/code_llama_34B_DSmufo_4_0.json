Since we have already identified the negation and the disjunction, we can apply De Morgan's laws to transform the premise into its negation. The transformed premise is \"The cat must not be playing in the bedroom and the cat must not be napping on the couch.\"\n\nStep 4: Compare the transformed premise with the conclusion \"The cat is napping on the couch.\" Since the transformed premise does not contain the conclusion, we cannot infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: No",
