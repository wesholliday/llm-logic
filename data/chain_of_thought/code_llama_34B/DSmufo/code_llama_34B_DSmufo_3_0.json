Modus ponens states that if we have two statements, one of which is a logical consequence of the other, and the other statement is true, then the first statement must also be true.\n\nIn this case, we can use modus ponens with the following steps:\n\n1. Premise 2: K \u2208 (C \u2228 D)\n2. Conclusion: K \u2208 D\n3. Modus ponens: If K \u2208 (C \u2228 D), then K \u2208 D\n4. Therefore, if Premise 2 is true, then the conclusion must be true.\n\nStep 4: Determine if the premises are true.\n\nIn this case, we cannot determine if the premises are true or false without additional information. However, we can use the rules of logic to determine if the conclusion follows from the premises under certain conditions.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
