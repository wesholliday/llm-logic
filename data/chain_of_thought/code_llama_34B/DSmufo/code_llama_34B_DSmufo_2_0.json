If we interpret this as meaning that the book is physically resting on the table, then the premise is logically valid. However, if we interpret this as meaning that it is not possible for the book to be resting on the table, then the premise is logically invalid.\n\nPremise 2: Logical validity depends on the interpretation of \"either...or\". If we interpret this as meaning that one and only one of the options is true, then the premise is logically valid. However, if we interpret this as meaning that both options are possible, then the premise is logically invalid.\n\nStep 4: Determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nIf Premise 1 is logically valid and Premise 2 is logically invalid, then the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The book is on the shelf\" based solely on these two premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
