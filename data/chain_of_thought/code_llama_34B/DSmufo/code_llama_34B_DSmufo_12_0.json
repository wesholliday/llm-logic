Premise 2 is an inclusive \"either-or\" statement, which means that the jacket must be either hanging in the closet or draped over the chair.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The premises only tell us that the jacket is not hanging in the closet, and it may be draped over the chair or somewhere else entirely. Therefore, we cannot infer that the jacket is draped over the chair based on these premises alone.\n\nAnswer: No",
