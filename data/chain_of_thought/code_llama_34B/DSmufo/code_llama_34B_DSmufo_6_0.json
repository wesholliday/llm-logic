Premise 1 does not contradict Premise 2.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nWe cannot infer \"The phone is in the living room\" from the given premises. The premises only tell us that the phone is not in the kitchen, but they do not provide any information about its location in the living room. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: No",
