The statement \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" simply means that there is a possibility that Mary was not present at the wedding. It does not rule out the possibility that she was indeed present.\n\nTo infer that it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding, we would need additional information or evidence to support this conclusion. For example, if we know that Mary had a prior commitment on the day of the wedding and could not attend, then it would be reasonable to conclude that she was not present at the wedding. However, without this additional information, we cannot infer that it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No",
