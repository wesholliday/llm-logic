The fact that the vampire did not attack the woman suggests that it may have been asleep or in a state of hibernation, but it does not necessarily follow that it must have been awake. It is possible that the vampire was simply in a state of dormancy and did not pose an immediate threat to the woman. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the vampire must have been awake.\n\nAnswer: No",
