The first premise states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy would go to the zoo. However, this does not mean that if Lucy did go to the zoo, then Joe must have gone to the park. There could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo, and we cannot conclude that Joe went to the park based solely on this information.\n\nStep 3: Answer the question.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot conclude 'Joe went to the park' based on the given premises.",
