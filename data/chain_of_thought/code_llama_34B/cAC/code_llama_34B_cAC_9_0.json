The second premise is a statement of fact, which is true by definition.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the argument.\nThe argument is invalid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The first premise only states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark would buy the blue shirt. It does not state that Lisa actually bought the red shirt. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt based on these premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
