The second premise states that it's not the case that the wug must be garpled, which implies that the wug is not garpled.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nBased on the information provided in the premises, we can conclude that the wug is sproinged because it's not garpled. However, this conclusion does not necessarily follow logically from the premises. The first premise only states that either the wug must be garpled or it is sproinged, which means that there is no guarantee that the wug is sproinged if it's not garpled.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The wug is sproinged' from the given premises. While the second premise implies that the wug is not garpled, there is no logical connection between being not garpled and being sproinged. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.",
