The second premise states that it's not the case that the wug must be bimmed, which implies that the wug is not bimmed.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nBased on the information provided in the premises, we can infer that the wug is flooped because it's not bimmed and there are only two options: either the wug must be bimmed or it is flooped. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
