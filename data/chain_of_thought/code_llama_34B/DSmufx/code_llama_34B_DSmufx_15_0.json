The second premise states that it's not the case that the dreb must be spened, which implies that the dreb is not spened.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nBased on the information provided in the premises, we can conclude that the dreb is vroombed because it cannot be spened and it is not the case that it must be spened. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
