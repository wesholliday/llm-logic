Premise 2 is a negation of a statement, which is also a valid form of reasoning. Therefore, both premises are valid.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The first premise states that either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed, but the second premise states that the grommet is not plopped. This does not necessarily mean that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The grommet is sploffed' from the given argument.",
