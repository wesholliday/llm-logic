Premise 2 is a negation, which is also a valid form of reasoning. Therefore, both premises are logically valid.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\nThe conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises only tell us that either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled, but they do not provide any information about whether the flob is actually skizzled. Therefore, we cannot infer that the flob is skizzled based on these premises alone.\n\nAnswer: No",
