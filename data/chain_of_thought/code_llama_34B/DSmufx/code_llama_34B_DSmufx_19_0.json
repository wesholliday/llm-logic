The second premise states that it's not the case that the smonk must be plagged, which implies that the smonk is not plagged.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nBased on the information provided in the premises, we can infer that the smonk is vreebled because it's not plagged. However, this inference does not necessarily mean that the smonk is vreebled. It's possible that the smonk could be neither plagged nor vreebled.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the smonk is vreebled based on the given premises.",
