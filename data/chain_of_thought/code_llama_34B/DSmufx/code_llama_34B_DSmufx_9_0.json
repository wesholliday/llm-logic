The second premise states that it's not the case that the twonk must be plinked, which implies that the twonk is not plinked.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nBased on the information provided in the premises, we can infer that the twonk is varnished because it cannot be plinked. However, this inference does not necessarily mean that the twonk must be varnished. It's possible that the twonk could be neither varnished nor plinked.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The twonk is varnished' from the given premises.",
