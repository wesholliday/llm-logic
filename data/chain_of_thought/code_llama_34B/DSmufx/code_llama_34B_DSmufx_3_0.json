(negation)\nConclusion: The splat is morphed (affirmative statement)\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\nThe argument is valid because the premises logically entail the conclusion. If the splat must be quanked or it is morphed, and it's not the case that the splat must be quanked, then it must be the case that the splat is morphed.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer 'The splat is morphed' from the given premises.",
