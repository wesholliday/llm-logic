The second premise states that it's not the case that the fribble must be crinked, which implies that the fribble is not crinked.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nBased on the information provided in the premises, we can infer that the fribble is snurgled because it's not crinked. Therefore, the conclusion \"The fribble is snurgled\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
