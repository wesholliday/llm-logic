Premise 2 is a negative statement, which is also valid.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nUsing modus ponens, we can deduce that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball. Therefore, we can infer that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
