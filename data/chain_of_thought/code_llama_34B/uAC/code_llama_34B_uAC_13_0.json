If the first premise is true, and the second premise is also true, then the conclusion must be true.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the premises are true.\nWe do not know whether the car was red or not. However, we can infer that if the car was not red, then the truck would not have been blue either.\n\nAnswer: No",
