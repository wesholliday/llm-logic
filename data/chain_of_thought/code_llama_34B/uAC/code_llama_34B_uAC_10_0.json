The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nStep 3: Explain why the argument is invalid.\nThe argument is invalid because it uses the principle of identity, which states that \"A is B\" implies \"B is A.\" However, this principle only applies when the terms \"A\" and \"B\" are identical. In this case, \"the dog was inside\" and \"the cat was outside\" are not identical, so the argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: No",
