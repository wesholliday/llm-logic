The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The premises only state that Erin took a train, and do not provide any information about Sam's transportation method. Therefore, we cannot infer that Sam took a plane based on these premises alone.\n\nStep 3: Provide an answer to the question.\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that Sam took a plane based on the given premises.",
