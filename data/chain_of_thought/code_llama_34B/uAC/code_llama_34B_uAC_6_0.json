(Statement)\n\nStep 2: Determine if the information is sufficient to make a conclusion.\n\n* The condition states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob would choose pasta. However, it does not state what Bob's choice actually was. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Sue chose pizza based solely on this information.\n\nStep 3: Consider alternative possibilities.\n\n* It is possible that Bob chose something other than pasta, in which case the condition would not be met and we could not infer that Sue chose pizza.\n\nAnswer: No",
