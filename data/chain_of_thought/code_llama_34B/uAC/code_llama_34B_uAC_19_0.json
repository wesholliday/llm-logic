The first premise states that if Tom watched football, then Jen would watch basketball. However, this does not mean that if Jen did watch basketball, then Tom must have watched football. There is no logical connection between the two statements.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question based on the evaluation of the argument.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that Tom watched football. The argument is invalid, and the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.",
