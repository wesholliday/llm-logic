The premise assumes that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was also in the forest, and the conclusion assumes that if the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was also in the forest. However, this does not logically follow, as there is no evidence to support the assumption that the presence of one creature in the forest implies the presence of the other.",
