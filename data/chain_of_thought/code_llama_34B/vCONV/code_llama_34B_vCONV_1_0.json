The premise assumes that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding, and the conclusion assumes that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding. However, this creates an infinite loop where the premise relies on the conclusion, and the conclusion relies on the premise, creating a circular argument.",
