The premise assumes that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo, and the conclusion assumes that if Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park. This creates a loop where the premise relies on the conclusion and vice versa, making it impossible to determine whether either statement is true or false without additional information.",
