The second premise states that either the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box, which implies that if the toy is not sitting on the bookshelf, it must be in the toy box.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nBased on the premises, we can infer that if the toy is not sitting on the bookshelf, it must be in the toy box. Therefore, the conclusion \"The toy is in the toy box\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
