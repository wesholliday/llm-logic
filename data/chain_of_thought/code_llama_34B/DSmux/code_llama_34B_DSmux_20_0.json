(negation)\nConclusion: The fleeg is bluttered (affirmative statement)\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\nThe argument is valid because it follows a logical pattern. If either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned, and it's not the case that the fleeg must be surned, then it must be the case that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nStep 4: Determine whether the argument is sound.\n\nThe argument is sound because the premises are true. If the premises are false, the conclusion may not be true. However, we don't have enough information to determine whether the premises are true or false.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
