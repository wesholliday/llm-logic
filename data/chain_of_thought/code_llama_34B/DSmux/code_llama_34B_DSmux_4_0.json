The second premise is a negation, which means it is true if the statement it negates is false.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nThe conclusion \"The fribble is snurgled\" can be inferred from the first premise if the second premise is false, which means that the fribble must be crinked. However, since the second premise is true (it's not the case that the fribble must be crinked), we cannot infer that the conclusion \"The fribble is snurgled\" follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
