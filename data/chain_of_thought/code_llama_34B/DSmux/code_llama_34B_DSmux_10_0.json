The second premise is a negation, which means it is true only if the opposite of what it states is false.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nBased on the first premise, we know that either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled. If the wug is not garpled, then it must be sproinged. However, based on the second premise, we know that the wug cannot be garpled. Therefore, the conclusion \"The wug is sproinged\" follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
