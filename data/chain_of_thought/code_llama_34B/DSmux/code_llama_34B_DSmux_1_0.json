(negation)\nConclusion: The flugel is blimmed (affirmative statement)\n\nStep 3: Evaluate each premise and determine if it is true.\n\nPremise 1: True (assuming \"blimmed\" and \"zargled\" are mutually exclusive)\nPremise 2: True (assuming the negation of \"must be zargled\" is equivalent to \"is not blimmed\")\n\nStep 4: Determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nYes, the conclusion logically follows from the premises. If the flugel is not zargled (premise 2), and either it is blimmed or it must be zargled (premise 1), then it must be blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
