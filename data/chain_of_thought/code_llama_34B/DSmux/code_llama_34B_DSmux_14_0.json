Premise 2 is an affirmative conclusion based on the negation of a conditional statement, which is also a valid form of reasoning.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nBased on the premises, we can infer that the clug is either fleeked or snugged. However, since it's not the case that the clug must be snugged, we cannot conclude that the clug is fleeked. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
