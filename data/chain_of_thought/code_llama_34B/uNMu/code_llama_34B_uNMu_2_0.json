The statement \"The griffin was seen by many people\" implies that the griffin was present and visible to multiple individuals, which suggests that it was likely in a populated area such as a forest. Additionally, the fact that the griffin was described as a \"large creature with wings\" further supports the idea that it was in a forest or other open area where it could have been seen by many people.",
