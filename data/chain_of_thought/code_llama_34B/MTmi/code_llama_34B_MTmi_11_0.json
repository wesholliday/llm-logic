The first premise states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry. However, the second premise only states that the muffins might not have been blueberry, without specifying whether the cake was chocolate or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that the cake was not chocolate based on these premises alone.\n\nAnswer: No",
