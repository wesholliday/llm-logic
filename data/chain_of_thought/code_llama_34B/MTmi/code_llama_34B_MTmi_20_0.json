The first premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. However, the second premise only suggests that the banana might not have been yellow. It does not provide any information about the color of the apple. Therefore, we cannot infer that the apple was not red based solely on these two premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
