The first premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest. However, this does not mean that if the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest. There is no logical connection between the two statements.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The griffin was not in the forest' from the given premises.",
