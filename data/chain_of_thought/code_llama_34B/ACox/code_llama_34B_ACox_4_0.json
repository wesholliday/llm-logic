The first premise states that the fribble crinked, while the second premise states that if the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked. However, there is no direct evidence in either premise to suggest that the fribble was actually snurgled. Therefore, we cannot draw a conclusion about whether the fribble was snurgled or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
