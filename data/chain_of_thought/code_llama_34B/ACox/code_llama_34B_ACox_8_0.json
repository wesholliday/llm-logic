The statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" implies a causal relationship between the two events, but it does not guarantee that the sprocket was cranked. It is possible that the sprocket was already in a state of being daggled before it was cranked, or that some other factor caused the sprocket to become daggled. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the sprocket was cranked based solely on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No",
