The first premise states that the fribble was crinked, while the second premise is a conditional statement that if the fribble was snurgled, then it would be crinked. However, there is no direct evidence to suggest that the fribble was snurgled. Therefore, we cannot draw a conclusion about the fribble's state based solely on these two premises.",
