Modus ponens is a valid argument form that takes the following structure:\n\nPremise 1: If A, then B.\nPremise 2: A.\nConclusion: B.\n\nIn this case, Premise 1 states that if the splat was morphed, then it would be quanked. Premise 2 states that the splat was quanked. Therefore, based on the validity of the argument form, we can infer that the splat was morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
