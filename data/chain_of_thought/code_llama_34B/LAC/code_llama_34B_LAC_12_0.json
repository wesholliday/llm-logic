The first premise states that if Joe goes to the park, then Lucy will go to the zoo. However, this does not mean that if Lucy goes to the zoo, then Joe must have gone to the park. There could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo, and we cannot infer that Joe went to the park just because Lucy did.\n\nStep 3: Answer the question.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot logically infer \"Joe went to the park\" from the given premises.",
