We are given the premise \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This means that whenever the dog is inside, the cat is outside.\n2. We are also given the fact \"The cat was outside.\"\n3. From these two pieces of information, we can logically infer that the dog must have been inside. If the cat was outside and the dog was inside, then the premise would be true. Therefore, we can conclude that the dog was indeed inside.",
