Therefore, Sue chose pizza. (Conclusion)\n\nWe can infer that Sue chose pizza because the argument is structured as a conditional statement. The first premise states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob would have chosen pasta. Since we know that Bob did choose pasta (second premise), we can logically conclude that Sue must have chosen pizza.",
