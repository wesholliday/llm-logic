In this case, the premises are both true, so the argument is valid.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\nYes, the conclusion logically follows from the premises. If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow, since the two statements are equivalent.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
