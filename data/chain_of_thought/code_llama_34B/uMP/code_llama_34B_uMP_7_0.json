It is not a reliable basis for inference.\n\nPremise 2 is a positive statement that Alex finished the race. This premise is valid and provides evidence that Alex completed the race.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion based on the validity of the premises.\n\nSince Premise 1 is invalid, we cannot infer that Chris finished the race. Therefore, the argument is not sound.\n\nAnswer: No",
