The first premise is a conditional statement that expresses a cause-and-effect relationship between the color of the car and the color of the truck. The second premise is a simple statement about the color of the car.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is logically sound.\nYes, the argument is logically sound because both premises are valid and the conclusion follows necessarily from them. If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue, based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
