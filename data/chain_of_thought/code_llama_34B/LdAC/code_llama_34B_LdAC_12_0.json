However, in this case, we cannot deduce \"Joe went to the park\" with certainty because the premises do not provide enough information to establish a direct causal relationship between Joe's visit to the park and Lucy's visit to the zoo.\n\nStep 3: Consider alternative explanations for the available evidence.\n\nIt is possible that Lucy visited the zoo independently of Joe, or that someone else visited the park and the zoo. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce \"Joe went to the park\" based on the available information.\n\nAnswer: No",
