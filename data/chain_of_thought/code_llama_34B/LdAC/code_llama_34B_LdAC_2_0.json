The second premise simply states that the unicorn was in the forest. Therefore, the premises are logically consistent.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nThe conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises. The first premise only implies that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn must also be in the forest. It does not guarantee that the griffin will be in the forest if the unicorn is. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce that the griffin was in the forest based on these premises alone.\n\nAnswer: No",
