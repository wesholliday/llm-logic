Therefore, Sue chose pizza. (Conclusion)\n\nWe can deduce the conclusion from the premises using modus ponens, which is a valid logical rule. Modus ponens states that if we know that \"if A then B\" and we also know that A, then we can logically deduce B. In this case, A is \"Sue chose pizza\" and B is \"Bob chose pasta\". We know that \"if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" (premise 1) and we also know that Bob chose pasta (premise 2). Therefore, we can logically deduce that Sue chose pizza.",
