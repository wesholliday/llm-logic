The statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" only implies a correlation between the two events, but it does not establish a causal relationship between them. It is possible for the sprocket to be cranked without being daggled, or for the sprocket to be daggled without being cranked. Therefore, we cannot conclude that if the sprocket was not daggled, then it was not cranked.",
