However, it does not imply that if the flob did not move, then it was not skizzled. There could be other factors that caused the flob to not move, such as being tired or feeling uninspired.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the flob did not movate, then the flob was not skizzled\" from the given statement.",
