Therefore, Ben ate pasta (conclusion)\n\nFrom the first premise, we can infer that if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate would not have eaten salad. However, since we know that Kate did eat salad (second premise), it must be the case that Ben did eat pasta. Therefore, we can logically conclude that Ben ate pasta.",
