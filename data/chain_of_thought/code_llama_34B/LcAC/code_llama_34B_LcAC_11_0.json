The first premise states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. However, it does not state that if the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the cake was chocolate based solely on the information provided in the argument.\n\nAnswer: No",
