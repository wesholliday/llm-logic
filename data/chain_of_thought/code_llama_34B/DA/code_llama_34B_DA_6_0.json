The first premise states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob would have chosen pasta. The second premise states that Sue did not choose pizza. Therefore, we can conclude that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nStep 3: Determine the answer to the question.\nBased on the valid argument and the given information, we can infer that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
