However, since we know that Joe did not go to the park (second premise), we cannot conclude that Lucy went to the zoo. In fact, we can infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo either.\n\nStep 3: Draw the conclusion.\nBased on our analysis of the premises, we can conclude that Lucy did not go to the zoo. Therefore, the answer is \"yes.\"",
