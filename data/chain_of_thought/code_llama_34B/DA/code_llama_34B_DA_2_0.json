The first premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. However, the second premise states that the griffin was not in the forest. This means that the first premise is irrelevant to the conclusion, and we cannot infer that the unicorn was not in the forest based solely on these two premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
