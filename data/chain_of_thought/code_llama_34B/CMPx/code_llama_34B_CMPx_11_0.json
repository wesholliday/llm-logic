    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trenist, a lanken, and a draloid are shortlisted for Drij of the Year. The trenist is considered the front runner, followed by the lanken, while the draloid is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates in contention, if the lanken doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the trenist doesn\u2019t win it, the draloid will win it. Moreover, the trenist likely will win the award and hence the lanken likely won\u2019t win it. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trenist doesn\u2019t win Drij of the Year, the draloid will?",

This means that they are the most likely candidate to win the award.\n2. If the trenist doesn't win Drij of the Year, it's possible that the lanken could still win it.\n3. Since the draloid is a long shot to win Drij of the Year, it's unlikely that they will win it if the trenist doesn't win it.\n4. Therefore, it's not likely that the draloid will win Drij of the Year if the trenist doesn't win it.",
