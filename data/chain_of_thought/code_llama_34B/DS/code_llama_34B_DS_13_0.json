The second premise states that the toy isn't sitting on the shelf, which implies that the toy must be in the toy box if it is not sitting on the shelf.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nBased on the information provided, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box because it cannot be in both places at once and it is not sitting on the shelf. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
