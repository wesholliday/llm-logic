This statement is logically consistent.\n\nThe second premise states that the book isn't resting on the table, which implies that the book must be in one of the other possible locations, such as on the shelf or somewhere else. This statement is also logically consistent.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nBased on the premises, we can infer that the book is not resting on the table. However, this does not necessarily mean that the book is on the shelf. The book could be in some other location, such as on a different surface or in someone's hand. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that the book is on the shelf based solely on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
