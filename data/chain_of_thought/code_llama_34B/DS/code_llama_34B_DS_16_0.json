The statement \"Either the pen is in my bag or it is on my desk\" means that the pen cannot be in any other location except for either my bag or my desk.\n2. The statement \"The pen isn't on my desk\" implies that the pen is not located on my desk, which means it must be in another location.\n3. Since we have already established that the only two possible locations for the pen are my bag and my desk, and we have ruled out one of those locations (my desk), the only remaining possibility is that the pen is in my bag. Therefore, we can infer that \"The pen is in my bag.\"",
