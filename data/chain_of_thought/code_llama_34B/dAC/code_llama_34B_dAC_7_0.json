Therefore, Alex finished the race (conclusion)\n\nIn this argument, we are using the principle of modus ponens to deduce that Alex finished the race. Modus ponens is a valid logical rule that allows us to deduce a conclusion from two premises, where one premise is the conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and the other premise is the statement \"A\". By applying this rule, we can conclude that Alex finished the race.",
