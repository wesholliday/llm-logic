The first premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn would be in the forest. However, it does not state that the griffin must be in the forest for the unicorn to be there. Therefore, we cannot deduce that the griffin was in the forest based solely on these premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
