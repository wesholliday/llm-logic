If the apple was not red, then it cannot be the case that the banana was yellow, since the premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana would be yellow. Therefore, we can infer that the banana was not yellow.\n\nStep 3: Answer the question.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that the banana was not yellow based on the given argument.",
