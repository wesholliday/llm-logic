The conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is sound.\n\nThe argument is sound because the premises are true. If the car was not red, then it cannot be inferred that the truck was blue. Therefore, the conclusion \"The truck was not blue\" is false.\n\nAnswer: No",
