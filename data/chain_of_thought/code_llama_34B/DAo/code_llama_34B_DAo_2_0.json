The second premise is an if-then statement, which is also logically consistent.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nUsing modus ponens, we can deduce that the unicorn was not in the forest. This is because if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn would also be in the forest (according to the second premise). Since the griffin is not in the forest (according to the first premise), we can conclude that the unicorn is not in the forest.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that the unicorn was not in the forest based on the given information.",
