It does not imply that additional physical activity, such as hard labor, will negate the benefits of sleep. In fact, hard labor can actually increase the need for sleep and lead to fatigue if not enough sleep is obtained. Therefore, it is not accurate to infer that \"If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired.\"",
