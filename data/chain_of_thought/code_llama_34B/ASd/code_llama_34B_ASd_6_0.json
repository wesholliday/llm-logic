However, adding the condition \"and I am wearing earplugs\" does not change this fact. Even if the speaker is wearing earplugs, they will still be affected by the screaming sound, as the earplugs are designed to reduce the volume of sounds but not eliminate them completely. Therefore, the statement \"If you scream and I am wearing earplugs, it will hurt my ears\" is a true statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
