The statement \"If the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today\" is not logically implied by the premise \"If the package has shipped, then it will arrive today.\"\n\nHere's why:\n\nThe first premise states that if a package has shipped, then it will arrive today. This means that the package is on its way to the destination and should arrive sometime today.\n\nHowever, the second premise adds an additional condition - that the package was misrouted. This means that the package did not take the expected route and may be delayed or lost.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the package will arrive today just because it has shipped and was misrouted. The misrouting could cause further delays or even prevent the package from arriving altogether.\n\nAnswer: No",
