The statement \"If the match is struck, then it will light\" only implies a causal relationship between striking the match and it lighting up. It does not take into account any external factors that may affect the outcome, such as the match being wet.\n\nIn this case, if the match has been soaked in water, it may not be able to produce a flame when struck, regardless of whether it is dry or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the match is struck and it has been soaked in water, then it will light.",
