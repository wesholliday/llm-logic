The original statement only implies a correlation between the quality of the essay and the grade received, not a causal relationship. It is possible that the instructor may take into account other factors such as lateness when determining the grade, even if the essay is well-written. Therefore, it is not safe to assume that getting an A is guaranteed simply because the essay is well-written and turned in late.",
