The statement \"If I fertilize the lawn, it will be lush and green\" does not imply that the lawn will still be lush and green in the presence of a drought. In fact, a drought can actually harm the lawn by reducing the amount of water available to it. Therefore, it is possible that fertilizing the lawn may not have any effect on its appearance if there is a drought present.",
