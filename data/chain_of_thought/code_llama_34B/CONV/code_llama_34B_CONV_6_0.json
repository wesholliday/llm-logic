The statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" implies a causal relationship between the two choices, but it does not imply that the choices are reciprocal or that one choice is the cause of the other. It is possible for Bob to choose pasta without Sue choosing pizza, and vice versa. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza.",
