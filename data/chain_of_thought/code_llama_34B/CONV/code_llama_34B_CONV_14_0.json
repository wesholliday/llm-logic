The statement \"If the bear was in the case, then the wolf was in the den\" is a logical consequence of the premise \"The bear was in the case.\" However, it does not imply that the converse is also true, i.e., \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case.\"\n\nTo see why, consider a counterexample: suppose that the bear was in the case, but the wolf was not in the den. In this case, the premise \"The bear was in the case\" is true, but the conclusion \"The wolf was in the den\" is false. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case.\"",
