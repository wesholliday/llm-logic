The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" implies a causal relationship between Mary being at the wedding and Sue being at the wedding. It does not imply that the two statements are equivalent or that one logically follows from the other.\n\nFor example, if we know that \"If it rained, then the streets were wet,\" we cannot infer that \"If the streets were wet, then it rained.\" The first statement implies a causal relationship between rain and wet streets, but the second statement does not imply a causal relationship between wet streets and rain.\n\nTherefore, in the case of the original statement, we cannot infer that \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\"",
