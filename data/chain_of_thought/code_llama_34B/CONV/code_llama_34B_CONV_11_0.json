However, it does not imply that the reverse is also true, i.e., that if the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate.\n\nTo infer the reverse statement, we would need additional information or evidence to support the causal relationship in both directions. For example, if we knew that the baker always used chocolate cake batter to make blueberry muffins, and never used any other type of cake batter, then we could infer that if the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was likely chocolate. However, without this additional information, we cannot infer the reverse statement with certainty.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no, we cannot infer \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate\" from the given statement.",
