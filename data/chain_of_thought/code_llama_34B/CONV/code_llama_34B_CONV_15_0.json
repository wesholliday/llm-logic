The statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" implies that there is a causal relationship between Sam taking a plane and Erin taking a train. However, it does not imply that there is a causal relationship between Erin taking a train and Sam taking a plane.\n\nFor example, it's possible that both Sam and Erin took their respective modes of transportation independently of each other, without any causal connection between them. In this case, we cannot infer that if Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane.",
