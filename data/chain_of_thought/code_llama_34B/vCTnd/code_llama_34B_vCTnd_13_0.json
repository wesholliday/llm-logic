The premise \"If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much\" implies that there is a negative correlation between exercising and exercising much. However, the conclusion \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise\" implies that there is a positive correlation between exercising much and not exercising at all. This is a contradiction, which means that the argument is logically invalid.",
