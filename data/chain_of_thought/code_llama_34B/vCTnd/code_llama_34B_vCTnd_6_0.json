The premise \"If the clothes were washed, then they were not washed properly\" implies that there is a possibility that the clothes were not washed properly, but the conclusion \"If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed\" implies that there is no possibility that the clothes were washed properly. This is a contradiction, and therefore the argument is not logically valid.",
