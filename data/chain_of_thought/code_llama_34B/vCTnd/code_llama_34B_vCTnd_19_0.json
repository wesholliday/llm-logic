It assumes that if directions were provided, they must have been explained clearly, and if they were not explained clearly, then they were not provided. However, this assumption is not necessarily true. It is possible for directions to be provided without being explained clearly, or for directions to be explained clearly without being provided. Therefore, the argument's conclusion does not logically follow from its premise.",
