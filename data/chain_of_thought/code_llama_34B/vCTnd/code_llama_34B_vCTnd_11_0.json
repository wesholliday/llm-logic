The premise \"If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables\" implies that there is a causal relationship between going to the store and not buying vegetables. However, this is not necessarily true. It is possible that I went to the store and bought vegetables, or that I did not go to the store and did not buy vegetables. The conclusion \"If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store\" is therefore not logically valid.",
