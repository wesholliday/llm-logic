The statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" implies a causal relationship between the two events, where cranking the sprocket causes it to become daggled. However, this does not mean that the reverse is also true, i.e., that if the sprocket becomes daggled, it must have been cranked. There could be other factors that caused the sprocket to become daggled, such as wear and tear or external forces. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was cranked.\"",
