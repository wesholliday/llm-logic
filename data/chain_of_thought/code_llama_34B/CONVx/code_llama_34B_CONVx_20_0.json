However, it does not imply that the reverse is also true, i.e., that if the fleeg surned, then it must have been bluttered.\n\nTo infer that \"If the fleeg surned, then it was bluttered,\" we would need additional information or evidence to support this causal relationship in the opposite direction. Without such evidence, we cannot assume that the two events are causally connected.",
