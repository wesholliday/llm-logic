This is because the statement only implies a correlation between the color of the car and the color of the truck, but it does not guarantee that the colors are inverse.\n\nFor example, even if the car is red and the truck is blue, it's still possible that the car could be any other color besides red, such as green or yellow, and the truck could be any other color besides blue, such as green or yellow. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.",
