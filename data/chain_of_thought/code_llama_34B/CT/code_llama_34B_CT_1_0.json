However, it does not imply that if one person is not at the wedding, then the other person is also not at the wedding.\n\nFor example, even if Mary was at the wedding but Sue was not, we cannot infer that Mary caused Sue to not attend the wedding. Similarly, if Sue was at the wedding but Mary was not, we cannot infer that Sue caused Mary to not attend the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\" from the given statement.",
