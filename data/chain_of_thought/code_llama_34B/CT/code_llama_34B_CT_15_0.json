However, it does not imply that if Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane. There could be other factors at play that caused Erin to not take a train, while Sam still took a plane.\n\nFor example, maybe Erin had a car accident and was unable to drive to the train station, but Sam was able to fly without any issues. In this case, it would be incorrect to infer that if Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.",
