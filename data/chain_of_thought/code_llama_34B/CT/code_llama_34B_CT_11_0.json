The statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" implies a causal relationship between the type of cake and the type of muffin. However, it does not imply that the absence of one type of muffin implies the absence of another type of cake.\n\nFor example, even if the muffins were not blueberry, it is still possible that the cake was chocolate. Perhaps there was a different type of muffin that was served with the chocolate cake. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.",
