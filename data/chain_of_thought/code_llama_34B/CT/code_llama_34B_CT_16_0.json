The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" does not imply that if the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton. It is possible for the shirt to be made of a different material than the pants, even if the pants are denim.\n\nFor example, the statement could be true if the shirt was made of silk and the pants were made of denim. In this case, the pants being denim does not imply that the shirt is cotton. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: No",
