This is because the two statements are not logically connected in a way that would allow us to draw such a conclusion.\n\nTo see why, consider the following:\n\n* If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow (premise)\n* The banana was not yellow (negation of conclusion)\n\nFrom these two premises, we cannot logically deduce that the apple was not red. This is because the first premise only tells us about the relationship between the apple and the banana, and does not provide any information about the color of the apple when the banana is not yellow. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.",
