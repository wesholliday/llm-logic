The statement \"If the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk was not plagged\" is a different statement from \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\" The first statement implies that if the smonk was not vreebled, it would not have been plagged, but it does not guarantee that the smonk was not plagged.\n\nTo illustrate this, let's consider an example. If we know that \"If it rains, then the streets are wet,\" we cannot infer that \"If it doesn't rain, then the streets are dry.\" The first statement simply means that if it rains, the streets will be wet, but it does not guarantee that the streets will be dry if it doesn't rain.\n\nTherefore, in the case of the smonk, we cannot infer that \"If the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk was not plagged\" based solely on the statement \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\"",
