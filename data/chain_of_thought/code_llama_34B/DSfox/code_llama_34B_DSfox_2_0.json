If the wug is not bimmed, then either it is bimmed or it is flooped. Since we know that it is not bimmed, it must be the case that it is flooped.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is sound.\n\nThe argument is sound because the premises are true and the conclusion logically follows from them.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
