The conclusion logically follows from the premises, so the argument is valid.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the conclusion is true or false.\n\nWe cannot determine whether the conclusion is true or false based solely on the information provided. The conclusion may be true if the splat is indeed morphed, but it may also be false if the splat is not morphed. Therefore, we need more information to determine the truth value of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No",
