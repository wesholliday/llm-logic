In this case, the first premise is a disjunction (either-or) statement, and the second premise is a negation (not) statement. If we assume that the book is not resting on the table, then it must be either on the shelf or not in the room at all. Since we are given that the book is in the room, it follows that it must be on the shelf. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.",
