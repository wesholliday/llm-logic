The first premise states that either the toy is in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf, and the second premise states that the toy isn't sitting on the shelf. Therefore, if the toy isn't sitting on the shelf, it must be in the toy box. This conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument valid.",
