    "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it\u2019s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be. Moreover, it\u2019s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",

            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the premises of the argument\nThe argument states that apples are the most purchased fruits and that bananas are closely behind. It also mentions that oranges trail distantly behind these two fruits.\n\nStep 2: Identify the conclusion of the argument\nThe conclusion of the argument is that if apples aren't the top-selling fruit, then oranges will be.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the reasoning of the argument\nThe reasoning of the argument is based on the idea that if bananas are not the top-selling fruit, then either apples or oranges must be. However, this reasoning is flawed because it does not take into account the possibility that some other fruit could be the top-selling fruit. For example, if a new type of fruit becomes popular and outsells both apples and bananas, then neither apples nor oranges would be the top-selling fruit.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\nBased on the flawed reasoning of the argument, it does not follow that it is likely that if apples aren't the top-selling fruit, oranges will be. Therefore, the answer is no.",
