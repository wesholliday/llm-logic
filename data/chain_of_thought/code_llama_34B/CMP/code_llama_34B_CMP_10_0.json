    "user_prompt": "Suppose that spring, summer, and winter are the most popular travel seasons. Forecasts show it's likely most vacations this year will happen in spring, followed closely by summer, with many fewer happening in the winter. These are by far the top seasons, so if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will. Moreover, spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will?",

The forecast suggests that the majority of vacations this year will take place in spring and summer, with fewer occurring in winter.\n2. The fact that spring is likely to have more travelers than summer means that it is also likely to have more vacations.\n3. Therefore, if spring does not have the most vacations, it is unlikely that winter will, as it is unlikely that there would be a significant number of vacations in winter given the forecast and the fact that spring has more travelers than summer.",
