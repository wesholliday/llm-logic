The first premise states that either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge, and the second premise states that it's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can conclude that the milk is on the counter.\n\nThe argument is also logically consistent because it doesn't lead to any contradictions or false statements. The conclusion follows logically from the premises, and there are no other possible conclusions that could be drawn from the same set of premises. Therefore, this form of argument is considered logically valid.",
