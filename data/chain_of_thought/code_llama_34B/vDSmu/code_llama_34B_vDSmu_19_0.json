The first premise states that either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist, but the second premise states that it's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist. This means that the only remaining possibility is that the watch is charging on the dresser, which is not a valid conclusion. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.",
