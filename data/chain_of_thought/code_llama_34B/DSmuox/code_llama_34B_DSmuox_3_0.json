We are told that \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked.\" This means that the splat does not have to be quanked.\n\nStep 2: Now, let's consider the second piece of information: \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked.\" This statement suggests that either the splat is morphed or it has to be quanked.\n\nStep 3: Based on the above two statements, we can conclude that the splat may or may not be morphed. However, since it does not have to be quanked, it is possible that the splat is not morphed.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, we cannot infer \"The splat is morphed\" from the given information. The correct answer is 'no'.",
