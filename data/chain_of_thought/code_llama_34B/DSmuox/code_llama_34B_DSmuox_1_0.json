The first premise states that the flugel does not have to be zargled, which means it could still be zargled or not zargled. The second premise provides an alternative possibility that the flugel could be blimmed instead of being zargled. However, this does not necessarily mean that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the flugel is blimmed based on the given premises.",
