These two premises are logically consistent with each other because they do not contradict each other.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nThe conclusion \"The dreb is vroombed\" does not follow logically from the premises. The first premise states that the dreb does not have to be spened, which means it could still be spened or not spened. The second premise states that either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened, but it does not provide any information about whether the dreb is actually vroombed. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the dreb is vroombed based on these premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
