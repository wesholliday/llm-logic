These two statements do not directly contradict each other, so we cannot immediately conclude that the conclusion is false.\n\nStep 3: Consider alternative possibilities and evaluate their consistency with the premises.\n\nOne possible alternative is that the fribble is neither snurgled nor crinked. However, this alternative is not consistent with Premise 2, which states that either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked. Therefore, we can rule out this alternative.\n\nAnother possible alternative is that the fribble is both snurgled and crinked. This alternative is also not consistent with Premise 1, which states that the fribble is not necessarily crinked. Therefore, we can also rule out this alternative.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion based on the evaluation of the premises and alternatives.\n\nBased on our analysis, we have determined that the only consistent alternative with the premises is that the fribble is snurgled. Therefore, we can conclude that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
