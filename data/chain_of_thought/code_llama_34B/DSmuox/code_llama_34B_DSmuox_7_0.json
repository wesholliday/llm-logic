These two statements do not necessarily conflict with each other, as the whiffle could be both not tinked and not shanked.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe conclusion that the whiffle is shanked does not logically follow from the premises. The first premise only states that the whiffle does not have to be tinked, while the second premise suggests that either the whiffle is shanked or it must be tinked. There is no guarantee that the whiffle is shanked based on these premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
