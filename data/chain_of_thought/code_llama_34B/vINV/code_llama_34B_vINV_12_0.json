The premise \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" implies that there is a causal relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo. However, this is not necessarily true. It is possible for Lucy to go to the zoo even if Joe does not go to the park. Therefore, the conclusion \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo\" is not logically valid.",
