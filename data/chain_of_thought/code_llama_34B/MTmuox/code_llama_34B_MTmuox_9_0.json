The argument commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent, which is an informal fallacy that involves concluding that a cause must have existed based on the existence of an effect, without establishing a causal relationship between the two. In this case, just because the twonk was not varnished does not mean it could not have been plinked.\n\nAnswer: No",
