The first premise states that the wug may or may not have been garpled, while the second premise implies that if the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled. However, there is no guarantee that the wug was sproinged in the first place. Therefore, we cannot infer that the wug was not sproinged based on these premises.\n\nStep 3: Answer the question.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the wug was not sproinged based on the given premises.",
