Premise 2 is a conditional statement, and it is also considered to be valid as long as the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is true.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion based on the premises.\n\nThe conclusion states that the dreb was not vroombed. This conclusion can be inferred from the premises if we assume that the premises are true and that the antecedent of Premise 2 is false. In other words, if the dreb was not vroombed, then it cannot have been spened, which means that Premise 1 is true. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
