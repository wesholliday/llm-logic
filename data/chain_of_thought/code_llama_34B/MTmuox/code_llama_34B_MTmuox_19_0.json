            "content": "\nStep 1: Identify the negation in the premises.\n\nThe first premise is \"It's not the case that the smonk must have plagged.\" This sentence can be negated by adding a \"not\" to the front, resulting in \"It is not the case that the smonk must have plagged.\"\n\nStep 2: Identify the conclusion.\n\nThe conclusion is \"The smonk was not vreebled.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine if the argument is valid or invalid.\n\nThis argument is invalid because the premises do not logically imply the conclusion. The first premise states that the smonk did not plagiarize, but it does not say anything about whether the smonk was vreebled or not. The second premise states that if the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagiarized, but this does not mean that if the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk did not plagiarize. Therefore, we cannot infer that the smonk was not vreebled based on these premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
