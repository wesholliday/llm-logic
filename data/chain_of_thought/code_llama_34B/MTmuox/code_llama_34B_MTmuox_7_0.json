The second premise is \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked.\" This sentence can be translated to \"If the whiffle was not shanked, then the whiffle did not tink,\" which is also a negative statement.\n\nStep 2: Identify the conclusion.\n\nThe conclusion we want to draw from these premises is \"The whiffle was not shanked.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is valid or invalid.\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion does logically follow from the premises, so the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
