The first premise states that the fribble did not crink, but it does not say anything about whether the fribble was snurgled or not. The second premise states that if the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked, but it does not provide any information about what happened to the fribble if it was not snurgled. Therefore, we cannot infer that the fribble was not snurgled based on these premises.\n\nStep 3: Answer the question.\n\nAnswer: No.",
