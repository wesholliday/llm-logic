The first premise states that the clug did not have to be snugged, which does not necessarily mean that it was not fleeked. The second premise states that if the clug was fleeked, then it had to be snugged, but this does not provide any information about whether the clug was actually fleeked or not. Therefore, we cannot draw a conclusion about the fleeking status of the clug based on these premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
