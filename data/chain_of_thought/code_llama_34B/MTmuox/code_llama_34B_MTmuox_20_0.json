            "content": "\nStep 1: Identify the negation in the premises.\n\nThe first premise is \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned.\" This sentence is in the form of a negation, so we can infer that the fleeg was not surned.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the conditional statement in the second premise.\n\nThe second premise is \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true, then the consequent (the part after the \"then\") must also be true.\n\nStep 3: Apply modus tollens.\n\nWe can use modus tollens to infer that the fleeg was not bluttered. Modus tollens is a logical rule that allows us to deduce the negation of the antecedent from the negation of the consequent, provided that the conditional statement is true. In this case, we have the negation of the consequent (the fleeg was not surned), and we can use modus tollens to infer that the antecedent (the fleeg was bluttered) must also be false.\n\nStep 4: Conclude the argument.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
