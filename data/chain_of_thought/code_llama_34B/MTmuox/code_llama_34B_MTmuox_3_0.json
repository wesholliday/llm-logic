The first premise only tells us that the splat did not quank, but it does not provide any information about whether the splat was morphed or not. The second premise tells us that if the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked, but it does not tell us anything about what happened to the splat if it was not morphed. Therefore, we cannot draw a conclusion about whether the splat was morphed or not based on these premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
