If the job was completed, then it was not completed well. This means that the job was either incomplete or poorly done.\n2. If the job was completed well, then it was not completed. This implies that the job was either not finished or not done properly.\n3. However, there is no guarantee that the job was not completed at all. It's possible that the job was completed but not well.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the job was completed well, then it was not completed. The two statements are not logically equivalent.",
