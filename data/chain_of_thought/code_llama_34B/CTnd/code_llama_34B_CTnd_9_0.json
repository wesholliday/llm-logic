The two statements are not logically equivalent.\n\nHere's why:\n\nThe first statement \"If instructions were given, then they were not explained clearly\" implies that there is a possibility that instructions were given but they were not explained clearly. This does not necessarily mean that instructions were not given at all. It simply means that the explanation was not clear enough.\n\nOn the other hand, the second statement \"If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given\" implies that if instructions were explained clearly, then it is certain that instructions were not given. This is a stronger claim than the first statement, and it is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given based on the information provided in the first statement.",
