The two statements are not logically equivalent.\n\nHere's why:\n\nThe first statement \"If directions were provided, then they were not explained clearly\" means that if someone provides directions, it does not necessarily mean that the directions are clear or easy to understand. It could be that the person providing the directions is not very good at explaining things, or that the listener is not paying attention, or that there are other factors that make the directions unclear.\n\nThe second statement \"If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided\" means that if someone explains directions clearly, it does not necessarily mean that they also provided directions. It could be that the person explaining the directions is simply clarifying something that was already provided by someone else, or that they are providing a different kind of explanation altogether (e.g., a visual representation of the directions).\n\nSo while there may be some relationship between the two statements, we cannot infer one from the other without additional information.",
