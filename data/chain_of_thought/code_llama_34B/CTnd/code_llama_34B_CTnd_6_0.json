The statement \"If the clothes were washed, then they were not washed properly\" implies that the clothes were washed but not properly, which does not necessarily mean that they were not washed at all. It is possible that the clothes were washed but not to the desired standard of cleanliness.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed. The correct answer is \"no\".",
