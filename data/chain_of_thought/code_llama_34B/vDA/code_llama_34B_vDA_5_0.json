The first premise establishes a conditional relationship between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis, but the second premise only states that Jeff did not play basketball. It does not provide any information about Amy's activities, so it cannot be used to infer that Amy did not play tennis. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.",
