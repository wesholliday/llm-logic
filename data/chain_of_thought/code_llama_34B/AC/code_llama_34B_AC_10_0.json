We also know that \"the cat was outside\" (premise 2).\n3. From premise 1 and premise 2, we can infer that \"the dog was inside\". This is because if the dog was not inside, then the cat would not have been outside, which contradicts our knowledge that the cat was outside. Therefore, we can conclude that the dog must have been inside.",
