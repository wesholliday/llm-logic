For example, if someone says \"I might not have studied for the exam,\" they are expressing uncertainty about whether or not they studied, but they are not asserting that they did not study. Similarly, \"The glip might not have been slogged\" implies that there is some possibility that the glip was not slogged, but it does not necessarily mean that it must have been slogged.",
