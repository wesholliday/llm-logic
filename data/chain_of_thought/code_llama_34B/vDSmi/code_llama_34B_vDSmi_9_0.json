The first premise suggests that either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor, but the second premise provides an alternative possibility: that the missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor. This means that the conclusion of the argument (that the missing puzzle piece is in the box) cannot be logically deduced from the premises.",
