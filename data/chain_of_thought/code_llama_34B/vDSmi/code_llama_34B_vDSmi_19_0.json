The first premise states that either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist, but it does not rule out the possibility that the watch is neither charging on the dresser nor on his wrist. Therefore, the second premise that the watch might not be on his wrist does not necessarily imply that the watch is charging on the dresser.",
