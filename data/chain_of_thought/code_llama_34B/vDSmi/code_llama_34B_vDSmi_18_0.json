The first premise states that either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand, but the second premise only states that the notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand. This means that there is still a possibility that the notebook could be sitting on the nightstand, which contradicts the conclusion that the notebook is in the drawer. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.",
