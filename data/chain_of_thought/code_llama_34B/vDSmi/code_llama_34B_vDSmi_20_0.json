The first premise states that either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head, but it does not rule out the possibility that the sunglasses could be somewhere else entirely. Therefore, the second premise that the sunglasses might not be perched on her head does not necessarily imply that they are in her bag.",
