The first premise states that either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge, but the second premise only rules out one of those options. It does not rule out the possibility that the milk is actually both on the counter and chilling in the fridge at the same time. Therefore, the conclusion that the milk is on the counter cannot be logically deduced from the premises.",
