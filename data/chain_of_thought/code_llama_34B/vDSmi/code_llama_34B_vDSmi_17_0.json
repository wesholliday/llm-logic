The first premise states that either the scarf is stuffed in the backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack, but the second premise only states that the scarf might not be draped on the coat rack. This means that there is still a possibility that the scarf could be draped on the coat rack, which would make the conclusion false. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.",
