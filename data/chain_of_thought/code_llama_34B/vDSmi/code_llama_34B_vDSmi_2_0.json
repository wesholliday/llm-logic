The first premise states that either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table, but the second premise only states that the book might not be resting on the table. This means that there is still a possibility that the book could be resting on the table, which contradicts the conclusion that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.",
