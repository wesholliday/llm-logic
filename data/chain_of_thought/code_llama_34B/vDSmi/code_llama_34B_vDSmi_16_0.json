The first premise states that either the pen is in the bag or it must be on the desk, but the second premise only states that the pen might not be on the desk. This means that there is still a possibility that the pen could be on the desk, which contradicts the conclusion that the pen is in the bag. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.",
