            "content": "\nStep 1: Identify the premises and conclusion.\nThe first premise is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" The second premise is \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\" The conclusion we want to draw is \"Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the premises.\nThe first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy would have gone to the zoo. However, this does not necessarily mean that Lucy's action is dependent on Joe's action. It is possible for Lucy to go to the zoo even if Joe did not go to the park.\n\nThe second premise states that Lucy did not go to the zoo. This contradicts the first premise, as it implies that Lucy did not go to the zoo regardless of whether Joe went to the park or not.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion.\nBased on the analysis of the premises, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park. If Joe had gone to the park, then Lucy would have gone to the zoo, but since Lucy did not go to the zoo, it is likely that Joe did not go to the park either.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
