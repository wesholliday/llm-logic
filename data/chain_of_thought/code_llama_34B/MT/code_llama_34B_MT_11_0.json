The first premise states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. However, the second premise states that the muffins were not blueberry. This does not necessarily mean that the cake was not chocolate. There could be other factors at play that led to the muffins not being blueberry, such as a change in recipe or ingredients.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question based on your evaluation.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The cake was not chocolate' from the given premises.",
