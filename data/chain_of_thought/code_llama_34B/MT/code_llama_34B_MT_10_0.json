The first premise states that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. However, the second premise states that the cat was not outside. This means that the dog could have been either inside or outside, and we cannot infer that it was definitely inside based on the available information.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The dog was inside' from the given premises.",
