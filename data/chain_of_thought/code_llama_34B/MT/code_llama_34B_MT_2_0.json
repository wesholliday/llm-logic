The second premise states that the unicorn was not in the forest, which means that the condition for the first premise to be true (i.e., the presence of the unicorn) is not met.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nBased on the evaluation of the premises, we can conclude that the griffin was not in the forest. This is because the first premise provides a condition for the presence of the unicorn, and since the unicorn was not present, the condition is not met, which means that the griffin was also not present.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
