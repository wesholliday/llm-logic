This implies that there is a causal relationship between Sue's choice and Bob's choice. The second premise states that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion.\nBased on the information provided, we cannot infer that Sue did not choose pizza. If Sue chose pizza, it does not necessarily follow that Bob would have chosen pasta. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Sue did not choose pizza based solely on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
