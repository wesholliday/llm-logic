In this case, the first premise states that if the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked. This premise is valid because it does not contain any contradictory or false statements.\n\nPremise 2 is a statement of fact, which asserts that the fribble was snurgled. This premise is also valid because it does not contain any contradictory or false statements.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion based on the validity of the premises.\n\nBased on the validity of the premises, we can infer that if the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked. Therefore, since the fribble was snurgled (as stated in Premise 2), it follows that the fribble crinked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
