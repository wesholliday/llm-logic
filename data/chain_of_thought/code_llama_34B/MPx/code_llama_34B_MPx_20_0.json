This assumption is necessary for the argument to be valid, as it provides the premise with which we can infer the conclusion.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\nBased on the information provided, the argument is valid. The premise \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" is a logical consequence of the assumption \"The fleeg was bluttered\", so we can infer that the fleeg surned.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
