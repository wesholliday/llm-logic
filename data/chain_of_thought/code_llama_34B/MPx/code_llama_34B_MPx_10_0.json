The conclusion logically follows from the premises if the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is true and the consequent (the \"then\" part) is also true.\n\nPremise 2 is a simple statement that asserts the existence of a certain state of affairs.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is valid or invalid.\n\nThe argument is valid because both premises are true, and the conclusion logically follows from them.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
