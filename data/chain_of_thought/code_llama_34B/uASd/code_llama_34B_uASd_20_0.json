The expiration date of a medication is an indicator of its shelf life and does not necessarily affect its efficacy or safety. However, it is important to note that the quality and potency of a medication can degrade over time, which may affect its effectiveness or even lead to adverse reactions. Therefore, it is generally recommended to discard expired medications and use fresh ones instead.\n\nAnswer: No",
