The inference is not logically valid because the two events (finishing homework and the computer catching on fire) are not causally related. Just because one event occurs (you finishing your homework), it does not mean that another event will occur (your computer catching on fire). Additionally, even if both events were causally related, the inference would still be invalid because the second event (the computer catching on fire) is a negative event, and we cannot infer a positive event (playing video games) from it.",
