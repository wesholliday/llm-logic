The presence of a bomb at the concert does not necessarily guarantee that we will have a good time. In fact, it is likely that the presence of a bomb would make the experience very unpleasant and potentially dangerous. Therefore, it is not accurate to infer that if we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time.",
