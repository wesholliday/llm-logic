While watering is necessary for plant growth, it is not sufficient on its own to guarantee growth. The plants also need access to sunlight in order to undergo photosynthesis, which is the process by which they convert light energy into chemical energy that they can use to grow and thrive. Without sunlight, the plants will not be able to carry out photosynthesis, even if they are watered regularly.",
