The statement \"if the order is placed, then the item will ship\" only implies a causal relationship between the two events, but it does not guarantee that the item will be in stock when the order is placed. If the item is out of stock, it may not be possible to ship it even if the order is placed. Therefore, we need additional information to determine whether the item will ship or not.",
