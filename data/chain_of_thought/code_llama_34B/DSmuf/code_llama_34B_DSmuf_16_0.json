The second premise states that it's not the case that the pen must be on my desk, which implies that the pen is not on my desk.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nBased on the analysis of the premises, we can conclude that the pen is in my bag because it's not on my desk and there are only two possible locations for the pen (on my desk or in my bag). Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
