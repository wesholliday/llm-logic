The statement \"Either the missing sock must be under the bed or it's in the laundry basket\" means that there are only two possible locations for the missing sock: under the bed or in the laundry basket.\n2. The statement \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed\" means that the missing sock is not located under the bed.\n3. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the missing sock must be in the laundry basket.",
