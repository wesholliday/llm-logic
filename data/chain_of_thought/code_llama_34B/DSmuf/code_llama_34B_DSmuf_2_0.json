The second premise states that it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table, which implies that the book is not on the table.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nBased on the analysis of the premises, we can conclude that the book is not on the table and therefore must be on the shelf. Therefore, the conclusion \"The book is on the shelf\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
