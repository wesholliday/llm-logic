The premise assumes that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter, but this assumption is not necessarily true. There could be other reasons why the robot did not visit Jupiter, even if the alien did visit Mars. Therefore, the argument's conclusion does not logically follow from its premises.",
