The first premise assumes that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal, but this assumption is not necessarily true. There could be other factors that determine whether an object is made of plastic or metal, such as its intended use or the availability of materials. Therefore, the conclusion that the doll was not plastic based solely on the premise that the truck must have been metal is not logically valid.",
