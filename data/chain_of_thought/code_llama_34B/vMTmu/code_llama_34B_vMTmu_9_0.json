The first premise implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. However, the second premise states that it's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This means that the conclusion \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" cannot be logically deduced from the premises.",
