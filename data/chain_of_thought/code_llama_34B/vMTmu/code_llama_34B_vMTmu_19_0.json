The first premise implies that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball, but the second premise states that Jen did not watch basketball. This does not necessarily mean that Tom did not watch football. There could be other reasons why Jen did not watch basketball, and Tom still might have watched football. Therefore, the conclusion is not logically supported by the premises.",
