            "content": "Answer: No. The argument is not logically valid because it uses a faulty inference. The first premise implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. However, the second premise states that it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. This means that the conclusion \"Mary was not at the wedding\" cannot be logically deduced from the premises.",
