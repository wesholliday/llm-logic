The first premise states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race. However, the second premise states that it's not the case that Chris must have finished the race. This means that the conclusion \"Alex did not finish the race\" cannot be logically deduced from the premises. Therefore, the argument is not valid.",
