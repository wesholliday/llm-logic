The statement \"It's not the case that the grommet must have been sploffed\" means that there is no logical necessity for the grommet to have been sploffed. However, this does not mean that it is possible or likely that the grommet was not sploffed. It could still be the case that the grommet was sploffed, but we cannot infer that with certainty based on the information provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is \"no\".",
