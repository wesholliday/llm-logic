The statement \"It's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed\" means that there is no logical necessity for the flugel to have been blimmed. However, this does not mean that it is possible or likely that the flugel was not blimmed. It could still be the case that the flugel was blimmed, but we cannot infer that with certainty based on the information provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no, we cannot infer that the flugel might not have been blimmed.",
