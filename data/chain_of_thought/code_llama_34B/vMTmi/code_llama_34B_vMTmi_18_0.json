The first premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the truck might not have been metal, then the doll was not plastic. There could be other factors at play that would make the doll plastic even if the truck was not metal. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that the doll was not plastic based solely on the information provided in this argument.",
