The first premise states that if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside. However, the second premise states that the cat might not have been outside. This means that there is no guarantee that the cat was outside, even if the dog was inside. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the dog was not inside based solely on these two premises.",
