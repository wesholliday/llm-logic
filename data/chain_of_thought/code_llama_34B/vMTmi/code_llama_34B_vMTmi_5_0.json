The first premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. However, the second premise states that Amy might not have played tennis. This means that even if Jeff did play basketball, it is still possible that Amy did not play tennis. Therefore, the conclusion that Jeff did not play basketball cannot be logically deduced from the premises.",
