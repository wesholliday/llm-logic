The first premise establishes a conditional relationship between the authorship of the book and its genre, while the second premise simply states that the book might not be a mystery novel. It does not provide any information about the authorship of the book. Therefore, it is possible for the book to have been written by James even if it is not a mystery novel, which means that the conclusion is not necessarily true.",
