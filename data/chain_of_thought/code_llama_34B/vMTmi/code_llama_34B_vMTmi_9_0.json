The first premise establishes a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt, but the second premise only states that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. It does not provide any information about Lisa's actions or whether she bought the red shirt. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt based solely on the information provided in the argument.",
