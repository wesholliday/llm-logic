The first premise states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race. However, the second premise states that Chris might not have finished the race. This means that even if Alex did finish the race, there is no guarantee that Chris also finished the race. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alex did not finish the race based solely on these two premises.",
