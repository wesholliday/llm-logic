The first premise states that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad. However, the second premise states that Kate might not have eaten salad. This means that even if Ben did eat pasta, it is still possible that Kate did not eat salad. Therefore, the conclusion that Ben did not eat pasta cannot be logically deduced from the premises.",
