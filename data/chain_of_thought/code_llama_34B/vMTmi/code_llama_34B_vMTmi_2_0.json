The first premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was also not in the forest. There could be other factors at play that explain why the unicorn was not in the forest, such as it being sick or injured, or it having left the forest for some other reason. Therefore, the argument's conclusion does not logically follow from its premises.",
