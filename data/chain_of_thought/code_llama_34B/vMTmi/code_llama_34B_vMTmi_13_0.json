The first premise states that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the truck was not blue, then the car could not have been red. There may be other factors at play that would explain why the truck was not blue, even if the car was red. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that the car was not red based solely on the fact that the truck was not blue.",
