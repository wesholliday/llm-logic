The first premise establishes a conditional relationship between Sue's choice and Bob's choice, but the second premise only states that Bob might not have chosen pasta. It does not provide any information about what Bob actually chose, so it cannot be used to infer that Sue did not choose pizza. Therefore, the argument is invalid.",
