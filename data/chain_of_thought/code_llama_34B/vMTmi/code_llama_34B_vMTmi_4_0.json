The first premise implies that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter. However, the second premise states that the robot might not have visited Jupiter. This means that even if the alien did visit Mars, we cannot conclude with certainty that the robot also visited Jupiter. Therefore, the conclusion that the alien did not visit Mars is not supported by the available evidence.",
