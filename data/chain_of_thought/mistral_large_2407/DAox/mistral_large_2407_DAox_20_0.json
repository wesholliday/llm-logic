Modus tollens states that if the consequent (the \"then\" part) of a conditional statement is false, then the antecedent (the \"if\" part) must also be false. In this case, we have the contrapositive of the second statement: \"If the fleeg did not surn, then it was not bluttered.\" Since we know \"The fleeg was not bluttered,\" it follows that \"The fleeg did not surn.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
