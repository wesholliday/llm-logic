            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step. We are given two statements:\n\n1. \"The splat was not morphed.\"\n2. \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\"\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The splat did not quank\" from these statements.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be written in logical form as:\n\nIf P, then Q\n\nwhere P is \"the splat was morphed\" and Q is \"the splat quanked.\"\n\nAccording to the first statement, P is false (the splat was not morphed). In a conditional statement, if the condition (P) is false, the conclusion (Q) does not necessarily follow. In other words, we cannot infer anything about Q (whether the splat quanked or not) just from knowing that P is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The splat did not quank\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
