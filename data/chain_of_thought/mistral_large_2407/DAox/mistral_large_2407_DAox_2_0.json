We are also given that \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\" This is a conditional statement where the wug bimming the zoint depends on the wug being flooped.\n3. Since we know that the wug did not floop, the condition for the wug bimming the zoint is not met.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that \"The wug did not bim the zoint.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
