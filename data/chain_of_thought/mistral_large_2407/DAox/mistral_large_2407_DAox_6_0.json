We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The grommet did not sploff.\"\n2. \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\"\n\nWe are asked if we can infer \"The grommet did not plop the frink.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (\"the grommet was sploffed\") is true, then the consequence (\"the grommet plopped the frink\") is also true. However, if the condition is false (as stated in the first statement), the conditional statement doesn't tell us anything about the consequence. In other words, just because the grommet did not sploff, we cannot definitively say that the grommet did not plop the frink, as these could be independent events.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The grommet did not plop the frink\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
