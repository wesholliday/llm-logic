We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The dreb was not vroombed.\"\n2. \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\"\n\nWe are asked if we can infer \"The dreb was not spened.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (\"the dreb was vroombed\") is true, then the conclusion (\"the dreb was spened\") is also true. However, the first statement tells us that the condition is not true (\"the dreb was not vroombed\").\n\nSince the condition is not true, the conditional statement does not give us any information about whether \"the dreb was spened\" or not. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The dreb was not spened\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
