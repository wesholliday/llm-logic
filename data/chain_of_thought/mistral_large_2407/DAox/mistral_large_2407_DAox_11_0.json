            "content": "Explanation: We can use a form of argument called modus tollens to reason through this problem. The argument follows this structure:\n\n1. If P, then Q (This is given as 'If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed')\n2. Not-P (This is given as 'The flug was not blummed')\n3. Therefore, Not-Q (This is what we want to infer, 'The flug was not zimmed')\n\nIn this case, P is 'the flug was blummed' and Q is 'the flug was zimmed'. We are given that P is false (the flug was not blummed). According to modus tollens, if P is false, then Q must also be false. Therefore, we can infer that 'The flug was not zimmed'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
