Modus tollens states that if P implies Q, and not-Q is true, then not-P is also true. In this case, P is \"the shank was plooked,\" and Q is \"the shank was nugged.\" Since we know that not-P (\"The shank was not plooked\") is true, and the implication P implies Q is given, we can infer that not-Q (\"The shank was not nugged\") is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
