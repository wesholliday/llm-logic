We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The flob was not skizzled.\"\n2. \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated.\"\n\nWe are asked if we can infer \"The flob was not movated.\" To determine this, we need to look at the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the flob was skizzled\" and Q is \"the flob movated.\" According to the first statement, P is false (the flob was not skizzled).\n\nIn logic, if the condition (P) of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is false, the statement as a whole does not provide any information about Q. In other words, if P is false, Q can be either true or false; we cannot infer the truth value of Q from this information alone.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer whether \"The flob was not movated\" is true or false.\n\nAnswer: no"
