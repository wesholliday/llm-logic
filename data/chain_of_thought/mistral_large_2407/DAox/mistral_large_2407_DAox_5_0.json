We are given two statements:\n\n1. \"The zinger was not fraggled.\"\n2. \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\"\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The zinger was not smoogled\" from these statements.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement (if P, then Q), where P is \"the zinger was fraggled\" and Q is \"the zinger was smoogled.\" According to the first statement, P is false (\"the zinger was not fraggled\"). When the condition (P) of a conditional statement is false, the statement as a whole (if P, then Q) doesn't give us any information about Q. In other words, we cannot infer the truth value of Q (\"the zinger was smoogled\") from the falsehood of P.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The zinger was not smoogled\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
