We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The twonk was not plinked.\"\n2. \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (\"the twonk was plinked\") is true, then the conclusion (\"it was varnished\") is also true. However, the first statement tells us that the condition is not true (\"the twonk was not plinked\").\n\nSince the condition is not true, the conditional statement doesn't give us any information about whether the twonk was varnished or not. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The twonk was not varnished\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
