We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The whiffle was not shanked.\"\n2. \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\"\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The whiffle did not tink\" from these statements.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (\"the whiffle was shanked\") is true, then the conclusion (\"the whiffle tinked\") is also true. However, the first statement tells us that the condition is not true (\"The whiffle was not shanked\").\n\nSince the condition is not true, the conditional statement does not give us any information about whether the whiffle tinked or not. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The whiffle did not tink\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
