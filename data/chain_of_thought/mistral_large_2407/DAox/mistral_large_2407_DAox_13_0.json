We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The glip was not slogged.\"\n2. \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\"\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The glip was not tragged.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the glip was not slogged. The second statement is a conditional statement that says if the glip was slogged, then it was tragged. However, since we know from the first statement that the glip was not slogged, the condition of the second statement is not met. Therefore, we cannot use the second statement to make any inference about whether the glip was tragged or not. The information given is not sufficient to infer \"The glip was not tragged.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
