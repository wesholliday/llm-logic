We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The smonk was not vreebled.\"\n2. \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (\"the smonk was vreebled\") is true, then the conclusion (\"the smonk plagged\") is also true. However, the first statement tells us that the condition is not true (\"the smonk was not vreebled\"). Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"the smonk plagged\" because the condition for it was not met.\n\nSince the condition for plagging was not met, we cannot infer that \"the smonk was not plagged\" either. The smonk not being vreebled does not give us any information about whether the smonk was plagged or not.\n\nAnswer: no"
