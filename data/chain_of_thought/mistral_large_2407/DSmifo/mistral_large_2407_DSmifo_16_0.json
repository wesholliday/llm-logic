The first statement is \"The pen might not be on my desk.\" This implies that the pen could be anywhere else, not necessarily in the bag.\n2. The second statement is \"Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag.\" This presents two clear possibilities for the pen's location: on the desk or in the bag.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. If the pen is not on the desk (as suggested by the first statement), then according to the second statement, the only other option provided is that the pen is in the bag.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, if the pen is not on the desk, it must be in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
