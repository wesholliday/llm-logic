The first statement is \"The missing sock might not be under the bed.\" This implies that it's possible the sock is not under the bed, but it doesn't give us certainty.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the missing sock must be under the bed or it's in the laundry basket.\" This gives us two possible locations for the sock.\n\n3. If we combine these two statements, we can reason that since the sock might not be under the bed, the only other option given by the second statement is that it's in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes."
