It doesn't confirm the milk's location, just states a possibility.\n2. \"Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter\" presents two mutually exclusive possibilities: the milk is either in the fridge or on the counter.\n\nGiven that the milk might not be in the fridge, the only other option presented by the second statement is that the milk is on the counter. So, if it's not in the fridge, it must be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes"
