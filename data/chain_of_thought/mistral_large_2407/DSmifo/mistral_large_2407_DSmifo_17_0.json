The first statement is \"The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack.\" This implies that there is a possibility that the scarf is not on the coat rack, but it doesn't confirm its location.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack.\" This presents two mutually exclusive possibilities for the scarf's location.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. If the scarf is not on the coat rack (as suggested by the first statement), then according to the second statement, the only other option is that it must be stuffed in the backpack.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes"
