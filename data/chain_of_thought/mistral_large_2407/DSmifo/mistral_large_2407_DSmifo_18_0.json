The first statement is \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\" This implies that it is possible that the notebook is not on the nightstand, but it doesn't confirm its location.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer.\" This presents two possible locations for the notebook: the nightstand or the drawer.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. If the notebook is not on the nightstand (as suggested by the first statement), then according to the second statement, the only other option is that it must be in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
