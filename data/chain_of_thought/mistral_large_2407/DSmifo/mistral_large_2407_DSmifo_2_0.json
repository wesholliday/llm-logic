The first statement is \"The book might not be resting on the table.\" This implies that the book could be anywhere else, not just the shelf. It doesn't provide any certain information about the book's location.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf.\" This presents two possible locations for the book: the table or the shelf.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. If the book is not on the table (as suggested by the first statement), then according to the second statement, the only other option provided is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nHowever, the first statement uses \"might,\" which indicates uncertainty. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the book is on the shelf based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
