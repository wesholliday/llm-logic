The first statement is \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\" This implies that there is a possibility that the jacket is not in the closet.\n2. The second statement is \"Either the jacket must be hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair.\" This presents two mutually exclusive possibilities for the jacket's location.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. If the jacket might not be in the closet (as per the first statement), then according to the second statement, the only other option provided is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes"
