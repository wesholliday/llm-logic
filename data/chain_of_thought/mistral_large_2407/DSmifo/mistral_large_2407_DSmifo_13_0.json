The first statement is \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\" This means it's possible that the toy is not on the bookshelf, but it doesn't give us definitive information about where the toy is.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box.\" This gives us two possible locations for the toy: the bookshelf or the toy box.\n\n3. If we combine these two statements, we can't definitively infer the toy's location because the first statement only suggests a possibility, not a certainty. The toy could still be on the bookshelf, or it could be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: no"
