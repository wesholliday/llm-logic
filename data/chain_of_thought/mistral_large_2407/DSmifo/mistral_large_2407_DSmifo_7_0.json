The first statement is \"The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet.\" This implies that there is a possibility that the umbrella is not in the closet.\n2. The second statement is \"Either the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet or it is in the car.\" This means that if the umbrella is not in the closet, then it must be in the car.\n3. Combining these two statements, if the umbrella is not in the closet (as suggested by the first statement), then according to the second statement, it must be in the car.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes"
