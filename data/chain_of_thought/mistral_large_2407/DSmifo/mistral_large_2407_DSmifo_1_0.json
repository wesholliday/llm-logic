The first statement is \"Fido might not be in the garden.\" This means that it is possible that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not confirm that Fido is definitely not in the garden.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either Fido is in the garden, or Fido is inside.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"Fido is inside,\" we need to consider both statements together. The first statement does not rule out the possibility that Fido is in the garden, so we cannot definitively conclude that Fido is inside based on the given information. The second statement only tells us that one of the two conditions must be true, but it does not provide enough information to determine which one is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot definitively infer that \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
