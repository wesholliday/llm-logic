            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The wobble must be zooble flim and grooble plimp\" is a compound statement combining two conditions: \"zooble flim\" and \"grooble plimp.\" In logic, if a compound statement connected by \"and\" is true, then each individual part of the statement must also be true. Therefore, if \"The wobble must be zooble flim and grooble plimp\" is true, it necessarily follows that \"The wobble must be zooble flim\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
