            "content": "Explanation: The sentence \"The glorp must be on the quank and wobble a plonk snork\" is a compound predicate, where two actions are attributed to the subject \"The glorp\". The first action is \"must be on the quank\" and the second action is \"wobble a plonk snork\". When a sentence has a compound predicate, each part of the predicate can stand alone with the subject. Therefore, we can infer \"The glorp must be on the quank\" from the original sentence.\n\nAnswer: yes"
