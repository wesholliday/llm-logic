            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The snork must be froodle and glorp\" is a compound statement combining two conditions: \"The snork must be froodle\" and \"The snork must be glorp.\" In logic, if a compound statement connected by \"and\" is true, then each individual part of the statement must also be true. Therefore, if \"The snork must be froodle and glorp\" is true, it necessarily follows that \"The snork must be froodle\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
