            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The zooble must be zibber for a blimple and wump\" combines two conditions with \"and\": \"zibber for a blimple\" and \"wump\". In logic, if a statement A and B is true, then statement A must also be true on its own. Therefore, if \"The zooble must be zibber for a blimple and wump\" is true, then \"The zooble must be zibber for a blimple\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
