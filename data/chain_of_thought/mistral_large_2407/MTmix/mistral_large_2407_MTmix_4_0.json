            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step. The first statement is a conditional: \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked.\" This means that if the condition \"the fribble was snurgled\" is true, then \"the fribble must have crinked\" must also be true. The second statement is \"The fribble might not have crinked,\" which introduces a possibility that \"the fribble did not crink.\" If the fribble did not crink, according to the first statement, it cannot have been snurgled, because snurgled fribbles must have crinked. Therefore, we can infer that \"The fribble was not snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
