The first statement is a conditional: \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated.\" This means that if the flob is skizzled, it is a necessity that the flob has movated.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The flob might not have movated.\" This introduces a possibility that the flob did not movate.\n\n3. Now, let's combine these two statements. If the flob being skizzled guarantees that it has movated, but there's a chance that the flob did not movate, then it logically follows that the flob was not skizzled. Because if it were, then it would have definitely movated, which contradicts the possibility that it might not have movated.\n\nAnswer: yes."
