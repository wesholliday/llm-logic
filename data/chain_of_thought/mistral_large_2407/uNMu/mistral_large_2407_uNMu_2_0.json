            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\" means that it's not necessarily true that the griffin was in the forest. This leaves open the possibility that the griffin might not have been in the forest. The use of \"must\" in the original statement implies necessity, and negating that necessity implies possibility, not certainty. Therefore, we can indeed infer that the griffin might not have been in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes"
