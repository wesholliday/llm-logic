            "content": "Explanation: The given argument is a form of logical reasoning that can be analyzed using contraposition. The premise is \"If Ann exercised, then she did not exercise strenuously,\" which can be written as P \u2192 \u00acQ, where P is \"Ann exercised\" and Q is \"Ann exercised strenuously.\" The conclusion is \"If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise,\" which can be written as Q \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nIn logic, a statement of the form P \u2192 \u00acQ is equivalent to its contrapositive \u00ac\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, which simplifies to Q \u2192 \u00acP. This means that if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true, making the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
