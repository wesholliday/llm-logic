            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then not Q\" (where P is \"the customer was served\" and Q is \"the customer was served promptly\"). The conclusion is also a conditional statement, but it is the contrapositive of the premise, \"If Q, then not P\". In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, if the premise is true, the conclusion must be true, making the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
