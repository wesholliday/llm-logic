            "content": "Explanation: The given argument is a form of contraposition, which is a valid form of argument in logic. Contraposition involves switching and negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion. The original statement is \"If P, then not Q\" (If instructions were given, then they were not explained clearly). The contrapositive of this statement is \"If Q, then not P\" (If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given). In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning if one is true, the other must also be true. Therefore, the argument presented is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
