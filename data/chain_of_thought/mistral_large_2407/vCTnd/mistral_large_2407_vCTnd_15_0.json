The premise is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then not Q\" (where P is \"the room was tidied\" and Q is \"it was tidied thoroughly\"). The conclusion is another conditional statement of the form \"If Q, then not P.\"\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P,\" and it is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, the conclusion given is not the contrapositive of the premise; instead, it is the inverse, which is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
