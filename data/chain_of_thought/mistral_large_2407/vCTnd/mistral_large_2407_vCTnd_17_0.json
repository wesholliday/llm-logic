The given argument is of the form:\n\n1. If P, then not Q (If the customer was greeted, then they were not greeted warmly)\n2. Therefore, if Q, then not P (If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted)\n\nThis is a form of contraposition, which is a valid form of argument in logic. Contraposition states that \"If P, then Q\" is logically equivalent to \"If not Q, then not P\". In this case, the given argument is the contrapositive of the premise, which means that if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
