The contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". In this case, the premise is \"If directions were provided (P), then they were not explained clearly (not Q)\". The conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise: \"If directions were explained clearly (Q), then directions were not provided (not P)\". Since a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
