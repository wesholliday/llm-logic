The premise is \"If P, then not Q\" (where P is \"the issue was discussed\" and Q is \"the issue was discussed in depth\"). The conclusion is \"If Q, then not P\", which is the contrapositive of the premise. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
