            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the premise and the conclusion. The premise is a conditional statement: \"If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice.\" This can be symbolically represented as A \u2192 \u00acH, where A stands for \"advice was offered\" and H stands for \"it was helpful advice.\"\n\nThe conclusion is also a conditional statement: \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered.\" This can be represented as H \u2192 \u00acA.\n\nTo check for logical validity, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. In this case, the premise states that if advice is offered, it is not helpful. The conclusion, however, states that if helpful advice is offered, then advice was not offered. This is a logical contradiction because it implies that helpful advice cannot be offered at all, which is not a necessary consequence of the premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no"
