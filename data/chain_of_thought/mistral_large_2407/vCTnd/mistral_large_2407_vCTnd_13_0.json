The given argument is of the form:\n\nIf P, then not Q.\nTherefore, if Q, then not P.\n\nThis is a form of contraposition, which is a valid form of argument in logic. Contraposition states that \"If P, then Q\" is logically equivalent to \"If not Q, then not P\". In this case, the given argument is the contrapositive of the statement \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise\", which is logically equivalent to the premise \"If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much\". Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
