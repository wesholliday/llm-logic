            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument without considering the content. The given argument is of the form:\n\n1. If P, then not Q (Premise)\n2. Therefore, if Q, then not P (Conclusion)\n\nThis is a form of contraposition, which is a valid form of argument in logic. Contraposition states that \"If P, then Q\" is logically equivalent to \"If not Q, then not P\". In this case, the premise is \"If P, then not Q\", so the contrapositive would be \"If Q, then not P\", which is the conclusion given. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
