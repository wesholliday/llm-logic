            "content": "Explanation: The given argument is an example of a contrapositive in logic. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not-Q, then not-P\". In this case, the premise is \"If I went to the store (P), then I did not buy vegetables (not-Q)\", and the conclusion is its contrapositive \"If I bought vegetables (Q), then I did not go to the store (not-P)\". A statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning if one is true, the other must also be true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
