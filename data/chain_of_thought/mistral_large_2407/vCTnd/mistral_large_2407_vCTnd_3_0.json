            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the premise and the conclusion. The premise is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then not Q\" (where P is \"I ate a meal\" and Q is \"I ate a large meal\"). The conclusion is another conditional statement of the form \"If Q, then not P.\"\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P,\" and it is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, the conclusion given is not the contrapositive of the premise; instead, it is the inverse, which is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nThe inverse of a conditional statement does not necessarily follow from the original statement. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no"
