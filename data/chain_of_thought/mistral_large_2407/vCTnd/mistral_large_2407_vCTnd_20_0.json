            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the premise and the conclusion. The premise is a conditional statement: \"If P, then not Q\" (where P is \"a recommendation was made\" and Q is \"it was a strong recommendation\"). The conclusion is also a conditional statement: \"If Q, then not P\".\n\nIn logic, these two statements are contrapositives of each other. A contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then not Q\" is \"If Q, then not P\". Since the premise and the conclusion are contrapositives, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
