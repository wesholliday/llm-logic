The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not-Q, then not-P\". In this case, the premise is \"If Ben studied (P), then he did not study diligently (not-Q)\". The conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise: \"If Ben studied diligently (Q), then he did not study (not-P)\". Since the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
