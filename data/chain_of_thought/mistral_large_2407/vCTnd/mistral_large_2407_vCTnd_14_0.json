            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then not Q\" (where P is \"the meal was prepared\" and Q is \"the meal was prepared carefully\"). The conclusion is another conditional statement of the form \"If Q, then not P\".\n\nIn logic, these two statements are contrapositives of each other. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then not Q\" is \"If Q, then not P\". Since the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
