It doesn't confirm that the phone is not ringing there, but it leaves open the possibility.\n\n2. \"Either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen\" presents two possibilities: the phone is in the living room, or it is ringing in the kitchen.\n\nIf the phone is not ringing in the kitchen (which is a possibility according to the first statement), then the only remaining option from the second statement is that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes"
