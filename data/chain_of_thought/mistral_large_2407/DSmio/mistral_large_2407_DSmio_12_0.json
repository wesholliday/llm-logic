The first statement is \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\" This implies that the jacket being in the closet is uncertain, so it could be somewhere else.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet.\" This presents two possible locations for the jacket: the chair or the closet.\n\nNow, combining these two statements, if the jacket might not be in the closet (as per the first statement), then according to the second statement, the only other option provided is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes"
