The first statement is \"The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet.\" This implies that the umbrella's location is uncertain, and one possibility is that it is not in the closet.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet.\" This presents two definite possibilities for the umbrella's location: it is either in the car or in the closet.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. If the umbrella is not in the closet (as suggested by the first statement), then according to the second statement, the only remaining option is that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes"
