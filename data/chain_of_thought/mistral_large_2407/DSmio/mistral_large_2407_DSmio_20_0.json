It doesn't give us definitive information about where the sunglasses are, just that they might not be on her head.\n\n2. \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" presents two possibilities: the sunglasses are in her bag or they are on her head.\n\nGiven that the sunglasses might not be on her head, the only other option presented by the second statement is that the sunglasses are in her bag. However, the first statement doesn't confirm that the sunglasses are not on her head, it only presents it as a possibility. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: no"
