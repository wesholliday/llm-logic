It doesn't confirm Fido's location but leaves open the possibility that Fido could be somewhere else.\n\n2. \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" presents two possibilities: Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden. This statement suggests that these are the only two options for Fido's location.\n\nCombining these two statements, if Fido might not be in the garden (from the first statement), then the only other option left (from the second statement) is that Fido is inside. Therefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes"
