The first statement is \"The pen might not be on my desk.\" This implies that the pen could be anywhere else, including in the bag, but it doesn't confirm the pen's location.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk.\" This presents two possible locations for the pen: in the bag or on the desk.\n\nTo infer \"The pen is in my bag,\" we would need to confirm that the pen is not on the desk. However, the first statement does not provide a definitive claim that the pen is not on the desk; it only suggests that it might not be. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that the pen is in the bag based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
