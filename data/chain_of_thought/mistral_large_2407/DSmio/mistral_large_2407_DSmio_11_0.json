The first statement is \"The newspaper might not be sitting on the porch.\" This implies that the newspaper could be anywhere else, not necessarily on the porch.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch.\" This gives us two possible locations for the newspaper: the driveway or the porch.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. If the newspaper might not be on the porch (as per the first statement), then according to the second statement, the only other option provided is that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes"
