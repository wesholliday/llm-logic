However, it doesn't confirm their absence; they still could be there.\n2. \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" presents two possibilities: the keys are in the drawer or they are in the cabinet.\n\nTo infer \"The keys are in the drawer,\" we would need to know definitively that the keys are not in the cabinet. However, the first statement only suggests a possibility, not a certainty. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the keys are in the drawer based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
