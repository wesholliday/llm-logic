It doesn't confirm the milk's location but leaves open the possibility that it's elsewhere.\n2. \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" presents two mutually exclusive possibilities for the milk's location: it's either on the counter or in the fridge.\n\nGiven that the milk might not be in the fridge (from the first statement), the only other option presented by the second statement is that the milk is on the counter. Therefore, based on the information given, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes"
