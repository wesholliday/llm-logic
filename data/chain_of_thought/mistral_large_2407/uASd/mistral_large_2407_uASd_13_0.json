            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If I exercise, I will lose weight\" assumes that all other factors affecting weight loss, such as diet, are constant or supportive of weight loss. However, when you introduce the condition \"and eat junk food,\" this changes the scenario. Eating junk food typically means consuming high-calorie, low-nutrition food, which can counteract the weight loss effects of exercise.
