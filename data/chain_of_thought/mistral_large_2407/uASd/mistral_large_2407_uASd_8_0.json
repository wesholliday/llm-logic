However, the additional condition \"and it was misrouted\" introduces an issue that could potentially delay the package. Being misrouted typically means the package has been sent to the wrong location and will need to be rerouted, which would likely delay its arrival. Therefore, we cannot infer that the package will still arrive today if it has been misrouted.\n\nAnswer: no"
