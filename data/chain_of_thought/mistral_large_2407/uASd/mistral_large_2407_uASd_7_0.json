            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a logical implication: \"If the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm.\" This doesn't specify any conditions about the pilot light. In logic, if a statement of the form \"If P, then Q\" is true, then whenever P is true, Q must also be true, regardless of any other factors not mentioned in the original statement. Here, P is \"the oven is on\" and Q is \"the kitchen is warm.\" The additional condition \"and the pilot light is out\" is not part of the original implication, so it doesn't affect the truth of the statement \"If the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm.\" Therefore, even if the pilot light is out, the kitchen should still be warm if the oven is on, assuming the original statement is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
