It doesn't mention any other factors that might prevent me from playing games, like my computer catching on fire. The statement doesn't say that nothing else could go wrong, it just gives one requirement for playing games. So, even if something unexpected happens like my computer catching on fire, it doesn't change the fact that I've met the condition set by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
