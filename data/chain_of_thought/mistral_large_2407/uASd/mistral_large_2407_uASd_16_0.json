            "content": "Explanation: The initial statement \"If I fertilize the lawn, it will be lush and green\" assumes that other conditions necessary for grass growth, such as adequate water, are met. However, the introduction of a drought negates one of these necessary conditions. Grass needs water to absorb and process the nutrients from the fertilizer. Therefore, even if the lawn is fertilized, the lack of water during a drought would prevent it from becoming lush and green.\n\nAnswer: no"
