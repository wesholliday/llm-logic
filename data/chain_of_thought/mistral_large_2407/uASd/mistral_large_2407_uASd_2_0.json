The introduction of a bomb going off changes the conditions dramatically, introducing a significant negative event that would likely override any enjoyment from the concert. Therefore, we cannot infer that we'll still have a good time if a bomb goes off, as this event would likely cause fear, danger, and disruption, negating the premise of having a good time.\n\nAnswer: no"
