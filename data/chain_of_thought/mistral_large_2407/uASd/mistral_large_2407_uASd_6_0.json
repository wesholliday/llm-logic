However, earplugs are designed to reduce the volume of sound that reaches the ears. If you are wearing earplugs, the sound of the scream will be muffled, and it is less likely to hurt your ears. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that it will still hurt your ears if you are wearing earplugs.\n\nAnswer: no"
