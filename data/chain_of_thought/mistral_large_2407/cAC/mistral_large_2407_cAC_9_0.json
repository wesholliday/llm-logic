            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the second part (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true. However, it does not imply that the reverse is true. In other words, just because Mark bought the blue shirt, we cannot conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt, as there could be other reasons or conditions under which Mark bought the blue shirt. Therefore, the information provided is not sufficient to conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no"
