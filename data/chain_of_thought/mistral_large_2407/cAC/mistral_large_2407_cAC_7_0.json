However, it does not provide any information about what happens if Chris finished. In other words, the converse (If Chris finished, then Alex finished) is not necessarily true based on the information given. Therefore, knowing that Chris finished the race does not allow us to conclude that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: no"
