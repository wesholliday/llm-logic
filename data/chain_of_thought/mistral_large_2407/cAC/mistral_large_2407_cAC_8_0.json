            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" and \"The mummy was awake.\" This is a classic case of modus tollens in logic. If we let P be \"the vampire was awake\" and Q be \"the mummy was awake,\" then the first statement can be written as P implies Q. The second statement is Q. In logic, if P implies Q and Q is true, then P must also be true. Therefore, if the mummy was awake, and this happens only when the vampire is awake, we can conclude that the vampire was indeed awake.\n\nAnswer: yes"
