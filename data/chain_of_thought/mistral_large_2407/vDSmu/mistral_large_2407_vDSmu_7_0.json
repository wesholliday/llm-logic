P or Q (Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet)\n2. Not Q (It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet)\n3. Therefore, P (The umbrella is in the car)\n\nIn this form, if either P or Q is true, and Q is false, then P must be true. This is a logically valid form of argument because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
