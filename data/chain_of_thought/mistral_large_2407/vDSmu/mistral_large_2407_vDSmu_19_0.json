P or Q (Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist)\n2. Not Q (It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist)\n3. Therefore, P (The watch is charging on the dresser)\n\nIn this form, if either P or Q is true, and Q is not true, then P must be true. This is a logically valid form of argument because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
