Either P or Q (In this case, P is \"the scarf is stuffed in my backpack\" and Q is \"it must be draped on the coat rack\").\n2. Not Q (It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack).\n3. Therefore, P (The scarf is stuffed in my backpack).\n\nIn a disjunctive syllogism, if either P or Q is true, and Q is false, then P must be true. This form of argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
