P or Q (Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed)\n2. Not Q (It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed)\n3. Therefore, P (The missing sock is in the laundry basket)\n\nIn this form, if either P or Q is true, and Q is not true, then P must be true. This is a logically valid argument because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. The structure of the argument is such that if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
