P or Q (where P is \"the missing puzzle piece is in the box\" and Q is \"it must be blending in on the floor\")\n2. Not Q\n3. Therefore, P\n\nIn this form, if the first premise is true (either P or Q is true), and the second premise is also true (Q is false), then the conclusion must be true (P is true). This is because if Q is false, then the only way for the first premise to be true is if P is true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
