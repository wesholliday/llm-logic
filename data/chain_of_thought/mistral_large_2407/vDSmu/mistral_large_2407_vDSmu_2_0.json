Either P or Q (In this case, P is \"the book is on the shelf\" and Q is \"it must be resting on the table\")\n2. Not Q (It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table)\n3. Therefore, P (The book is on the shelf)\n\nIn a disjunctive syllogism, if either P or Q is true, and Q is false, then P must be true. This form of argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
