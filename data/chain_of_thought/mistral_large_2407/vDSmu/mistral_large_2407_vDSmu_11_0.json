P or Q (Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch)\n2. Not Q (It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch)\n3. Therefore, P (The newspaper is in the driveway)\n\nIn this form, if either P or Q is true, and Q is not true, then P must be true. This is a logically valid argument because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. The structure of the argument guarantees that if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
