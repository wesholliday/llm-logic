Either P or Q (Premise 1: 'Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch')\n2. Not Q (Premise 2: 'It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch')\n3. Therefore, P (Conclusion: 'The remote control is on the coffee table')\n\nIn this form, if either P or Q is true, and Q is not true, then P must be true. This is a logically valid argument because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
