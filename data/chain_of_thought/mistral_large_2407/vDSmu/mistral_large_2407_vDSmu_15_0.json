Either P or Q (where P is \"the shoes are in the closet\" and Q is \"they must be lined up by the door\").\n2. Not Q (it's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door).\n3. Therefore, P (the shoes are in the closet).\n\nIn a disjunctive syllogism, if either P or Q is true, and Q is false, then P must be true. This form of argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
