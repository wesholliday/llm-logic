P or Q (Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head)\n2. Not Q (It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head)\n3. Therefore, P (The sunglasses are in her bag)\n\nIn this form, if either P or Q is true, and Q is not true, then P must be true. This is a logically valid form of argument because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
