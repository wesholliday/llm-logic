            "content": "Explanation: The given argument is a form of logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\" The premise states that a well-written essay leads to an A, but it does not address the condition of the essay being turned in late. The conclusion adds an additional condition (the essay being turned in late) that is not accounted for in the premise. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise. The premise only guarantees an A for a well-written essay without considering the timeliness of the submission.\n\nAnswer: no"
