            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine whether the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. The premise states that studying hard is sufficient to pass the test. However, it does not specify that studying hard is sufficient to pass the test under all conditions, such as the test being in a different language like Chinese. Therefore, the conclusion introduces an additional condition (the test being in Chinese) that is not accounted for in the premise. This makes the argument logically invalid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no"
