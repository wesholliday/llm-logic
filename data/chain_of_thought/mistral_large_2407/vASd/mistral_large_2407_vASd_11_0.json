            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument. The premise is a conditional statement: \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"you get enough sleep\" and Q is \"you won't be tired.\" The conclusion adds an additional condition to P: \"If P and R, then Q\" where R is \"do hard labor.\"\n\nIn logical terms, the argument is of the form:\n1. P \u2192 Q\n2. Therefore, (P \u2227 R) \u2192 Q\n\nThis form of argument is not logically valid because the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. The additional condition R (doing hard labor) could potentially affect the outcome Q (being tired). In other words, even if getting enough sleep alone prevents tiredness, doing hard labor in addition to getting enough sleep might still result in tiredness.\n\nAnswer: no"
