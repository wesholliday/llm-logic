The given argument is of the form:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. P and R.\nTherefore, Q.\n\nIn this case, P is \"the car is in the garage,\" Q is \"it is safe,\" and R is \"the garage is flooding.\"\n\nThe argument takes the form of a fallacy known as affirming the consequent. The conclusion incorrectly assumes that because the car is in the garage (P) and the garage is flooding (R), the car is safe (Q). However, the original premise does not account for the additional condition (R, the garage flooding), which could affect the safety of the car. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no."
