The premise \"If the match is struck, then it will light\" assumes a standard condition where the match is dry and functional. However, the conclusion introduces an additional condition \"and it has been soaked in water,\" which significantly alters the scenario. A match that has been soaked in water will not light when struck, regardless of the initial premise. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no"
