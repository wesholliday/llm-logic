The rephrased statement \"The plonk must be on wibble or it must be on shimble\" also conveys the same meaning, that the plonk is on at least one of the two locations. The use of \"or\" in both statements indicates a logical disjunction, which does not imply exclusivity. Therefore, the two statements are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: yes"
