            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence \"The blimp must gribble a flonk or gribble a wibble snorkel\" presents two options for the blimp: either it gribbles a flonk or it gribbles a wibble snorkel. The use of \"or\" in this context implies that one or the other action is required. When we rephrase the sentence to \"The blimp must gribble a flonk or it must gribble a wibble snorkel,\" we are essentially repeating the same requirement with slightly different wording. The addition of \"it must\" before the second option does not change the logical structure or the meaning of the sentence. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
