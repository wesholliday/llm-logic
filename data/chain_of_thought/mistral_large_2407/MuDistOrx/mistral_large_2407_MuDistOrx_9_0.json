            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is \"The snorkel must be flim by quank or be flim by fribble.\" This sentence uses the verb \"be\" twice, but the meaning is essentially the same as if we used \"must\" twice. The phrase \"or be flim by fribble\" implies that if the snorkel is not flim by quank, then it must be flim by fribble. Therefore, we can rephrase the sentence to \"The snorkel must be flim by quank or it must be flim by fribble\" without changing its meaning. The use of \"it\" simply refers back to the snorkel and does not alter the logical structure of the sentence.\n\nAnswer: yes"
