            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The wumble must be on the frozz or in the shimble\" implies that the wumble has two possible locations: \"on the frozz\" or \"in the shimble.\" The rephrased statement \"The wumble must be on the frozz or it must be in the shimble\" expresses the same idea, just with slightly different wording. The use of \"it must be\" in the second clause does not change the meaning; it simply emphasizes the requirement that if the wumble is not on the frozz, then it must be in the shimble. Therefore, the two statements are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: yes"
