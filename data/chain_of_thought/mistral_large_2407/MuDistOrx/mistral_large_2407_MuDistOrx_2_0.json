            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The shimble must be in the plonk or at the zump zooble\" is a disjunction, meaning that the shimble could be in either of the two places. When we consider the phrase \"it must be,\" it emphasizes the necessity or obligation, which is already implied by the word \"must\" in the original statement. Therefore, adding \"it must be\" does not change the logical meaning of the sentence. It simply restates the original disjunction with more emphasis.\n\nAnswer: yes"
