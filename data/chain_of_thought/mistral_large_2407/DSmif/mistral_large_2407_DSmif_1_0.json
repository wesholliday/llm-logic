The statement 'Fido might not be in the garden' introduces uncertainty about Fido's location but does not confirm that Fido is not in the garden. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that 'Fido is inside' based on these statements alone, as the possibility of Fido being in the garden is not entirely ruled out.\n\nAnswer: no"
