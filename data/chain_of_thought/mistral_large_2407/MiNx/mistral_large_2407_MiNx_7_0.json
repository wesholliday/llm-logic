It does not assert with certainty that the whiffle was shanked or not. The phrase \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked\" means that it is not necessarily true that the whiffle was shanked. This aligns with the original statement because both suggest that there is uncertainty or possibility involved, rather than a definite assertion that the whiffle was shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
