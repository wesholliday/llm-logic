It does not assert with certainty that the smonk was not vreebled, but rather leaves open the possibility. On the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled\" means that it is not necessarily true that the smonk was vreebled. This statement also leaves open the possibility that the smonk might not have been vreebled. Therefore, the first statement can indeed be inferred from the second statement, as both statements are consistent with the possibility that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
