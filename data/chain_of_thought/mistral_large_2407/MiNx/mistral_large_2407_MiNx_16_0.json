It does not assert with certainty that the sneg was crampled. Therefore, it leaves room for the possibility that the sneg was not crampled. The phrase \"It's not the case that the sneg must have been crampled\" also suggests that there is no certainty that the sneg was crampled, aligning with the possibility presented in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
