In other words, it's not certain that the fleeg was bluttered. The phrase \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered\" means that it's not definite or necessary that the fleeg was bluttered, which aligns with the original statement's implication of uncertainty. Therefore, the inference can be made.\n\nAnswer: yes"
