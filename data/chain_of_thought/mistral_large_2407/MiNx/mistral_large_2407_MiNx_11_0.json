            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The flug might not have been blummed\" suggests that there is a possibility that the flug was not blummed. This implies that it is not certain or necessary that the flug was blummed. Therefore, it is logically consistent to infer that \"It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed,\" because the original statement allows for the possibility that the flug was not blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
