However, the truth of the consequence (Lucy went to the zoo) does not necessarily imply that the condition (Joe went to the park) is true. In other words, Lucy going to the zoo could be true regardless of whether Joe went to the park or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Joe went to the park based solely on the information that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: no"
