            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement that can be represented as 'Mary at wedding \u2192 Sue at wedding'. If this statement is true, it means that whenever Mary is at the wedding, Sue is also there. However, it does not imply the reverse; that is, it does not guarantee that if Sue is at the wedding, Mary must be there as well. Since we only know that 'Sue was at the wedding' is true, we cannot conclude with certainty that 'Mary was at the wedding' is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
