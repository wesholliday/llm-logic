This statement tells us that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race as well. However, it does not provide any information about whether Alex actually finished the race or not.\n\nThe second statement 'Chris finished the race' is true, but it does not give us any information about whether Alex finished the race. Since the first statement does not guarantee that Alex finished the race and the second statement only talks about Chris, we cannot conclude that 'Alex finished the race' is true based solely on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
