            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q.\" In this case, P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" We are given that Q is true (\"Mark bought the blue shirt\"). However, in a conditional statement, the truth of Q does not necessarily imply the truth of P. In other words, just because Mark bought the blue shirt, we cannot conclude with certainty that Lisa bought the red shirt. Lisa buying the red shirt is a sufficient condition for Mark buying the blue shirt, but it is not a necessary condition.\n\nAnswer: no"
