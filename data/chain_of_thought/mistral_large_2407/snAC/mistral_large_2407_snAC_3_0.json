If Q is true (\"The book is a mystery novel\"), it doesn't necessarily mean that P (\"The book was written by James\") must be true. This is because Q can be true independently of P. In other words, the book could be a mystery novel written by someone other than James. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that \"The book was written by James\" is true based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
