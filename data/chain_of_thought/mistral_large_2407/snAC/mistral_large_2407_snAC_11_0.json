However, in a logical implication, the truth of Q does not necessarily imply the truth of P. In other words, just because the muffins were blueberry, it doesn't mean that the cake was necessarily chocolate. The cake could have been any other flavor, and the muffins could still have been blueberry.\n\nAnswer: no"
