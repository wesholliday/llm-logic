However, if the consequence is true ('The pants were denim'), it does not necessarily mean that the condition ('the shirt was cotton') must be true. This is because the truth of the consequence does not imply the truth of the condition; the consequence could be true for other reasons. In other words, the pants being denim does not necessarily mean that the shirt was cotton; the pants could be denim with a shirt made of another material.\n\nAnswer: no"
