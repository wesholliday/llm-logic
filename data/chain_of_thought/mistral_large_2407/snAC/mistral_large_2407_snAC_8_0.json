If the mummy was awake, and the conditional statement is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that the vampire was awake. This is because the conditional statement only tells us that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would be awake. It doesn't give us any information about the vampire's state when the mummy is awake. The mummy could be awake due to reasons other than the vampire being awake.\n\nAnswer: no"
