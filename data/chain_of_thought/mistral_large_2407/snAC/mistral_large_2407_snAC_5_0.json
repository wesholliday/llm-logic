However, the truth of the consequence (Amy played tennis) does not necessarily imply the truth of the condition (Jeff played basketball). In other words, just because Amy played tennis, we cannot conclude that Jeff played basketball, as there could be other reasons why Amy played tennis.\n\nAnswer: no"
