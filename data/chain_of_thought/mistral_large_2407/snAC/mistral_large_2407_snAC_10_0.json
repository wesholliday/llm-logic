Just because the cat was outside (Q is true), it does not necessarily mean that the dog was inside (P is true). There could be other reasons why the cat was outside that are unrelated to the dog's location.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that the dog was inside based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no"
