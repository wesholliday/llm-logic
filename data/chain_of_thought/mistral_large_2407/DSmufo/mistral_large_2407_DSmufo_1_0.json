The first statement is \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" This can be rephrased as \"Fido does not have to be in the garden,\" which means Fido could be anywhere else, including inside.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside.\" This presents two possibilities: either Fido is required to be in the garden, or Fido is inside.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. Since the first statement tells us that Fido does not have to be in the garden, the only remaining option from the second statement is that Fido is inside. Therefore, we can indeed infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes"
