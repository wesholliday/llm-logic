The first statement is \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\" This can be rephrased as \"The notebook is not necessarily on the nightstand.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer.\" This presents two possibilities: the notebook is on the nightstand or it is in the drawer.\n\nGiven that the first statement rules out the necessity of the notebook being on the nightstand, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
