The first statement is \"It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\" This can be rephrased as \"The umbrella does not have to be in the closet.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet or it is in the car.\" This gives us two possibilities: either the umbrella is in the closet or it is in the car.\n\n3. Since the first statement negates the possibility of the umbrella having to be in the closet, we are left with the second part of the second statement: \"it is in the car.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes"
