The first statement is \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\" This can be rephrased as \"The book is not necessarily on the table.\"\n2. The second statement is \"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf.\" This presents two possibilities: the book is on the table or the book is on the shelf.\n\nGiven the first statement, we know that the book is not necessarily on the table. Therefore, according to the second statement, the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes"
