The first statement is \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\" This can be rephrased as \"The milk is not in the fridge.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter.\" This gives us two possible locations for the milk: the fridge or the counter.\n\n3. Since the first statement eliminates the possibility of the milk being in the fridge, we are left with the only other option provided in the second statement, which is that the milk is on the counter.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes"
