The first statement is \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\" This can be rephrased as \"The scarf is not draped on the coat rack.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack.\" This gives us two possibilities: either the scarf is on the coat rack or it is in the backpack.\n\n3. Since the first statement eliminates the possibility of the scarf being on the coat rack, we are left with the second possibility from the second statement: \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes"
