The first statement is \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\" This can be rephrased as \"The remote control is not under the couch.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table.\" This gives us two possible locations for the remote control: under the couch or on the coffee table.\n\nNow, if the remote control is not under the couch (as stated in the first statement), then according to the second statement, the only remaining option is that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes"
