The first statement is \"It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch.\" This can be rephrased as \"The newspaper is not on the porch.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the newspaper must be sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway.\" This gives us two possible locations for the newspaper: the porch or the driveway.\n\nNow, if the newspaper is not on the porch (from the first statement), then according to the second statement, the only remaining option is that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes"
