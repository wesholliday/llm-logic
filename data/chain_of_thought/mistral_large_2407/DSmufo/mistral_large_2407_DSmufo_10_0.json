The first statement is \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\" This can be rephrased as \"The missing sock is not necessarily under the bed,\" which means that the sock could be anywhere else, not just under the bed.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the missing sock must be under the bed or it's in the laundry basket.\" This presents two possibilities: either the sock is under the bed, or it is in the laundry basket.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. Since the first statement tells us that the sock is not necessarily under the bed, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes"
