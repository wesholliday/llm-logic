The first statement is \"It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom.\" This can be interpreted as \"The cat is not playing in the bedroom.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the cat must be playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true.\n\nGiven that the first statement rules out the possibility of the cat playing in the bedroom, the only remaining option from the second statement is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes"
