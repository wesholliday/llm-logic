The first statement is \"It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen.\" This can be interpreted as \"The phone is not ringing in the kitchen.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the phone must be ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room.\" This presents two possibilities: either the phone is ringing in the kitchen, or it is in the living room.\n\nGiven that the first statement rules out the possibility of the phone ringing in the kitchen, we are left with the second possibility from the second statement: the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes"
