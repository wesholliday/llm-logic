The first statement is \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\" This can be rephrased as \"The cookies do not have to be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar.\" This presents two possibilities: either the cookies are required to be in the pantry, or they are in the jar.\n\nGiven that the first statement negates the necessity of the cookies being in the pantry, we are left with the second part of the second statement: \"they are in the jar.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes"
