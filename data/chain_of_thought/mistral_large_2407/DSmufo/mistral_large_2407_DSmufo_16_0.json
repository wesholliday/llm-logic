The first statement is \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\" This can be rephrased as \"The pen does not have to be on my desk,\" which means that the pen could be anywhere else, not necessarily on the desk.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag.\" This presents two possibilities: the pen is either on the desk or in the bag.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. Since the first statement tells us that the pen does not have to be on the desk, the only remaining option from the second statement is that the pen is in the bag. Therefore, we can infer that the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
