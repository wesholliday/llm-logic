The first statement is \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\" This can be rephrased as \"The toy is not on the bookshelf.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box.\" This presents two possibilities: the toy is on the bookshelf or the toy is in the toy box.\n\nGiven that the first statement eliminates the possibility of the toy being on the bookshelf, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
