The first statement is \"It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\" This can be rephrased as \"The missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\" This presents two possibilities: either the piece is blending in on the floor, or it is in the box.\n\nNow, since we know from the first statement that the piece is not blending in on the floor, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the piece must be in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
