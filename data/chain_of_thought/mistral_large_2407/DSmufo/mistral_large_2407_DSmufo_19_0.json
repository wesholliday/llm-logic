The first statement is \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\" This can be rephrased as \"The watch is not on his wrist.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser.\" This gives us two possibilities: the watch is on his wrist or the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nNow, since we know from the first statement that the watch is not on his wrist, we can eliminate the first possibility given in the second statement. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes"
