The first statement is \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\" This can be rephrased as \"The jacket is not hanging in the closet.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the jacket must be hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair.\" This gives us two possibilities: the jacket is hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair.\n\nNow, since we know from the first statement that the jacket is not hanging in the closet, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that \"The jacket is draped over the chair.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
