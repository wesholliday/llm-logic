    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crastin, a nivet, and a jomial are the top bispets this breeding season. Breeders expect the crastin likely will birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, with the jomial birthing many fewer. These lead in birthing, so if the nivet doesn\u2019t birth the most offspring, then if the crastin doesn\u2019t, the jomial will. Moreover, the crastin likely will lead births and hence the nivet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the crastin doesn\u2019t lead births, the jomial will?",

            "content": "Explanation: The passage states that breeders expect the crastin to birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, with the jomial birthing many fewer. This implies that the expected order of births is crastin > nivet > jomial. The passage also states that if the nivet doesn\u2019t birth the most, then if the crastin doesn\u2019t, the jomial will. However, since it's expected that the crastin will lead and the nivet likely won't, this means that if the crastin doesn't lead, it doesn't necessarily follow that the jomial will, because the nivet is still expected to birth more than the jomial. Therefore, it's not likely that the jomial will lead if the crastin doesn't.\n\nAnswer: no"
