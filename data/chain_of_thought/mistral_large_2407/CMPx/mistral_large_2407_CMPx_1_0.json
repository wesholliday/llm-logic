The dasetil is the most likely to become the batalit, followed closely by the lentum, with the vifali trailing way behind. Since these are the only competitors, if the lentum isn\u2019t the batalit, then if the dasetil isn\u2019t the batalit, the vifali will be. Since the dasetil is ahead, the lentum most likely won\u2019t be the batalit. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the dasetil isn\u2019t the batalit, the vifali will be?",

            "content": "Explanation: The statement tells us that the dasetil is the most likely to become the batalit, followed by the lentum, with the vifali being the least likely. It also tells us that if both the dasetil and the lentum aren't the batalit, then the vifali will be. However, the statement also implies that since the dasetil is ahead, it's unlikely that the lentum will be the batalit. This means that if the dasetil isn't the batalit, it's not likely that the lentum would be either, because the lentum is closely competing with the dasetil but not ahead. Therefore, if the dasetil isn't the batalit, it's not likely that the lentum would be either, leaving the vifali as the only option left. However, the initial information tells us that the vifali is trailing way behind, so it's not likely that the vifali will be the batalit even if the dasetil isn't.\n\nAnswer: no"
