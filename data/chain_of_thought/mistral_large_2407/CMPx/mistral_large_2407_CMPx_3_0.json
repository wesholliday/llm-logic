    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a tropin, a loment, and a dralid are the top scoring vilcants this season. Experts expect the tropin likely will have the highest vilcant rate, followed by the loment, with the dralid significantly lower. These lead the vilcants, so if the loment doesn\u2019t have the top vilcant rate, then if the tropin doesn\u2019t, the dralid will. Moreover, the tropin likely will lead in vilcants and hence the loment likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the tropin doesn\u2019t lead in vilcants, the dralid will?",

The experts expect the tropin to have the highest vilcant rate, followed by the loment, with the dralid significantly lower.\n2. If the loment doesn\u2019t have the top vilcant rate, then if the tropin doesn\u2019t, the dralid will.\n3. The tropin is likely to lead in vilcants, and hence the loment likely won\u2019t.\n\nFrom point 3, we understand that the tropin is expected to lead. However, if the tropin doesn't lead, according to point 2, the dralid will only lead if the loment also doesn't lead. But since the loment is expected to have a higher rate than the dralid (from point 1), even if the tropin doesn't lead, it's more likely that the loment would lead before the dralid. Therefore, it does not follow that if the tropin doesn\u2019t lead, the dralid will.\n\nAnswer: no"
