    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fraglen, a darpil, and a votal are the top bispil teams this season. The fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by the darpil, while the votal trails far behind. These lead the league, so if the darpil doesn\u2019t have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn\u2019t, the votal will. Moreover, the fraglen likely will lead the league and hence the darpil likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fraglen doesn\u2019t lead the league, the votal will?",

            "content": "Explanation: The statement gives us a hierarchy of the teams' expected performance: fraglen, darpil, and then votal. It also tells us that if the fraglen and darpil don't have the top record, then the votal will. However, it's important to note that the statement \"the fraglen likely will lead the league and hence the darpil likely won\u2019t\" doesn't necessarily mean that the votal is likely to lead if the fraglen doesn't. This is because the darpil is still expected to perform better than the votal. So, if the fraglen doesn't lead, it's more likely that the darpil would take the top spot, not the votal.\n\nAnswer: no"
