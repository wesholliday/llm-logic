    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a garplex, a beelhet, and a peedonk are competing to be domer of the year. Experts think the garplex is most likely to win, followed closely by the beelhet, with the peedonk having a much lower chance. Since these are the only domer candidates, if the beelhet doesn\u2019t become domer, then if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will become domer. Moreover, it is likely the garplex will become domer and hence the beelhet likely won\u2019t become domer. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will?",

            "content": "Explanation: The given information states that the garplex is the most likely to win, followed by the beelhet, with the peedonk having a much lower chance. This implies that the probability of the garplex winning is high, and the probability of the peedonk winning is low. The statement also says that if both the beelhet and the garplex don't become domer, then the peedonk will. However, the likelihood of both the garplex and the beelhet not winning is low since one of them is likely to win. Therefore, the scenario where the peedonk becomes domer is unlikely because it relies on the unlikely event that both the garplex and the beelhet don't win.\n\nAnswer: no"
