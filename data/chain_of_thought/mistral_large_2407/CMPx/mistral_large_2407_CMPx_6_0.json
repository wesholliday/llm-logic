    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jentil, a lomfry, and a darsal are the leading gardam suppliers this quarter. Industry analysts expect the jentil likely will sell the most gardam, followed by the lomfry, with the darsal significantly lower. These dominate gardam sales, so if the lomfry doesn\u2019t sell the most gardam, then if the jentil doesn\u2019t, the darsal will. Moreover, the jentil likely will lead gardam sales and hence the lomfry likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the jentil doesn\u2019t lead gardam sales, the darsal will?",

If the lomfry doesn\u2019t sell the most, then if the jentil doesn\u2019t, the darsal will.\n3. The jentil is likely to lead gardam sales, and hence the lomfry likely won\u2019t.\n\nFrom point 3, we know that the jentil is likely to lead. However, we are asked to consider the scenario where the jentil doesn't lead. According to point 2, if the jentil doesn't lead and the lomfry also doesn't lead (which is likely from point 3), then the darsal will lead.\n\nSo, if the jentil doesn't lead, it is likely that the darsal will, because the lomfry is not expected to lead either.\n\nAnswer: yes."
