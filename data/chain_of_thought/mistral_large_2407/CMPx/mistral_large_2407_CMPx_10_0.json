    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantole, a dribban, and a cruggit are the most downloaded fillip apps this month. Market watchers expect the fantole likely will retain the top spot in downloads, followed by the dribban, with the cruggit download rate significantly lower. These lead the downloads, so if the dribban isn\u2019t the most downloaded, then if the fantole isn\u2019t, the cruggit will be. Moreover, the fantole likely will lead downloads and hence the dribban likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fantole isn\u2019t the most downloaded, the cruggit will be?",

            "content": "Explanation: The statement tells us that if the fantole isn't the most downloaded, then the cruggit will be, given that the dribban isn't the most downloaded. We are also told that the fantole is likely to lead downloads and the dribban likely won't. This implies that the scenario where the fantole isn't the most downloaded is less likely, but if it does happen, the cruggit would be the most downloaded because the dribban is unlikely to take the top spot. Therefore, it does follow that it's likely that if the fantole isn't the most downloaded, the cruggit will be.\n\nAnswer: yes"
