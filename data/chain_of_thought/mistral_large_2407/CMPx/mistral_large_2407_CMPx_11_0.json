    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trenist, a lanken, and a draloid are shortlisted for Drij of the Year. The trenist is considered the front runner, followed by the lanken, while the draloid is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates in contention, if the lanken doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the trenist doesn\u2019t win it, the draloid will win it. Moreover, the trenist likely will win the award and hence the lanken likely won\u2019t win it. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trenist doesn\u2019t win Drij of the Year, the draloid will?",

            "content": "Explanation: The statement tells us that the trenist is the most likely to win, followed by the lanken, and then the draloid. It also tells us that if the trenist and the lanken don't win, the draloid will. However, the likelihood of the trenist not winning is low, and if the trenist doesn't win, the lanken is more likely to win than the draloid. Therefore, the scenario where the draloid wins is the least likely. So, it does not follow that it's likely that if the trenist doesn't win, the draloid will.\n\nAnswer: no"
