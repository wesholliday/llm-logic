    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trundle, a foopet, and a crangor are likely to be the top selling whippits. The trundle will likely be #1 in sales, followed closely by the foopet, with the crangor having significantly lower expected sales. These lead whippit sales, so if the foopet isn\u2019t the top seller, then if the trundle isn\u2019t, the crangor will be. Moreover, the trundle likely will lead sales and hence the foopet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trundle isn\u2019t the top selling whippit, the crangor will be?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. The trundle is likely to be the top seller.\n2. If the trundle isn't the top seller, then the foopet is the next most likely to be the top seller.\n3. However, if the foopet isn't the top seller, then the crangor will be.\n4. It's stated that the trundle likely will lead sales, and hence the foopet likely won't.\n\nFrom point 4, we can infer that the scenario where the foopet is the top seller is unlikely. Therefore, if the trundle isn't the top seller (which is also unlikely), we're left with the crangor as the only remaining option for the top seller.\n\nSo, while it's unlikely that the trundle won't be the top seller, if it does happen, then it's likely that the crangor will be the top seller, as the foopet being the top seller is also unlikely.\n\nAnswer: yes."
