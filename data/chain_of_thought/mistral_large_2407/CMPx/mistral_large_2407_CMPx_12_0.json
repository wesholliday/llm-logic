    "user_prompt": "Suppose a stribben, a vanoon, and a jentapp are applying to rent a bondle. The owner thinks the stribben is the strongest applicant, followed by the vanoon, while the jentapp seems much less qualified to rent a bondle. Since these are the only applicants, if the vanoon isn\u2019t selected, then if the stribben isn\u2019t selected, the jentapp will be selected. Moreover, the stribben likely will be chosen and hence the vanoon likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the stribben isn\u2019t selected to rent the bondle, the jentapp will be?",

            "content": "Explanation: The statement tells us that the likelihood of the stribben being selected is high, and consequently, the likelihood of the vanoon being selected is low. If the stribben is not selected, the only remaining options are the vanoon and the jentapp. Since the vanoon is already considered less likely to be selected, the jentapp becomes the more likely choice if the stribben is not selected. Therefore, it does follow that if the stribben isn't selected, the jentapp likely will be.\n\nAnswer: yes"
