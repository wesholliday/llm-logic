    "user_prompt": "Suppose a fantole, a dribban, and a snorpul have the best odds to win this season's Rizzle Cup. Oddsmakers believe it's most probable the fantole will capture the cup, followed by the dribban, while the snorpul is a heavy longshot. Since these are the only top contenders, if the dribban doesn\u2019t win the cup, then if the fantole doesn\u2019t win, the snorpul will win. Moreover, the fantole likely will win the cup and hence the dribban likely won't win. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantole doesn't win the Rizzle Cup, the snorpul will?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

            "content": "Explanation: The given information tells us that the fantole is the most likely to win, followed by the dribban, and then the snorpul as a longshot. We are also told that if the dribban doesn't win, then if the fantole doesn't win, the snorpul will. This statement sets up a hierarchy of likelihood: if the top two contenders (fantole and dribban) don't win, then the cup falls to the third contender (snorpul). However, the likelihood of the fantole winning is high, and the likelihood of the dribban winning is lower but still higher than the snorpul. The question asks if it's likely that if the fantole doesn't win, the snorpul will. This doesn't necessarily follow from the given information because if the fantole doesn't win, the dribban still has a higher chance of winning than the snorpul. The likelihood of the snorpul winning only increases if both the fantole and the dribban don't win.\n\nAnswer: no"
