    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect are applying for one open zulision. The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

            "content": "Explanation: The statement tells us that the jantiz is the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, and then the sulect. This means that if the jantiz doesn't get the zulision, it would logically go to the next most qualified applicant, which is the cramen. However, we are also told that if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then the sulect will. Given that the jantiz is likely to get the zulision, it makes the cramen unlikely to get it. Therefore, if the jantiz doesn't get it, the likelihood falls to the next in line, which is the cramen, not directly to the sulect. The sulect would only be considered if both the jantiz and the cramen do not get the zulision. So, it does not follow that it's likely that if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will, because the cramen is still ahead of the sulect in qualifications.\n\nAnswer: no"
