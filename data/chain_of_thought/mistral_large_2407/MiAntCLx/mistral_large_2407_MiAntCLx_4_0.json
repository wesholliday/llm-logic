However, it does not provide any information about the floob being in the quibble glorp. To infer that \"The floob might be at flump blimp and in the quibble glorp,\" we would need additional information that suggests the floob could also be in the quibble glorp. Without such information, we cannot make this inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
