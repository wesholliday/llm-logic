            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The blimp might be zooble\" presents a possibility about the blimp's state. The second statement, \"The blimp might be zooble and be blurble by froodle,\" adds an additional condition to the first. Logically, if the blimp can potentially be zooble, it can also potentially be zooble and something else (in this case, blurble by froodle). The word \"might\" indicates possibility, and adding more possibilities doesn't contradict the original statement. Therefore, we can indeed infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
