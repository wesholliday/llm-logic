The first statement is a disjunction: \"Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed.\" This means that at least one of these conditions must be true: the splat is quanked or the splat is morphed.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The splat might not be quanked.\" This introduces a possibility that the splat is not quanked. However, it does not confirm that the splat is indeed not quanked; it only leaves open the possibility.\n\n3. To infer \"The splat is morphed,\" we need to determine if the splat being morphed is the only possibility left. However, since the second statement only suggests a possibility and does not confirm that the splat is not quanked, we cannot definitively conclude that the splat is morphed based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
