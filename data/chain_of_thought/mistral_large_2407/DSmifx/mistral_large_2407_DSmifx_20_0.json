The first statement is a disjunction: \"Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered.\" This means that at least one of these conditions must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The fleeg might not be surned.\" This introduces a possibility but does not confirm that the fleeg is not surned.\n\nTo infer \"The fleeg is bluttered,\" we would need to know definitively that the fleeg is not surned. However, the second statement only suggests a possibility, not a certainty. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that \"The fleeg is bluttered\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
