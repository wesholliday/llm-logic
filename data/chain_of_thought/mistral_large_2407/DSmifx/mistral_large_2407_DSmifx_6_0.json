The first statement is a disjunction: \"Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed.\" This means that at least one of these conditions must be true.\n2. The second statement is \"The grommet might not be plopped.\" This introduces a possibility that the grommet is not plopped.\n3. If the grommet might not be plopped, then for the first statement to hold true, the other condition must be true, which is \"the grommet is sploffed.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The grommet is sploffed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
