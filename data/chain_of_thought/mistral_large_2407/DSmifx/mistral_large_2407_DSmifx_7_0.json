The first statement is \"Either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked.\" This can be written in logical terms as \"T or S,\" where T represents \"the whiffle is tinked\" and S represents \"the whiffle is shanked.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"The whiffle might not be tinked.\" This can be written as \"~T,\" where \"~\" denotes negation.\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \"The whiffle is shanked\" (S) from these statements.\n\n4. If the whiffle is not tinked (~T), then according to the first statement (T or S), for the statement to be true, S must be true.\n\n5. Therefore, if the whiffle might not be tinked (~T), it implies that the whiffle is shanked (S).\n\nAnswer: yes"
