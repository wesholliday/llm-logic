We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen.\"\n2. \"Either the phone is in the living room or it is ringing in the kitchen.\"\n\nThe second statement is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true. If the phone isn't ringing in the kitchen (as stated in the first statement), then the only way the second statement can be true is if the phone is in the living room. Therefore, we can logically infer that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes"
