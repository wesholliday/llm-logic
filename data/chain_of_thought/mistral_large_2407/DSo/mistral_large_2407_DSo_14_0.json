We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The milk isn't chilling in the fridge.\"\n2. \"Either the milk is on the counter or it is chilling in the fridge.\"\n\nThe second statement presents two possibilities for the milk's location: it's either on the counter or in the fridge. However, the first statement eliminates one of these possibilities, namely that the milk is chilling in the fridge. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes"
