We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The remote control isn't hiding under the couch.\"\n2. \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch.\"\n\nThe second statement presents two possibilities for the location of the remote control. However, the first statement eliminates one of those possibilities. If the remote control isn't under the couch, then the only remaining option from the second statement is that it's on the coffee table. Therefore, based on these two statements, we can indeed infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes"
