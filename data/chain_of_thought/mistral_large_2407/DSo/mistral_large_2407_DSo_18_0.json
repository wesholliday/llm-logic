We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand.\"\n2. \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand.\"\n\nThe second statement presents two possibilities for the notebook's location: it's either in the drawer or on the nightstand. However, the first statement eliminates one of these possibilities by telling us that the notebook isn't on the nightstand. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
