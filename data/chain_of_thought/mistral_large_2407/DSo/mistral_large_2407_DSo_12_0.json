We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The jacket isn't hanging in the closet.\"\n2. \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it is hanging in the closet.\"\n\nThe second statement presents two possibilities for the jacket's location: draped over the chair or hanging in the closet. Since the first statement eliminates one of these possibilities (hanging in the closet), we are left with the only other option presented in the second statement, which is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes"
