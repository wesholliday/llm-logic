We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet.\"\n2. \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nThe second statement presents two possibilities for the location of the keys. However, the first statement eliminates one of those possibilities. If the keys aren't dangling in the cabinet, then the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the keys are in the drawer. Therefore, we can logically infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
