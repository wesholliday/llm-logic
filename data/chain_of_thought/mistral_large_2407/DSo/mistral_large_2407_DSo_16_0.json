The second statement is \"Either the pen is in my bag or it is on my desk.\" This can be written logically as \"Pen in bag OR Pen on desk.\"\n3. Since we know the pen is not on the desk, the only option left from the second statement is that the pen must be in the bag.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
