We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The newspaper isn't sitting on the porch.\"\n2. \"Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it is sitting on the porch.\"\n\nThe second statement presents two possibilities for the newspaper's location: the driveway or the porch. However, the first statement eliminates one of these possibilities\u2014the porch. Therefore, if the newspaper is not on the porch, the only remaining option from the second statement is that it must be in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes"
