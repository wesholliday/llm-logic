We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The watch isn't on his wrist.\"\n2. \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist.\"\n\nThe second statement presents two possibilities for the watch's location: charging on the dresser or on his wrist. Since the first statement eliminates the possibility of the watch being on his wrist, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes"
