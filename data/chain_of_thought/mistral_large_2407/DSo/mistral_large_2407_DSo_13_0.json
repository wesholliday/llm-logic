The second statement is \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf.\" This gives us two possible locations for the toy.\n3. Since we know from the first statement that the toy is not on the shelf, the only remaining option from the second statement is that the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nTherefore, based on these two statements, we can indeed infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
