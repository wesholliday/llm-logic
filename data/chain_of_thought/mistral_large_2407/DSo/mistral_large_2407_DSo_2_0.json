We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The book isn't resting on the table.\"\n2. \"Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table.\"\n\nThe second statement presents two possibilities for the book's location: either it's on the shelf or it's on the table. However, the first statement eliminates one of these possibilities by telling us that the book is not on the table. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes"
