We have two statements:\n\n1. \"Fido is not in the garden.\"\n2. \"Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden.\"\n\nThe second statement is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true. If \"Fido is in the garden\" were true, it would contradict the first statement. Therefore, since Fido cannot be in the garden, the only remaining option from the second statement is that \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
