We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The sunglasses aren't perched on her head.\"\n2. \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they are perched on her head.\"\n\nThe second statement presents two possibilities: the sunglasses are in her bag or they are on her head. However, the first statement eliminates the second possibility (that the sunglasses are on her head). Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes."
