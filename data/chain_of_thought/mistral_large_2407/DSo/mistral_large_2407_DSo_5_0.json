We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry.\"\n2. \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry.\"\n\nThe second statement presents two possibilities: the cookies are in the jar, or they are hidden in the pantry. Since the first statement eliminates the second possibility (the cookies aren't hidden in the pantry), we are left with the first possibility: the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes."
