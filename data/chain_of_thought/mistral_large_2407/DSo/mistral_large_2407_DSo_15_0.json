We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The shoes aren't lined up by the door.\"\n2. \"Either the shoes are in the closet or they are lined up by the door.\"\n\nThe second statement presents two possibilities for the location of the shoes. However, the first statement eliminates one of those possibilities, namely that the shoes are lined up by the door. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the shoes are in the closet. So, if the initial statements are true, we can indeed infer that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes"
