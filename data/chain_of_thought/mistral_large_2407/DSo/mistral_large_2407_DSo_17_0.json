Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it is draped on the coat rack.\n\nThe second statement presents two possibilities for the scarf's location: in the backpack or on the coat rack. Since the first statement eliminates the possibility of the scarf being on the coat rack, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack. Therefore, we can logically infer that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes"
