We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The cat isn't playing in the bedroom.\"\n2. \"Either the cat is napping on the couch or it's playing in the bedroom.\"\n\nThe second statement presents two possibilities for the cat's activity. However, the first statement eliminates one of those possibilities, namely that the cat is playing in the bedroom. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes"
