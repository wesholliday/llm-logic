The second statement introduces uncertainty about the watch being on his wrist, but it does not confirm that the watch is not on his wrist. Since the second statement does not rule out the possibility that the watch is on his wrist, we cannot definitively infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: no"
