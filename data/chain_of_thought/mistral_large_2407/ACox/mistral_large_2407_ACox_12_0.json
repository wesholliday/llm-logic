The given statements are:\n\n1. The wug was bimmed.\n2. If the wug was flooped, then the wug was bimmed.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement (if P, then Q), where P is \"the wug was flooped\" and Q is \"the wug was bimmed.\" In logic, if P implies Q and Q is true, it does not necessarily mean that P is true. This is because Q can be true independently of P. In other words, just because the wug was bimmed, it does not mean that the wug was flooped; there could be other reasons why the wug was bimmed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer \"The wug was flooped\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
