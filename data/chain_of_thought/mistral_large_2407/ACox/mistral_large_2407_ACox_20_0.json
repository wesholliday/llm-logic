The statements are:\n\n1. The wug was garpled.\n2. If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement (if P, then Q), where P is 'the wug was sproinged' and Q is 'the wug was garpled'. The first statement asserts that Q is true. However, knowing that Q is true does not necessarily mean that P is true. In other words, just because the wug was garpled, it does not mean that it was definitely sproinged. There could be other reasons why the wug was garpled. Therefore, we cannot logically infer 'The wug was sproinged' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
