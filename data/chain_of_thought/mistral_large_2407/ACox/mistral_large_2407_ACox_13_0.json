The first statement is \"The splat was quanked.\" The second statement is a conditional: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat was quanked.\" This conditional statement tells us that if the splat was morphed, it would necessarily mean that the splat was quanked. However, it does not provide any information about whether the splat was actually morphed. Just because the splat was quanked does not mean that it was morphed; there could be other reasons why the splat was quanked. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that \"The splat was morphed\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
