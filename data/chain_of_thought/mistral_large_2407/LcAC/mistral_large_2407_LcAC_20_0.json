            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\". The second statement is \"The banana was yellow\", which is Q. We are asked if we can conclude \"The apple was red\", which is P. In logic, the truth of Q does not necessarily imply the truth of P. This is because P might be a sufficient condition for Q, but it is not necessarily a necessary condition. In other words, there could be other reasons why the banana was yellow besides the apple being red. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that the apple was red based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
