The conditional statement only tells us that if P is true, then Q must be true. It does not tell us anything about the truth of P if we only know that Q is true. There could be other reasons why Q is true that are independent of P.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically conclude that \"The dog was inside.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
