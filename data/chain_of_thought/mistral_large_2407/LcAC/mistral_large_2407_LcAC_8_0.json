            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a logical implication and a fact. The first statement, \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake,\" can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the vampire was awake\" and Q is \"the mummy was awake.\" The second statement is simply Q: \"The mummy was awake.\"\n\nIn logic, if we know that P \u2192 Q is true and Q is true, we cannot automatically conclude that P is true. This is because P \u2192 Q only tells us that if P is true, then Q must be true; it doesn't say anything about what happens when Q is true. In other words, the mummy being awake doesn't necessarily mean that the vampire was awake; the mummy could have been awake for some other reason.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude \"The vampire was awake\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
