However, affirming the consequent does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is true. In other words, just because the book is a mystery novel, it does not necessarily mean that it was written by James; it could have been written by someone else. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that the book was written by James based solely on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
