            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\" We are also given that Q is true, i.e., \"Amy played tennis.\" However, in logic, the truth of the consequent (Q) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (P). In other words, just because Amy played tennis, we cannot logically conclude that Jeff played basketball. This is because the conditional statement only tells us that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis, but it does not tell us that Amy playing tennis is solely dependent on Jeff playing basketball.\n\nAnswer: no"
