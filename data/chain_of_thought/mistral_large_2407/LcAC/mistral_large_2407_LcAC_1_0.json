            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement that can be represented as 'Mary \u2192 Sue'. This means that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue also attended. However, it does not imply that Sue's presence means Mary was there. In other words, 'Sue \u2192 Mary' is not necessarily true. Therefore, knowing that Sue was at the wedding does not logically confirm that Mary was also at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no"
