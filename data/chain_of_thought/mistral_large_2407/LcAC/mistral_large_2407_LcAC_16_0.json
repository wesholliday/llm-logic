            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is a conditional statement, which can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim.\" We are also given that Q is true (\"The pants were denim\"). However, in logic, the truth of the consequent (Q) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (P). In other words, just because the pants were denim does not mean that the shirt must have been cotton; the shirt could be made of another material. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that \"The shirt was cotton\" based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
