(If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated.)\n2. Not-Q. (The flob did not movated.)\n3. Therefore, not-P. (The flob was not skizzled.)\n\nIf the flob being skizzled leads to it movating, but we know that the flob did not movate, then it logically follows that the flob was not skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes."
