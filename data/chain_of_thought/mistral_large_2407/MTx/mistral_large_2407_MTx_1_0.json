(If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.)\n2. Not-Q. (The flugel was not zargled.)\n3. Therefore, not-P. (The flugel was not blimmed.)\n\nIf the flugel had been blimmed, it would have been zargled (according to the first statement). But we know that the flugel was not zargled (from the second statement). Therefore, it must be the case that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes."
