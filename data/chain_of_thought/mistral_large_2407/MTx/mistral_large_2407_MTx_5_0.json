            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\" and \"The zinger was not smoogled.\" The first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the zinger was fraggled\" and Q is \"the zinger was smoogled.\" The second statement is the negation of Q.\n\nIn logic, if we have \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false, then we can infer that P is also false. This is known as modus tollens, a valid form of argument. Applying this to our statements, if \"the zinger was smoogled\" is false, then \"the zinger was fraggled\" must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes."
