The first statement is a conditional claim: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\" The second statement is \"The wug was not garpled.\" According to modus tollens, if the consequent (the wug being garpled) is false, then the antecedent (the wug being sproinged) must also be false. Therefore, if the wug was not garpled, we can logically infer that the wug was not sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes"
