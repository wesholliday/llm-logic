The first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the fleeg was bluttered\" and Q is \"it surned.\" The second statement is \"not Q\" (it did not surn). In logic, if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"not Q,\" then we can conclude \"not P.\" This is known as modus tollens. Therefore, if the fleeg did not surn, we can infer that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes"
