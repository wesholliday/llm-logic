            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\" and \"The sneg did not sproted the frink.\" The first statement is a conditional, meaning that if the condition (the sneg was crampled) is true, then the consequence (the sneg sproted the frink) must also be true. However, the second statement tells us that the consequence is false (the sneg did not sproted the frink). Therefore, if the consequence is false, the condition must also be false (the sneg was not crampled). This is an application of the logical principle known as modus tollens.\n\nAnswer: yes"
