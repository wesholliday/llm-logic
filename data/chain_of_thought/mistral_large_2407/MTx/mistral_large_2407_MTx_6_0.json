            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" and \"The grommet did not plop the frink.\" The first statement is a conditional, meaning that if the condition (the grommet being sploffed) is true, then the consequence (the grommet plopping the frink) must also be true. However, the second statement tells us that the consequence is false (the grommet did not plop the frink). Therefore, if the consequence is false, the condition must also be false (the grommet was not sploffed). This is an application of the logical principle known as modus tollens.\n\nAnswer: yes"
