Modus tollens states that if the consequent (the \"then\" part) of a conditional statement is false, then the antecedent (the \"if\" part) must also be false. In this case, the consequent \"the shank was nugged\" is false, so we can infer that the antecedent \"the shank was plooked\" is also false.\n\nAnswer: yes"
