(This can be written as: shanked -> tinked)\n2. The whiffle did not tink. (This can be written as: ~tinked)\n\nWe want to find out if we can infer that the whiffle was not shanked (~shanked).\n\nAccording to the first statement, if the whiffle is shanked, then it must have tinked. But according to the second statement, the whiffle did not tink. Therefore, it cannot be the case that the whiffle was shanked, because that would require it to have tinked. So, we can indeed infer that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
