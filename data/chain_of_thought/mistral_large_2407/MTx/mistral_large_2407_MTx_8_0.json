            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" and \"The sprocket was not daggled.\" The first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and Q is \"the sprocket was daggled.\" The second statement is the negation of Q, \"not Q.\" In logic, if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"not Q,\" then we can infer \"not P.\" This is known as modus tollens. Therefore, if the sprocket was not daggled, we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
