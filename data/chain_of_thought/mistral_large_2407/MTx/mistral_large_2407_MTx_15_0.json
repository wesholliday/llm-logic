            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a conditional and a negation. The first statement, \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened,\" can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and Q is \"the dreb was spened.\" The second statement is \"The dreb was not spened,\" which is \u00acQ.\n\nAccording to the logical principle of modus tollens, if P \u2192 Q is true and \u00acQ is true, then we can infer \u00acP. In other words, if the dreb being vroombed would necessarily mean it was spened, and we know it was not spened, then it logically follows that the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
