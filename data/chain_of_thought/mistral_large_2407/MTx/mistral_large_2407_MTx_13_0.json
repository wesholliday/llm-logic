            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a conditional and a negation. The first statement, \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged,\" can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the glip was slogged\" and Q is \"the glip was tragged.\" The second statement is \"The glip was not tragged,\" which is \u00acQ.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The glip was not slogged\" (\u00acP), we can use the contrapositive of the first statement. The contrapositive of P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, which is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the glip was not tragged (\u00acQ), then the glip was not slogged (\u00acP).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can validly infer that the glip was not slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes"
