(In this case, \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\")\n2. Not-Q. (\"The flug was not zimmed.\")\n3. Therefore, not-P. (\"The flug was not blummed.\")\n\nIf the flug was blummed, it would have been zimmed (according to the first statement). But we know that the flug was not zimmed (from the second statement). Therefore, it cannot be the case that the flug was blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes."
