            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument is structured as follows:\n1. If P, then Q (If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry).\n2. Not necessarily Q (The muffins might not have been blueberry).\n3. Therefore, not P (The cake was not chocolate).\n\nThis form of argument is known as Denying the Consequent, which is a valid form of argument. The structure is logically valid because if P necessarily leads to Q, and Q is not necessarily true, then P cannot be true.\n\nAnswer: yes."
