If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. (P \u2192 Q)\n2. Sue might not have been at the wedding. (\u00acQ is possible)\n3. Therefore, Mary was not at the wedding. (\u00acP)\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement. The second premise introduces doubt about the consequent of the first premise. However, the mere possibility that Sue was not at the wedding does not logically necessitate that Mary was not at the wedding. The argument is not deductively valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
