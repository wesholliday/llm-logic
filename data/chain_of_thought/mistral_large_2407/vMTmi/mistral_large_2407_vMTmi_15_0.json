If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train (P \u2192 Q).\n2. Erin might not have taken a train (~Q is possible).\n3. Therefore, Sam did not take a plane (~P).\n\nIn a logically valid argument, if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. However, in this case, the second premise introduces uncertainty (\"might not\"), which does not definitively negate the first premise. The fact that Erin might not have taken a train does not necessarily mean that Sam did not take a plane. There could be other possibilities, such as both Sam and Erin taking different modes of transportation or neither taking a plane or train.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises, making the argument logically invalid.\n\nAnswer: no"
