            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument can be rephrased as:\n1. If P (the doll was plastic), then Q (the truck must have been metal).\n2. Not Q (The truck might not have been metal).\n3. Therefore, not P (The doll was not plastic).\n\nThis argument follows the form of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens is structured as:\n- If P, then Q.\n- Not Q.\n- Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, if the truck might not have been metal (not Q), and the doll being plastic implies the truck must have been metal (P implies Q), then it logically follows that the doll was not plastic (not P).\n\nAnswer: yes."
