If P, then Q (If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake)\n2. Not necessarily Q (The mummy might not have been awake)\n3. Therefore, not P (The vampire was not awake)\n\nThis argument is an example of the fallacy known as denying the consequent. The valid form of the argument would be denying the antecedent (If P, then Q; Not P; Therefore, not Q) or affirming the consequent (If P, then Q; Q; Therefore, P). However, denying the consequent (If P, then Q; Not necessarily Q; Therefore, not P) is not a logically valid form of argument.\n\nAnswer: no"
