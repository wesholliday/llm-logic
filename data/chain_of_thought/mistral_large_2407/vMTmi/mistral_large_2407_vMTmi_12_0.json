            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument is structured as follows:\n1. If P, then Q (where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy must have gone to the zoo\").\n2. Not Q (it is possible that \"Lucy might not have gone to the zoo\").\n3. Therefore, not P (\"Joe did not go to the park\").\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus Tollens is structured as:\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, if Lucy might not have gone to the zoo (not Q), and we know that if Joe went to the park then Lucy must have gone to the zoo (if P, then Q), it logically follows that Joe did not go to the park (not P).\n\nAnswer: yes."
