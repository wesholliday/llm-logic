The first statement is a conditional: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\" This can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the dog was inside\" and Q is \"the cat must have been outside.\"\n\n2. The second statement is a negation: \"It's not the case that the cat must have been outside.\" This can be written as \u00acQ.\n\n3. We want to determine if we can infer \"The dog was not inside,\" which is \u00acP.\n\n4. According to the logical principle of modus tollens, if P \u2192 Q is true and \u00acQ is true, then \u00acP must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and modus tollens, we can indeed infer that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: yes"
