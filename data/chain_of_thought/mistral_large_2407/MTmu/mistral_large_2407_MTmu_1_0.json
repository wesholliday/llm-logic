            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" and \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\" The first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue must have been at the wedding.\" The second statement is the negation of Q.\n\nIn logic, if we have \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false, we can infer that P must also be false. This is known as modus tollens, a valid form of argument. Applying this to our statements, if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary could not have been at the wedding either, because Mary's presence would have necessitated Sue's presence according to the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes."
