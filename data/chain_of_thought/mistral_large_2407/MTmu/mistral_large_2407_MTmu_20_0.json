It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow. (\u00acQ)\n\nWe are asked if we can infer 'The apple was not red' (\u00acP).\n\nAccording to modus tollens, a valid form of argument, if the consequent (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) is also false. In other words, if the banana is not yellow (\u00acQ), then the apple cannot be red (\u00acP).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and using modus tollens, we can indeed infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes"
