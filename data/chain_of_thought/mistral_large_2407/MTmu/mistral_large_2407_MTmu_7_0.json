The first statement is a conditional: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\" This can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Alex finished the race\" and Q is \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race.\" This can be written as \u00acQ.\n\n3. We are asked if we can infer \"Alex did not finish the race,\" which can be written as \u00acP.\n\n4. According to the logical principle of modus tollens, if P \u2192 Q is true and \u00acQ is true, then \u00acP must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and modus tollens, we can indeed infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes"
