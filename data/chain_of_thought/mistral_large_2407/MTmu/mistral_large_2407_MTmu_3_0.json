            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional: \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book must be a mystery novel.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as \u00acQ, where \u00ac denotes negation.\n\n3. We are asked if we can infer \"The book was not written by James,\" which can be represented as \u00acP.\n\n4. To determine if \u00acP follows from the given statements, we can use the logical principle of modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if P \u2192 Q is true and \u00acQ is true, then \u00acP must also be true.\n\n5. Applying modus tollens to our statements, we have P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, which indeed allows us to conclude \u00acP.\n\nAnswer: yes"
