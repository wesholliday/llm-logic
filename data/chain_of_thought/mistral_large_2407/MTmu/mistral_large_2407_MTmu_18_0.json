            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\" and \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\" The first statement is a conditional, which can be written as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck must have been metal.\" The second statement is the negation of Q, \"not Q.\" In logic, if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"not Q,\" then we can infer \"not P.\" This is known as modus tollens. Therefore, if the truck was not metal, then the doll could not have been plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes"
