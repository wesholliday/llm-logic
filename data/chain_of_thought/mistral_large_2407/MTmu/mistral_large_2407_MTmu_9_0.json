            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" and \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" The first statement is a conditional, which can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" The second statement is the negation of Q, written as \u00acQ.\n\nIn logic, if we have P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then we can infer \u00acP. This is known as modus tollens. Applying this rule to the given statements, if Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes"
