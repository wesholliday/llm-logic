            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta' implies that if Sue's choice was pizza, then it is a necessity that Bob's choice was pasta. However, the second statement 'It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta' contradicts the necessity established by the first statement. This means that the condition where Sue chooses pizza cannot be true, because it would require Bob to have chosen pasta, which is not the case. Therefore, we can logically infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes"
