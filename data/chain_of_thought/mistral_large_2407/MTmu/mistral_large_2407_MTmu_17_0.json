            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten the salad\" and \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad.\" The first statement is a conditional, which can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q is \"Kate must have eaten the salad.\" The second statement is the negation of Q, which can be written as \u00acQ.\n\nIn logic, if we have P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then we can infer \u00acP. This is known as modus tollens. In this case, \u00acP would be \"Ben did not eat pasta.\" So, if Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben could not have eaten the pasta, because if he did, it would mean Kate must have eaten the salad, which contradicts the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
