The first statement is a conditional: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\" The second statement denies the consequent of the conditional: \"It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter.\" According to modus tollens, if the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false. Therefore, if the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes"
