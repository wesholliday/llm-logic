(In this case, \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\")\n2. Not-Q. (\"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\")\n3. Therefore, not-P. (\"The griffin was not in the forest.\")\n\nIf the second premise (not-Q) is true, then the first premise (If P, then Q) implies that P cannot be true. Therefore, we can indeed infer \"The griffin was not in the forest\".\n\nAnswer: yes."
