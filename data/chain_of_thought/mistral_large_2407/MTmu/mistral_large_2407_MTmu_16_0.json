The first statement is a conditional: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\" This can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants must have been denim.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\" This can be written as \u00acQ.\n\n3. We want to determine if we can infer \"The shirt was not cotton\" (\u00acP).\n\n4. According to the logical principle of modus tollens, if P \u2192 Q is true and \u00acQ is true, then \u00acP must be true.\n\n5. Applying modus tollens to our statements, we can infer that since the pants were not denim (\u00acQ), the shirt was not cotton (\u00acP).\n\nAnswer: yes"
