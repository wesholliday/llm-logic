            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis\" and \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\" The first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy must have played tennis.\" The second statement is the negation of Q, i.e., \"not Q.\" In logic, if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"not Q,\" then we can infer \"not P.\" This is known as modus tollens. Applying this rule to the given statements, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes"
