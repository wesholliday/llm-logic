We are given the statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\" This can be written in logical terms as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the vampire was awake\" and Q is \"the mummy must have been awake.\"\n\n2. We are also given the statement \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\" This can be written as \u00acQ.\n\n3. We want to determine if we can infer \"The vampire was not awake,\" which is \u00acP.\n\n4. According to the logical principle of modus tollens, if P \u2192 Q is true and \u00acQ is true, then \u00acP must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and modus tollens, we can indeed infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes"
