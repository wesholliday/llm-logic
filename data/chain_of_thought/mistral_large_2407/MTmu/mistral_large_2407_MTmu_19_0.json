            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\" and \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\" The first statement is a conditional, which can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen must have watched basketball.\" The second statement is the negation of Q, which can be written as \u00acQ.\n\nIn logic, if we have P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then we can infer \u00acP. This is known as modus tollens. Applying this rule to the given statements, if Jen did not watch basketball (\u00acQ), then Tom did not watch football (\u00acP).\n\nAnswer: yes"
