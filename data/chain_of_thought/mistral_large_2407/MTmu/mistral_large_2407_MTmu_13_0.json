            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\" and \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\" The first statement is a conditional, which can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck must have been blue.\" The second statement is the negation of Q, which can be written as \u00acQ.\n\nIn logic, if we have P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then we can infer \u00acP. This is known as modus tollens, a valid form of argument. Applying this to our statements, if the truck was not necessarily blue (\u00acQ), then we can infer that the car was not red (\u00acP).\n\nAnswer: yes"
