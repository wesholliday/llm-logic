            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement that can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" We are also given that Q is true (\"Mark bought the blue shirt\"). However, in logic, the truth of the consequent (Q) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (P). In other words, just because Mark bought the blue shirt, we cannot deduce with certainty that Lisa bought the red shirt. This is because there could be other reasons or conditions under which Mark bought the blue shirt that are not dependent on Lisa buying the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no"
