            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement that can be represented as \"Mary at wedding \u2192 Sue at wedding.\" This means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there as well. However, the reverse is not necessarily true. Just because Sue was at the wedding, it does not imply that Mary was there. The second statement \"Sue was at the wedding\" does not provide any information about Mary's presence. Therefore, we cannot deduce that Mary was at the wedding based solely on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
