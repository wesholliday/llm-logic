            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" is a conditional statement that can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q is \"Kate ate salad\". We are also given that Q is true (\"Kate ate salad\"). However, in a conditional statement P \u2192 Q, knowing that Q is true does not necessarily mean that P is true. This is because P \u2192 Q is also true when P is false and Q is true. Therefore, we cannot deduce that \"Ben ate pasta\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
