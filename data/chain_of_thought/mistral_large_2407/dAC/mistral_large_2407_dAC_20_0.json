            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q.\" We are also given that \"The banana was yellow,\" which is Q. However, knowing that Q is true does not necessarily mean that P is true. In logic, this is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. Just because the banana was yellow does not mean that the apple was definitely red; the banana could be yellow for other reasons. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce that the apple was red based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
