            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim' is a conditional statement that can be written as 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the shirt was cotton' and Q is 'the pants were denim'. We are also given that Q is true ('The pants were denim'). However, in a conditional statement, the truth of Q does not necessarily imply the truth of P. In other words, just because the pants were denim, it doesn't mean that the shirt was definitely cotton; the shirt could be made of other materials. Therefore, we cannot deduce 'The shirt was cotton' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
