            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is a conditional statement, which does not imply that the inverse (\"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic\") is true. In logic, if a statement is of the form \"If P, then Q\", knowing that Q is true does not necessarily mean that P is true. There could be other reasons why the truck was metal, not exclusively dependent on the doll being plastic. Therefore, we cannot deduce \"The doll was plastic\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
