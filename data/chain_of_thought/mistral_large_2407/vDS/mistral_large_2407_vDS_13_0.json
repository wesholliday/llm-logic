Either P or Q (In this case, P is \"the toy is in the toy box\" and Q is \"it is sitting on the shelf\").\n2. Not Q (The toy isn't sitting on the shelf).\n3. Therefore, P (The toy is in the toy box).\n\nIn a disjunctive syllogism, if either P or Q is true, and Q is false, then P must be true. This form of argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
