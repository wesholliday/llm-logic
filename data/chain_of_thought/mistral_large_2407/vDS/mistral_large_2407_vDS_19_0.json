Either P or Q (P: The watch is charging on the dresser, Q: It is on his wrist)\n2. Not Q (The watch isn't on his wrist)\n3. Therefore, P (The watch is charging on the dresser)\n\nIn this form, if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. The first premise presents two possibilities, and the second premise eliminates one of those possibilities. Therefore, the remaining possibility must be the case.\n\nAnswer: yes"
