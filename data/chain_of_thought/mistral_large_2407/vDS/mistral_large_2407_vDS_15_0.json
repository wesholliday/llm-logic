Therefore, P.\n\nIn this case, P is \"the shoes are in the closet\" and Q is \"they are lined up by the door\". The second premise, \"The shoes aren't lined up by the door\", negates Q. Therefore, according to the structure of the disjunctive syllogism, we can logically conclude that P is true, i.e., \"The shoes are in the closet\".\n\nAnswer: yes."
