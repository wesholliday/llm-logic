P or Q (Either the milk is on the counter or it is chilling in the fridge)\n2. Not Q (The milk isn't chilling in the fridge)\n3. Therefore, P (The milk is on the counter)\n\nIn this case, if the milk is not chilling in the fridge, then the only other option given by the first premise is that the milk is on the counter. This form of argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
