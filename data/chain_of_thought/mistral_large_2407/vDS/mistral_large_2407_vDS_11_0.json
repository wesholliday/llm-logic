Either P or Q (In this case, P is \"the newspaper is in the driveway\" and Q is \"it is sitting on the porch\").\n2. Not Q (The newspaper isn't sitting on the porch).\n3. Therefore, P (The newspaper is in the driveway).\n\nIn a disjunctive syllogism, if either P or Q is true, and Q is false, then P must be true. This form of argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
