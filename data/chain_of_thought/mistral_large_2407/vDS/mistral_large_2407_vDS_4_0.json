Either P or Q (where P is \"the cat is napping on the couch\" and Q is \"it's playing in the bedroom\").\n2. Not Q (the cat isn't playing in the bedroom).\n3. Therefore, P (the cat is napping on the couch).\n\nIn this form, if the first premise is true (either P or Q), and the second premise is also true (not Q), then the conclusion must be true (P). This is because if Q is false, then the only remaining option from the first premise is P.\n\nAnswer: yes."
