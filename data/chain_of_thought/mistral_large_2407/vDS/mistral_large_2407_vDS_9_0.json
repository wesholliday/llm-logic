Either P or Q (where P is \"the missing puzzle piece is in the box\" and Q is \"it is blending in on the floor\").\n2. Not Q (the missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor).\n3. Therefore, P (the missing puzzle piece is in the box).\n\nIn this form, if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. The first premise presents two possibilities, and the second premise eliminates one of them, leaving the conclusion as the only remaining possibility. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
