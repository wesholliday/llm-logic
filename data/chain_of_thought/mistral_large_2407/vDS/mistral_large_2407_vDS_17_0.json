Either P or Q (In this case, P is \"the scarf is stuffed in my backpack\" and Q is \"it is draped on the coat rack\")\n2. Not Q (The scarf isn't draped on the coat rack)\n3. Therefore, P (The scarf is stuffed in my backpack)\n\nIn this form of argument, if the first premise is true (either P or Q), and the second premise is also true (not Q), then the conclusion must be true (P). This is because if Q is false, then the only remaining option from the first premise is P.\n\nAnswer: yes"
