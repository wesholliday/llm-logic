            "content": "Explanation: The given argument is a form of disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid form of argument. The structure of the argument is as follows:\n\n1. Either P or Q (In this case, 'Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden')\n2. Not Q (In this case, 'Fido is not in the garden')\n3. Therefore, P (In this case, 'Fido is inside')\n\nIn this form of argument, if the first premise (P or Q) is true, and the second premise (Not Q) is true, then the conclusion (P) must be true. This is because if Q is false, then the only way for the first premise to be true is if P is true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
