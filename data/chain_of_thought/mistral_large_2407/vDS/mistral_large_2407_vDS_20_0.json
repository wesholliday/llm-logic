P or Q (Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they are perched on her head)\n2. Not Q (The sunglasses aren't perched on her head)\n3. Therefore, P (The sunglasses are in her bag)\n\nIn this form, if the first premise (P or Q) is true and the second premise (Not Q) is also true, then the conclusion (P) must be true. This is because if Q is false, then P must be true for the first premise (P or Q) to be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
