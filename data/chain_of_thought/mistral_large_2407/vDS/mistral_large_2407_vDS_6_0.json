Either P or Q (In this case, P is \"the phone is in the living room\" and Q is \"it is ringing in the kitchen\").\n2. Not Q (The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen).\n3. Therefore, P (The phone is in the living room).\n\nIn a disjunctive syllogism, if either P or Q is true, and Q is false, then P must be true. This form of argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
