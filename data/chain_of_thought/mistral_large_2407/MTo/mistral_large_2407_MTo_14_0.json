We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The wolf was not in the den.\"\n2. \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q.\" In logic, if \"If P, then Q\" is true and Q is false, then P must also be false. This is known as modus tollens.\n\nIn this case, Q is \"the wolf was in the den,\" which we know is false from the first statement. Therefore, P, which is \"the bear was in the cave,\" must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes"
