We are given two statements:\n\n1. \"The cat was not outside.\"\n2. \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\"\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The dog was inside\" from these statements.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, often written in logical form as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the dog was inside\" and Q is \"the cat was outside.\"\n\nAccording to the first statement, we know that Q (\"the cat was outside\") is false.\n\nIn a conditional statement P \u2192 Q, if Q is false, it does not necessarily mean that P is false. The statement P \u2192 Q only tells us that if P is true, then Q must be true. It does not tell us anything about the truth value of P when Q is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the truth value of P (\"the dog was inside\") from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
