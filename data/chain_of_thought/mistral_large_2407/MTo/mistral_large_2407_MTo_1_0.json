We have two statements:\n\n1. \"Sue was not at the wedding.\"\n2. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be written as \"Mary at wedding \u2192 Sue at wedding.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"Sue not at wedding \u2192 Mary not at wedding.\" Since the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can use it in our reasoning.\n\nGiven that \"Sue was not at the wedding,\" we can apply the contrapositive and infer that \"Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
