We have two statements:\n\n1. \"Chris did not finish the race.\"\n2. \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be written as \"Alex finished the race \u2192 Chris finished the race.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"Chris did not finish the race \u2192 Alex did not finish the race,\" which is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement.\n\nSince we know that \"Chris did not finish the race\" is true, according to the contrapositive, we can indeed infer that \"Alex did not finish the race.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
