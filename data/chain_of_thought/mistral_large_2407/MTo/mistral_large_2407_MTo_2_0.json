            "content": "Explanation: We can use modus tollens to reason through this problem. Modus tollens is a form of argument that goes as follows: if P, then Q; not-Q; therefore, not-P. In this case, let's replace P with \"the griffin was in the forest\" and Q with \"the unicorn was in the forest\". We are given \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" (if P, then Q) and \"The unicorn was not in the forest\" (not-Q). Therefore, we can infer \"The griffin was not in the forest\" (not-P).\n\nAnswer: yes"
