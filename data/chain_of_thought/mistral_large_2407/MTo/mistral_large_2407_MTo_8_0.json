We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The mummy was not awake.\"\n2. \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be written as \"Vampire awake \u2192 Mummy awake.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"Mummy not awake \u2192 Vampire not awake.\" Since we know from the first statement that the mummy was not awake, applying the contrapositive allows us to infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes"
