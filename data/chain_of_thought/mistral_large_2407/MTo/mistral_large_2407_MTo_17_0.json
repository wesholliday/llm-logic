We have two statements:\n\n1. \"Kate did not eat the salad.\"\n2. \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be written as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q is \"Kate ate the salad.\"\n\nIf we know that Q is false (Kate did not eat the salad), then P must also be false (Ben did not eat pasta), because if P were true (Ben ate pasta), then Q would have to be true (Kate ate the salad), which contradicts the first statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes"
