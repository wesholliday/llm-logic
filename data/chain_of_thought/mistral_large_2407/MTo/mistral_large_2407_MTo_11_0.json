We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The muffins were not blueberry.\"\n2. \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be written as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nIf P were true (the cake was chocolate), then Q would have to be true (the muffins were blueberry). But we know from the first statement that Q is false (the muffins were not blueberry). Therefore, P must also be false (the cake was not chocolate), because if P were true, it would make Q true, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes."
