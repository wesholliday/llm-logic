If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that \"The shirt was not cotton\" from these statements.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be written as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim.\"\n\nAccording to the first statement, Q is false (the pants were not denim). In a conditional statement \"If P, then Q,\" if Q is false, then P must also be false for the statement to be true.\n\nTherefore, if \"the pants were not denim\" is true, then \"the shirt was cotton\" must be false, leading us to infer that \"The shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
