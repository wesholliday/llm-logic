            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step. We have two statements:\n\n1. Amy did not play tennis.\n2. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be written as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis\".\n\nIf P were true (Jeff played basketball), then according to the conditional statement, Q would also have to be true (Amy played tennis). However, we know from the first statement that Q is false (Amy did not play tennis).\n\nTherefore, since Q is false, P must also be false (Jeff did not play basketball). This is an application of the logical principle known as modus tollens.\n\nAnswer: yes"
