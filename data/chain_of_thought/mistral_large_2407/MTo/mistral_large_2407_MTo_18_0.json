If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that \"The doll was not plastic\" from these statements.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, often referred to as an \"if-then\" statement. If the condition (\"the doll was plastic\") were true, then the result (\"the truck was metal\") would also have to be true. However, we know from the first statement that the truck was not metal. This means the result of the conditional statement is false.\n\nIn logic, if the result of a conditional statement is false, then the condition must also be false. Therefore, since the truck was not metal, the doll could not have been plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes."
