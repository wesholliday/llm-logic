If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that \"Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n\nTo do this, let's consider the second statement as a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q is \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\nAccording to the first statement, we know that Q (\"Bob chose pasta\") is false.\n\nIn a conditional statement \"If P, then Q,\" if Q is false, then P must also be false (this is known as the contrapositive of the statement).\n\nTherefore, if \"Bob chose pasta\" is false, then \"Sue chose pizza\" must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes."
