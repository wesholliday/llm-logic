            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step. We have two statements:\n\n1. Jen did not watch basketball.\n2. If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be written in the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball\".\n\nIf we assume Tom watched football (P is true), then according to the second statement, Jen must have watched basketball (Q is true). But we know from the first statement that Jen did not watch basketball (Q is false).\n\nThis creates a contradiction. Therefore, our assumption that Tom watched football must be false. Hence, Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes."
