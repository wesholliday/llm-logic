We are given two statements:\n\n1. \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\"\n2. \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be written as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nIf we assume that Joe did go to the park (P is true), then according to the conditional statement, Lucy must have gone to the zoo (Q is true). However, we know from the first statement that Lucy did not go to the zoo (Q is false). This creates a contradiction.\n\nTo avoid this contradiction, we must conclude that our assumption is wrong. Therefore, Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes"
