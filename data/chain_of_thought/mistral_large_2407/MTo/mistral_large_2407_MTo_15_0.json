We have two statements:\n\n1. \"Erin did not take a train.\"\n2. \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be rephrased as \"Sam took a plane \u2192 Erin took a train.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"Erin did not take a train \u2192 Sam did not take a plane,\" which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nGiven that the first statement asserts \"Erin did not take a train,\" we can apply this to the contrapositive to infer that \"Sam did not take a plane.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
