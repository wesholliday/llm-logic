If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the apple was red) is true, then the consequence (the banana was yellow) must also be true. However, we know from the first statement that the banana was not yellow. This means that the consequence is false. If the consequence is false, then the condition must also be false (because if the condition were true, the consequence would have to be true as well). Therefore, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes"
