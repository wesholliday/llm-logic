If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q.\" In this case, P is \"the book was written by James,\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nIf P were true, then Q would also have to be true. But we know from the first statement that Q is false (the book is not a mystery novel). Therefore, P must also be false (the book was not written by James). This is an application of the logical principle known as modus tollens.\n\nAnswer: yes."
