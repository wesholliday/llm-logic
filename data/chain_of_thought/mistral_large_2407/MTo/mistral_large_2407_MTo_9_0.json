We are also given that \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nTo analyze this, let's consider the contrapositive of the second statement. The contrapositive of \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\nSince we know from the first statement that \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt,\" applying the contrapositive, we can conclude that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
