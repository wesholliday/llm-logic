We are also given that if the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n3. Since we know the truck was not blue, the condition \"if the car was red\" cannot be true, because it would imply that the truck was blue.\n4. Therefore, the car could not have been red, because that would contradict the fact that the truck was not blue.\n\nAnswer: yes"
