If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the alien visited Mars) is true, then the consequence (the robot visited Jupiter) must also be true.\n\nHowever, we know from the first statement that the robot did not visit Jupiter. This means that the consequence of the conditional statement is false. For the conditional statement to be true, if the consequence is false, then the condition must also be false.\n\nTherefore, if the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes."
