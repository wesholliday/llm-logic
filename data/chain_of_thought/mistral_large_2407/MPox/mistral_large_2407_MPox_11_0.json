The conditional statement is \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\" The fact given is \"The flug was blummed.\" According to the rules of logical inference, specifically modus ponens, if the condition (\"the flug was blummed\") is true, then the consequence (\"the flug was zimmed\") must also be true. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can indeed infer that \"The flug was zimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
