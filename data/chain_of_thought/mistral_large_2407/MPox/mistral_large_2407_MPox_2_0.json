If P, then Q (Here, P is \"the wug was flooped\" and Q is \"the wug bimmed the zoint\")\n2. P is true (\"the wug was flooped\")\n3. Therefore, Q is true (\"the wug bimmed the zoint\")\n\nGiven that \"the wug was flooped\" and \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint\", we can logically conclude that \"the wug bimmed the zoint\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
