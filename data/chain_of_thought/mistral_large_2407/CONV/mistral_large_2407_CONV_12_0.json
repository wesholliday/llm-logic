            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is a conditional statement that can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" The inverse of this statement is \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park,\" which can be represented as Q \u2192 P. In logic, the truth of the original statement does not guarantee the truth of its inverse. For example, it's possible that Lucy went to the zoo for other reasons, not necessarily because Joe went to the park. Therefore, we cannot logically infer Q \u2192 P from P \u2192 Q.\n\nAnswer: no"
