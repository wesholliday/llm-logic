            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" The inference in question is the converse of the given statement, which is \"If Q, then P.\" In logic, the converse of a statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true. The truth of the converse depends on the specific context or additional information not provided in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot logically infer \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt\" from the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
