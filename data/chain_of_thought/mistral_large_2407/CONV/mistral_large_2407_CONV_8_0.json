            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the vampire was awake\" and Q is \"the mummy was awake\". To infer \"If Q, then P\", we would need the original statement to be a biconditional (i.e., \"If and only if P, then Q\"), or we would need additional information that establishes the reverse implication. However, the original statement only provides one-way information. Therefore, we cannot logically infer \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake\" from the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
