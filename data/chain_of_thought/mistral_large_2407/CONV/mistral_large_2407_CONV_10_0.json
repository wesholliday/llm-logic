The question asks if we can infer the converse, \"If Q, then P\". In logic, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. Just because P implies Q, it does not mean that Q implies P. Additional information would be needed to establish the truth of the converse. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside\" from the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
