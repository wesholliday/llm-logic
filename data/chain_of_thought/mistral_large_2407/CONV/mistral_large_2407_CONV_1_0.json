            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement that can be represented as \"Mary \u2192 Sue\". This does not necessarily mean that Sue's presence implies Mary's presence. In other words, \"Sue \u2192 Mary\" is not necessarily true. For example, it could be the case that Sue was at the wedding regardless of whether Mary was there or not. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
