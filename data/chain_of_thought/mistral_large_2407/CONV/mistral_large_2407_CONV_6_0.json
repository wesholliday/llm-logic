The question asks if we can infer the converse, \"If Q, then P\". In logic, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true. The original statement only tells us what happens if Sue chose pizza; it does not tell us what happens if Bob chose pasta. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza\" based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
