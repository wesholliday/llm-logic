            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" and \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" The first statement is a conditional statement (if P, then Q), where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" The second statement tells us that P is false. In a conditional statement, if the condition (P) is false, we cannot infer anything about Q; it could be either true or false. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
