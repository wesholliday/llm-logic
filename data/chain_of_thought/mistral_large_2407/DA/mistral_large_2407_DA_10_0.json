The first statement is a conditional: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This means that if the dog is inside, the cat must be outside. However, it doesn't tell us anything about where the cat is if the dog is not inside. The second statement is \"The dog was not inside.\" Since the first statement doesn't provide any information about the cat's location when the dog is not inside, we cannot infer anything about the cat's location from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
