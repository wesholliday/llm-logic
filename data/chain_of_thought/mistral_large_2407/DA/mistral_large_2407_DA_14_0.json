            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" and \"The bear was not in the cave.\" The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that the wolf being in the den is dependent on the bear being in the cave. However, the second statement tells us that the bear was not in the cave. Since the condition for the wolf being in the den is not met (because the bear was not in the cave), we cannot conclude that the wolf was in the den. However, we also cannot directly conclude that the wolf was not in the den, because the statements do not provide information about the wolf's location when the bear is not in the cave. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The wolf was not in the den\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
