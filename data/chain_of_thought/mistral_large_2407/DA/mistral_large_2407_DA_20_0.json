            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are an example of a conditional statement and its negation. The first statement is a conditional: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow,\" which can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow.\" The second statement is the negation of the antecedent (P): \"The apple was not red,\" which can be written as \u00acP.\n\nIn logic, the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP) does not necessarily imply the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ). In other words, just because the apple was not red, it does not mean that the banana was not yellow. The banana could still be yellow for other reasons not mentioned in the given statements. Therefore, we cannot logically infer \"The banana was not yellow\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
