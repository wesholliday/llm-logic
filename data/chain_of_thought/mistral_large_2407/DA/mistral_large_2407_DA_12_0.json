If Joe did not go to the park, then the condition for Lucy going to the zoo is not met. Therefore, we cannot infer that Lucy went to the zoo, but we also cannot definitively infer that she did not go to the zoo, as the statements do not provide information about Lucy's actions independent of Joe's.\n\nAnswer: no"
