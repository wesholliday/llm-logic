The structure of the argument is as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q (If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest)\n2. Not-P (The griffin was not in the forest)\n\nFrom these two statements, modus tollens allows us to infer:\n\n3. Not-Q (The unicorn was not in the forest)\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can validly conclude that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes"
