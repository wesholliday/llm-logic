            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" and \"The vampire was not awake.\" The first statement is a conditional, meaning that the mummy being awake depends on the vampire being awake. However, the second statement tells us that the vampire was not awake. Therefore, the condition for the mummy being awake is not met. In logical terms, if P implies Q and P is false, then Q can be false, but it doesn't necessarily have to be. The mummy could still be awake due to other reasons not mentioned here. So, we cannot definitively infer that the mummy was not awake based solely on these statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
