            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are an example of a logical implication and its negation. The first statement is \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel,\" which can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel.\" The second statement is \"The book was not written by James,\" which is the negation of P (~P).\n\nIn logic, if we have P \u2192 Q and we know ~P, it doesn't necessarily mean we can infer ~Q. This is because the truth of Q doesn't depend on the truth of P alone; Q could still be true even if P is false. In other words, just because the book wasn't written by James doesn't mean it's not a mystery novel; someone else could have written a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The book is not a mystery novel\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
