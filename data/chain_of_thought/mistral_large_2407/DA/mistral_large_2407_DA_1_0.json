            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and \"Mary was not at the wedding.\" The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that Sue's presence is dependent on Mary's presence. However, the second statement tells us that Mary was not at the wedding. Since Mary's presence is a condition for Sue's presence, and Mary was not there, we cannot definitively conclude that Sue was not at the wedding; we only know that the condition for her presence was not met. Sue might or might not have been at the wedding based on other factors not mentioned in the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
