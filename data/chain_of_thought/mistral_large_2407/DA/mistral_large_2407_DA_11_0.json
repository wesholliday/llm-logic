            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are an example of a conditional statement and its negation. The first statement is \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry,\" which can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins were blueberry.\" The second statement is \"The cake was not chocolate,\" which is the negation of P (~P).\n\nIn logic, if the condition (P) is false, it does not necessarily mean that the result (Q) is false. The statement P \u2192 Q only tells us what happens when P is true, not when P is false. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The muffins were not blueberry\" (~Q) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
