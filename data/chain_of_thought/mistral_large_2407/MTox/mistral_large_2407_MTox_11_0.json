We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The flug was not zimmed.\"\n2. \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\"\n\nFrom the second statement, we can understand that being \"blummed\" is a sufficient condition for being \"zimmed.\" In other words, if the flug was blummed, it necessarily follows that it was zimmed.\n\nHowever, since we know from the first statement that the flug was not zimmed, it logically follows that the flug could not have been blummed. If it were blummed, it would have been zimmed, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flug was not blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
