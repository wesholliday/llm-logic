We are also given that \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\" This can be written in logical form as \"sproinged \u2192 garpled.\"\n3. If the wug was sproinged, then according to the second statement, it must have been garpled. But we know from the first statement that the wug was not garpled.\n4. Therefore, since being sproinged would lead to being garpled (which it isn't), the wug cannot have been sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes"
