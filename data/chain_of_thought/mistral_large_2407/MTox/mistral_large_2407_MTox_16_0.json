We are also given that \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the sneg was crampled\" and Q is \"the sneg sproted the frink.\"\n3. From the first statement, we know that Q is false (the sneg did not sproted the frink).\n4. In a conditional statement \"If P, then Q,\" if Q is false, then P must also be false. This is known as the contrapositive of the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, if \"the sneg sproted the frink\" is false, then \"the sneg was crampled\" must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes"
