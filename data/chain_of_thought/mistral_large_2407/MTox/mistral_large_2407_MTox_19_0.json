We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The smonk did not plagged\"\n2. \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional, meaning that if the smonk was vreebled, then it must have plagged. However, from the first statement, we know that the smonk did not plagged. Therefore, the condition of the smonk being vreebled cannot be true, because it would necessitate that the smonk plagged, which contradicts the first statement. So, we can infer that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
