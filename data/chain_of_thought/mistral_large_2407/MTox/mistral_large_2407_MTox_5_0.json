If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that \"The zinger was not fraggled.\"\n\nFrom the second statement, we can understand that if the zinger was fraggled, it would have been smoogled. However, from the first statement, we know that the zinger was not smoogled. Therefore, it cannot be the case that the zinger was fraggled, because that would imply it was smoogled, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nSo, logically, if the zinger being fraggled leads to a contradiction (that it was smoogled), then it must be the case that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
