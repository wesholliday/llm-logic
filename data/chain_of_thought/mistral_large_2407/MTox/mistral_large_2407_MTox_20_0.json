We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The fleeg did not surn.\"\n2. \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\"\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The fleeg was not bluttered.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional, meaning that if the condition (\"the fleeg was bluttered\") is true, then the result (\"it surned\") must also be true. However, we know from the first statement that \"it surned\" is not true (\"The fleeg did not surn\").\n\nTherefore, since the result is false, the condition must also be false. In other words, because the fleeg did not surn, it could not have been bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes."
