We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The clug did not snugged\"\n2. \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be written as \"Fleeked(clug) \u2192 Snugged(clug)\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"\u00acSnugged(clug) \u2192 \u00acFleeked(clug)\", which means \"If the clug did not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked\".\n\nGiven the first statement, \"The clug did not snugged\", we can apply the contrapositive and infer that \"The clug was not fleeked\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
