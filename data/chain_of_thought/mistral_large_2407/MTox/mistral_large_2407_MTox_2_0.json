We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The wug did not bim the zoint.\"\n2. \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional, meaning that if the condition (\"the wug was flooped\") is true, then the result (\"the wug bimmed the zoint\") must also be true. However, we know from the first statement that \"the wug bimmed the zoint\" is not true. Therefore, the condition (\"the wug was flooped\") cannot be true either, because if it were, it would make the result true, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes."
