We are also given that 'If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged'. This can be rephrased as 'If the glip was tragged, then the glip was slogged' because of the contrapositive equivalence in logic.\n3. Since we know the glip was not tragged, we can use the contrapositive of the second statement to infer that the glip was also not slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes"
