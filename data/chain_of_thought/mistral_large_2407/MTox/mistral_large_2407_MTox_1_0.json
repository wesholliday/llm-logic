If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer that \"The flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\nTo do this, let's use a form of logical reasoning called modus tollens, which states that if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\nIn this case, let P be \"the flugel was blimmed\" and Q be \"the flugel was zargled.\" We know from the second statement that P implies Q. We also know from the first statement that Q is false (the flugel was not zargled). Therefore, according to modus tollens, P must also be false.\n\nSo, we can indeed infer that \"The flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
