We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The fribble did not crink.\"\n2. \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional, telling us that if the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked. However, from the first statement, we know that the fribble did not crink. Therefore, the condition of crinking is not met, which implies that the fribble could not have been snurgled, because if it were, it would have crinked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
