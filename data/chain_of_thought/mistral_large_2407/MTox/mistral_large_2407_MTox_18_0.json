If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that \"The shank was not plooked.\"\n\nTo do this, we can use a form of logical reasoning called modus tollens, which states that if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\nIn this case, let P be \"the shank was plooked\" and Q be \"the shank was nugged.\" We know that Q is false (the shank was not nugged). Therefore, if P implied Q (if the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged), and Q is false, then P must also be false (the shank was not plooked).\n\nAnswer: yes"
