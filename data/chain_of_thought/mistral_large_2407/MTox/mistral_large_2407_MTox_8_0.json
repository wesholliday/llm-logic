If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be rephrased as \"If the sprocket was cranked, then it would be daggled.\" However, we know from the first statement that the sprocket was not daggled. Therefore, the condition of being cranked leading to being daggled cannot have occurred. Thus, we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
