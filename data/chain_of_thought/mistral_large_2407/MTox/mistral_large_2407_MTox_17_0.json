We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The flob did not movated.\"\n2. \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (\"the flob was skizzled\") is true, then the result (\"the flob movated\") must also be true. However, we know from the first statement that \"the flob did not movated.\" This means the result of the conditional statement is false. Therefore, the condition must also be false (because if the condition were true, the result would have to be true as well). So, we can infer that \"The flob was not skizzled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
