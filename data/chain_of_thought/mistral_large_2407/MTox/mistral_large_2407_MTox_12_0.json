We are also given that \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q.\"\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The smip was not shripped,\" we can use the contrapositive of the given conditional statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\n3. The contrapositive of \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint\" is \"If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped.\"\n\n4. Since we know that \"The smip did not lup the zoint,\" we can apply the contrapositive and infer that \"The smip was not shripped.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
