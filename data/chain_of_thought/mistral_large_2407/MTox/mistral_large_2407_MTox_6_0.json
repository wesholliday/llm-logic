We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The grommet did not plop the frink.\"\n2. \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (\"the grommet was sploffed\") is true, then the result (\"the grommet plopped the frink\") must also be true.\n\nHowever, we know from the first statement that the result is not true (\"the grommet did not plop the frink\"). Therefore, the condition cannot be true either. So, we can infer that \"The grommet was not sploffed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
