If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\n\nFrom the second statement, we can infer that if the twonk was not varnished, then it could not have been plinked (because plinking leads to varnishing). Since we know from the first statement that the twonk was not varnished, we can conclude that the twonk was not plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
