We are also given that \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\" This can be written in logical form as: Morphed(splat) \u2192 Quanked(splat).\n3. Since we know that the splat did not quank, we can write this as \u00acQuanked(splat).\n4. Using the contrapositive of the second statement, we get: \u00acQuanked(splat) \u2192 \u00acMorphed(splat).\n5. Applying modus ponens to the contrapositive and the first statement, we can infer that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
