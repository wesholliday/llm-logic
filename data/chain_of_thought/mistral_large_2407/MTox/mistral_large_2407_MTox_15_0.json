We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The dreb was not spened.\"\n2. \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. If we assume \"the dreb was vroombed\" is true, then according to the second statement, \"the dreb was spened\" must also be true. However, we know from the first statement that \"the dreb was not spened.\" Therefore, our assumption that \"the dreb was vroombed\" must be false, because it leads to a contradiction. So, we can infer that \"the dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
