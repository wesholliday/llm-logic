We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The whiffle did not tink.\"\n2. \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\"\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The whiffle was not shanked.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional, meaning if the condition (\"the whiffle was shanked\") is true, then the result (\"the whiffle tinked\") must also be true. However, we know from the first statement that the result is false (\"the whiffle did not tink\"). Therefore, for the second statement to hold true, the condition must also be false. In other words, if the whiffle did not tink, then it could not have been shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes."
