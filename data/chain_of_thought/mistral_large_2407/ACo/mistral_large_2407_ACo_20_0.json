            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" implies that a red apple is a sufficient condition for the banana to be yellow. However, it does not mean that it is a necessary condition. In other words, the banana could be yellow for other reasons, not just because the apple is red. Therefore, knowing that the banana was yellow does not necessarily mean that the apple was red.\n\nAnswer: no"
