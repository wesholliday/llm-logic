This is a logical implication (If Alex finished \u2192 Chris finished). However, we cannot reverse this implication. Just because Chris finished the race does not necessarily mean that Alex also finished the race. The information given does not provide any details about Alex's completion of the race. Therefore, we cannot infer that Alex finished the race based solely on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
