However, it does not imply the reverse; that is, if \"the truck was metal,\" it does not necessarily mean that \"the doll was plastic.\" There could be other reasons why the truck is metal. Therefore, from the given statements, we cannot logically infer that \"The doll was plastic.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
