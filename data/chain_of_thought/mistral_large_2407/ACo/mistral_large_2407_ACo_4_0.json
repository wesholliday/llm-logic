However, it does not provide any information about what happens if \"the robot visited Jupiter\" is true. In other words, the robot visiting Jupiter does not necessarily mean that the alien visited Mars, as there could be other reasons for the robot visiting Jupiter. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The alien visited Mars\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
