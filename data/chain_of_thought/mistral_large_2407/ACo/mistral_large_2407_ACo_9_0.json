            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement that only tells us what happens if Lisa bought the red shirt. It doesn't give us any information about whether Lisa actually bought the red shirt or not. The fact that Mark bought the blue shirt doesn't necessarily mean that Lisa bought the red shirt, because other conditions could have led to Mark buying the blue shirt. Therefore, we cannot infer that Lisa bought the red shirt based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
