            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' implies that Sue's presence at the wedding is a necessary condition if Mary was there. However, it does not imply that Mary's presence is necessary for Sue to be there. In other words, Sue could be at the wedding regardless of whether Mary was there or not. Therefore, knowing that Sue was at the wedding does not allow us to infer that Mary was also there.\n\nAnswer: no"
