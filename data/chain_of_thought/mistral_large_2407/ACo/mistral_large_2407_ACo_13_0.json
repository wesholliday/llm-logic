However, it does not provide any information about what happens when the truck is blue. In other words, just because the truck is blue, we cannot conclude that the car was red. The truck being blue could be true for other reasons not mentioned in the given statements. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The car was red\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
