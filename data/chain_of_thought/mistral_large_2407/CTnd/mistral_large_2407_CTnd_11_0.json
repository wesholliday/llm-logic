            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is \"If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"I went to the store\" and Q is \"I did not buy vegetables.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store.\" This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" So, the contrapositive of \"If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables\" is \"If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store.\"\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
