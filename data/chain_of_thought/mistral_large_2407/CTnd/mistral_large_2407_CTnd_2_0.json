            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then not Q\" (where P is \"Ann exercised\" and Q is \"Ann exercised strenuously\"). The question asks if we can infer the statement \"If Q, then not P\". To determine this, we need to consider the logical relationship between these statements.\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\", and it is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, the statement we are asked to infer is not the contrapositive; it is the inverse (or the converse of the negation) of the original statement. The inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot logically infer \"If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise\" from \"If Ann exercised, then she did not exercise strenuously\".\n\nAnswer: no"
