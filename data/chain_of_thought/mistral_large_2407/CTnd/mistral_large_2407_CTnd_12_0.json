            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is \"If Jane studied, then she did not study long.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Jane studied\" and Q is \"she did not study long.\" The question asks if we can infer \"If Jane studied long, then she did not study,\" which is of the form \"If not Q, then not P.\" This is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning if one is true, the other must also be true. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the inferred statement is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
