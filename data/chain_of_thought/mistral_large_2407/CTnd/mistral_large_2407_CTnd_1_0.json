            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is \"If it's raining, then it's not raining hard.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"it's raining\" and Q is \"it's not raining hard.\" The question asks if we can infer \"If it's raining hard, then it's not raining,\" which is of the form \"If not Q, then not P.\" This is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are always logically equivalent, meaning if one is true, the other must also be true. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the inferred statement must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
