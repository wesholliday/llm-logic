The original statement is of the form \"If P, then not Q,\" where P is \"advice was offered\" and Q is \"the advice was helpful.\"\n\nThe inference is of the form \"If Q, then not P.\" This is not a logically valid inference from the original statement. The original statement does not provide any information about what happens if helpful advice is offered; it only tells us about the nature of the advice if any advice is offered.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered\" from \"If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
