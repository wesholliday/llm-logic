However, the statement \"If Q, then not P\" is not the contrapositive of the original statement; instead, it is the inverse, which is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer \"If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
