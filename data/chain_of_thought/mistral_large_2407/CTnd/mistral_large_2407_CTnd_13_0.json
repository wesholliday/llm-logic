However, the statement in question, \"If Q, then not P,\" is not the contrapositive of the original statement; instead, it is the inverse (or the converse of the negation) of the original statement. The inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise\" from \"If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
