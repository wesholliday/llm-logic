In formal logic, P \u2192 \u00acQ is equivalent to \u00acP \u2228 \u00acQ (either not P or not Q). However, Q \u2192 \u00acP is equivalent to \u00acQ \u2228 \u00acP (either not Q or not P). These two statements are not logically equivalent, and one does not necessarily follow from the other.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer Q \u2192 \u00acP from P \u2192 \u00acQ.\n\nAnswer: no"
