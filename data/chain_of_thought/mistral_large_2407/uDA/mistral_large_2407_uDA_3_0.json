However, the fact is that James did not write the book. The information does not provide any details about who wrote the book or its genre, other than the scenario where James is the author. Since the book was not written by James, we cannot use the given implication to determine the genre of the book. Therefore, we cannot infer that the book is not a mystery novel based solely on the provided information.\n\nAnswer: no"
