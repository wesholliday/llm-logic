The alien did not visit Mars.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that the robot visiting Jupiter depends on the alien visiting Mars. However, the second statement tells us that the alien did not visit Mars. Since the condition for the robot visiting Jupiter is not met (because the alien did not visit Mars), we can infer that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: yes"
