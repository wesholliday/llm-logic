However, it is stated that the cake was not chocolate. Since the condition (the cake being chocolate) for the muffins to be blueberry is not met, we cannot directly infer that the muffins were blueberry. However, the statement does not provide any information about what kind of muffins there were when the cake is not chocolate. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude what kind of muffins there were based on the given information alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
