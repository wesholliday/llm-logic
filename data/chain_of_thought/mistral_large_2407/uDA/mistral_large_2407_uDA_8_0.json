            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" and \"the vampire was not awake.\" The first statement is a conditional, meaning that the mummy being awake depends on the vampire being awake. However, since the second statement tells us that the vampire was not awake, the condition for the mummy being awake is not met. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the mummy was awake. Since the mummy's state of awakeness is not explicitly stated and is only dependent on the vampire being awake, which it is not, we can infer that the mummy was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes"
