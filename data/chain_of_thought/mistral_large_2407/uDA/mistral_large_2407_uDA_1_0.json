            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" implies that Sue's presence is dependent on Mary's presence. However, it does not provide any information about Sue's presence if Mary is not there. Since the second statement tells us that Mary was not at the wedding, we have no information to confirm or deny Sue's presence. Therefore, we cannot infer that Sue was not at the wedding based solely on these statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
