The conditional statement is \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" The fact is \"Sue did not choose pizza.\" Since the condition (Sue choosing pizza) for Bob choosing pasta is not met, we cannot directly infer anything about Bob's choice based on the given information. The statement does not provide any information about what Bob chooses if Sue does not choose pizza. Therefore, we cannot infer that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: no"
