The conditional statement is \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" The fact is \"Alex did not finish the race.\" Since the condition (Alex finishing the race) for Chris to finish the race is not met, we cannot use this conditional statement to conclude anything about Chris. The information about Chris finishing the race is not provided, so we cannot infer that Chris did not finish the race based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
