            "content": "Explanation: The given information presents a conditional statement and its negation. The statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" The negation is \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" Since the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) for Mark buying the blue shirt is not met, we cannot conclude that Mark bought the blue shirt. However, we also cannot definitively conclude that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, as the information given does not provide any insight into Mark's actions outside of the conditional statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt based solely on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no"
