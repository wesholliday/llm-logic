            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" and \"the shirt was not cotton.\" These statements establish a conditional relationship between the material of the shirt and the pants. However, the conditional statement only tells us what happens when the shirt is cotton; it does not provide information about what happens when the shirt is not cotton. Since the shirt is not cotton, we cannot use the given conditional statement to infer anything about the material of the pants. Therefore, we cannot infer that the pants were not denim based solely on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no"
