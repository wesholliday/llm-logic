            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement that says if the car was red, then the truck was blue. However, it is also given that the car was not red. Since the condition (the car being red) for the truck to be blue is not met, we cannot conclude that the truck was blue. But, importantly, we also cannot conclude that the truck was not blue; the truck's color is unknown and not determined by the given information when the car is not red.\n\nAnswer: no"
