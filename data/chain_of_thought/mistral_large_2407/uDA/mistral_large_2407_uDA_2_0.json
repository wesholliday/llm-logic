            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are structured as a logical implication and a negation. The first statement says that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is also in the forest. This can be written as \"If Griffin, then Unicorn.\" The second statement tells us that the griffin is not in the forest. Since the griffin is not in the forest, the condition for the unicorn to be in the forest (which is the griffin being in the forest) is not met. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the unicorn is in the forest based on these statements. However, the statements do not provide any information about the unicorn's location when the griffin is not in the forest, so we also cannot definitively conclude that the unicorn is not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no"
