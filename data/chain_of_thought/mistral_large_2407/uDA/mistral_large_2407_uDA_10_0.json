The dog was not inside.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know the dog was not inside. The first statement only tells us what happens if the dog was inside, but since the dog was not inside, the first statement doesn't apply. Therefore, we have no information about the cat's location. We cannot infer anything about the cat being outside or not.\n\nAnswer: no"
