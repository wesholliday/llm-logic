Sam did not take a plane.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that Erin taking the train is dependent on Sam taking a plane. However, since the second statement tells us that Sam did not take a plane, the condition for Erin taking the train is not met. Therefore, we cannot infer that Erin took the train, but we also cannot infer that she did not take the train, as the information given does not provide enough evidence to support either conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
