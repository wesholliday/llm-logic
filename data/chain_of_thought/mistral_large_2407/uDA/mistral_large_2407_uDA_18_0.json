The doll was not plastic.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement (if A, then B). The second statement tells us that the condition (A) is not true. When the condition of a conditional statement is not true, the statement does not provide any information about the conclusion (B). In other words, if the doll is not plastic, the first statement does not tell us anything about whether the truck is metal or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that the truck was not metal based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
