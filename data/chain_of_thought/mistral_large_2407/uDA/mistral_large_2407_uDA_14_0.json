            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements:\n\n1. If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n2. The bear was not in the cave.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that the wolf being in the den depends on the bear being in the cave. However, the second statement tells us that the bear was not in the cave. Since the condition for the wolf being in the den is not met (because the bear is not in the cave), we cannot conclude that the wolf was in the den. Therefore, we can infer that the wolf was not in the den.\n\nAnswer: yes"
