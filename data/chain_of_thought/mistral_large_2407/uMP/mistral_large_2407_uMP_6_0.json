This can be written logically as \"If Sue = Pizza, then Bob = Pasta\". The second piece of information is that Sue indeed chose pizza. Given this information, we can use the first statement to infer that Bob must have chosen pasta, as the condition for Bob choosing pasta (Sue choosing pizza) is met.\n\nAnswer: yes"
