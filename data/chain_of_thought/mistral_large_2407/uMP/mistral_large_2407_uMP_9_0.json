This can be written as a conditional statement: If Lisa -> Mark. The second piece of information is that Lisa did indeed buy the red shirt. Given this information, we can use the first statement to infer that Mark must have bought the blue shirt, as the condition for Mark buying the blue shirt (Lisa buying the red shirt) has been met.\n\nAnswer: yes"
