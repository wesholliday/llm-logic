The first statement is a conditional: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" The second statement affirms the condition: \"The book was written by James.\" According to the logical rule known as modus ponens, if the condition is true, then the consequence must also be true. Therefore, if James wrote the book, and we know that whenever James writes a book it is a mystery novel, we can conclude that the book in question is indeed a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: yes"
