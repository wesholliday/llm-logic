            "content": "Explanation: The statement gives us two pieces of information. First, it tells us that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was also awake. This can be written logically as \"If Vampire Awake \u2192 Mummy Awake\". The second piece of information is that the vampire was indeed awake, which is \"Vampire Awake = True\". Using the first statement, if the condition \"Vampire Awake\" is true, then the consequence \"Mummy Awake\" must also be true. Therefore, given that the vampire was awake, we can logically infer that the mummy was awake.\n\nAnswer: yes"
