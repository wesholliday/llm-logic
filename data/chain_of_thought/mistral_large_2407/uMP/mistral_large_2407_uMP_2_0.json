This can be written as a conditional statement: \"If griffin, then unicorn.\" The second piece of information is that the griffin is indeed in the forest. According to the conditional statement, since the griffin is in the forest, it follows that the unicorn must be in the forest as well.\n\nAnswer: yes"
