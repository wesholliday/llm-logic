The quorple must be at snork gribble.\n2. The quorple must be in the wibble plonk.\n\nThe phrase \"it must be\" is simply repeated for emphasis and clarity, but it does not change the logical structure of the statement. When we combine these conditions, we get \"The quorple must be at snork gribble and in the wibble plonk,\" which maintains the same meaning as the original statement. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes."
