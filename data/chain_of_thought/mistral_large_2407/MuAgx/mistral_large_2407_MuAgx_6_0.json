            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is \"The wobble must be wumble fizzle and it must frazzle at wozzle zump.\" The question asks if we can infer \"The wobble must be wumble fizzle and frazzle at wozzle zump.\" The only difference between the two statements is the removal of the word \"it\" in the second part of the sentence. However, the meaning of the sentence remains the same because \"it\" refers to \"the wobble,\" which is already the subject of the sentence. Therefore, removing \"it\" does not change the inferred meaning.\n\nAnswer: yes"
