It must be floob with crunk.\n2. It must be plonk zibber flonk.\n\nThe inferred statement combines these two requirements into a single sentence without changing their meaning. The use of \"and\" in the original statement indicates that both conditions must be met, which is maintained in the inferred statement.\n\nTherefore, the inferred statement accurately reflects the original statement's requirements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
