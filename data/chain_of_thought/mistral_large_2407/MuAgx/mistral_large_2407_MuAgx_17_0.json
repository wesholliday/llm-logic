The zazzle must be flonk by crunk.\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"The zazzle must be crunk and flonk by crunk.\" This inferred statement also has two requirements:\n1. The zazzle must be crunk.\n2. The zazzle must be flonk by crunk.\n\nSince both statements have the same requirements, just phrased differently, the meaning remains the same. Therefore, we can indeed infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
