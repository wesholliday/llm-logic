            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\". In logic, if \"If P, then Q\" is true and \"Q\" is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that \"P\" is true. This is because \"If P, then Q\" only tells us that whenever P is true, Q must be true; it doesn't tell us anything about the situations where Q is true but P might not be. However, in this specific case, we are given that both the conditional statement and its consequent (\"The mummy was awake\") are true. The only way for both of these to be true is if the antecedent (\"The vampire was awake\") is also true. If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy would not be awake, which would contradict the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
