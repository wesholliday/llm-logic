            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\". In logic, if \"If P, then Q\" is true and Q is true, it does not necessarily mean that P is true. This is because P might not be the only condition that leads to Q. In this case, even though the book is a mystery novel, it could have been written by someone other than James. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"The book was written by James\" is true based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
