However, the truth of the consequence (Kate ate salad) does not necessarily imply the truth of the condition (Ben ate pasta). In other words, just because Kate ate salad, it does not mean that Ben must have eaten pasta. Kate could have eaten salad for other reasons, not necessarily because Ben ate pasta.\n\nAnswer: no"
