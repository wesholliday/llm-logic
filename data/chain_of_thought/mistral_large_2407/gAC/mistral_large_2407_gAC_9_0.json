            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the second part (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true. However, the truth of the second part does not necessarily imply the truth of the first part. In other words, just because Mark bought the blue shirt, we cannot conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt. The information given does not provide enough evidence to determine whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not.\n\nAnswer: no"
