            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q.\" We are given that Q (\"The truck was metal\") is true. However, in a conditional statement, the truth of Q does not necessarily imply the truth of P. In other words, just because the truck was metal, it does not mean that the doll was definitely plastic. The doll could be plastic, or it could be made of another material. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that \"The doll was plastic\" is true based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no"
