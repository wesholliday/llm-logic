            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement that can be written as \"Mary at wedding \u2192 Sue at wedding.\" This statement tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there as well. However, it does not provide any information about whether Mary was actually at the wedding or not. The second statement \"Sue was at the wedding\" confirms Sue's presence but does not give us any information about Mary's presence. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Mary was at the wedding based solely on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
