            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q.\" We are given that Q (\"The pants were denim\") is true. However, in a conditional statement, the truth of Q does not necessarily imply the truth of P. In other words, just because the pants were denim, it does not mean that the shirt was definitely cotton; the shirt could be made of another material. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"The shirt was cotton\" is true based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no"
