Therefore, P.\n\nThis is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The truth of Q does not necessarily guarantee the truth of P. In other words, just because the truck was blue, it does not mean that the car was definitely red; the car could have been any color. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no."
