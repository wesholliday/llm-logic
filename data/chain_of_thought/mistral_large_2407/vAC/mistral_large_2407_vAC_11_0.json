Therefore, P.\n\nThis is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The structure of the argument is not logically valid because the truth of the consequent (Q) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (P). In other words, just because the muffins were blueberry, it does not logically follow that the cake was chocolate; there could be other reasons for the muffins being blueberry.\n\nAnswer: no."
