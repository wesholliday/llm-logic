If P, then Q (If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel)\n2. Q (The book is a mystery novel)\n3. Therefore, P (The book was written by James)\n\nThis form of argument is not logically valid because the truth of the consequent (Q) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (P). In other words, just because the book is a mystery novel does not mean it was necessarily written by James; there could be other authors who write mystery novels.\n\nAnswer: no"
