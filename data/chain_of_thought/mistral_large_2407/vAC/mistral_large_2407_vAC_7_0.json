If P, then Q (where P is \"Alex finished the race\" and Q is \"Chris finished the race\")\n2. Q is true\n3. Therefore, P is true\n\nThis is a form of argument known as affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy. The reason it is a fallacy is because the truth of Q does not necessarily guarantee the truth of P. In other words, just because Chris finished the race, it does not mean that Alex must have finished the race. Other possibilities could exist, such as Chris finishing the race without Alex finishing it.\n\nAnswer: no"
