If P, then Q (If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den)\n2. Q (The wolf was in the den)\n3. Therefore, P (The bear was in the cave)\n\nThis form of argument is invalid because the truth of the consequent (Q) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (P). In other words, just because the wolf was in the den, it does not logically follow that the bear was in the cave; there could be other reasons for the wolf being in the den.\n\nAnswer: no"
