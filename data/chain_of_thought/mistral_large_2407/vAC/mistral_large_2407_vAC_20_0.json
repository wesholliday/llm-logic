If P, then Q (If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow)\n2. Q (The banana was yellow)\n3. Therefore, P (The apple was red)\n\nThis form of argument is known as affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy. The truth of the consequent (Q) does not necessarily guarantee the truth of the antecedent (P). In other words, just because the banana was yellow, it does not logically follow that the apple was red; there could be other reasons for the banana being yellow.\n\nAnswer: no"
