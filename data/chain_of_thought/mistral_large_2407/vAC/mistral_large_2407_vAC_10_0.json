If P, then Q (If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside)\n2. Q (The cat was outside)\n3. Therefore, P (The dog was inside)\n\nThis form of argument is known as affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy. The truth of the consequent (Q) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (P). In other words, just because the cat was outside, it does not logically follow that the dog was inside; there could be other reasons for the cat being outside.\n\nAnswer: no"
