If P, then Q (If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train)\n2. Q (Erin took a train)\n3. Therefore, P (Sam took a plane)\n\nIn this form, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises. Just because Erin took a train, it does not mean that Sam took a plane; Erin could have taken a train for other reasons. To be valid, the argument should be in the form of modus ponens (If P, then Q; P; therefore, Q) or modus tollens (If P, then Q; not-Q; therefore, not-P).\n\nAnswer: no"
