Therefore, P.\n\nThis is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises. Just because Q is true (Mark bought the blue shirt), it does not mean that P (Lisa bought the red shirt) must be true. There could be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt, not necessarily because Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no."
