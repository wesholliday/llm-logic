Therefore, P.\n\nThis is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The truth of Q does not necessarily guarantee the truth of P. In other words, just because the robot visited Jupiter (Q), it does not logically follow that the alien visited Mars (P). There could be other reasons why the robot visited Jupiter that are unrelated to the alien visiting Mars.\n\nAnswer: no."
