Therefore, P.\n\nThis is a form of the fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\" In a valid argument, the truth of the premises should guarantee the truth of the conclusion. However, in this case, just because Q (Bob chose pasta) is true and P implies Q, it does not necessarily mean that P (Sue chose pizza) must be true. There could be other reasons why Bob chose pasta besides Sue choosing pizza.\n\nAnswer: no."
