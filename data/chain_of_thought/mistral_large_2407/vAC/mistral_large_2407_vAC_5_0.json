If P, then Q (If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis)\n2. Q (Amy played tennis)\n3. Therefore, P (Jeff played basketball)\n\nThis form of argument is invalid because the truth of the consequent (Q) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (P). In other words, just because Amy played tennis, it does not logically follow that Jeff played basketball; there could be other reasons why Amy played tennis.\n\nAnswer: no"
