If P, then Q (If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal)\n2. Q (The truck was metal)\n3. Therefore, P (The doll was plastic)\n\nThis is a form of the logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\" The valid form would be \"Modus Ponens,\" which is:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. P\n3. Therefore, Q\n\nIn the given argument, the second premise affirms the consequent (Q) of the first premise and then asserts the antecedent (P). This is not a logically valid form because the truth of Q does not necessarily imply the truth of P; there could be other reasons why Q is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
