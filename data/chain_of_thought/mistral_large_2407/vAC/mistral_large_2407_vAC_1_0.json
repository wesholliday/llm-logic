            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its structure. The argument is structured as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q (If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding)\n2. Q (Sue was at the wedding)\n3. Therefore, P (Mary was at the wedding)\n\nThis form of argument is known as affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy. The conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises. Just because Sue was at the wedding, it does not mean that Mary was there, even if it's true that if Mary were there, Sue would be too.\n\nAnswer: no"
