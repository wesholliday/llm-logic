If P, then Q (If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo)\n2. Q (Lucy went to the zoo)\n3. Therefore, P (Joe went to the park)\n\nThis is a form of the fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\" The valid form of this argument would be \"Modus Ponens,\" which has the form:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. P\n3. Therefore, Q\n\nIn the given argument, the second premise affirms the consequent (Q) of the first premise and then asserts the antecedent (P). This is not a logically valid form of argument because the truth of the consequent (Q) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (P). There could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo that are not dependent on Joe going to the park.\n\nAnswer: no"
