Therefore, P.\n\nThis is a form of the fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\" In a valid argument, the truth of the premises should guarantee the truth of the conclusion. However, in this case, just because Q is true (Jen watched basketball) does not necessarily mean that P is true (Tom watched football). There could be other reasons why Jen watched basketball that are unrelated to Tom watching football.\n\nAnswer: no."
