If P, then Q (If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad)\n2. Q (Kate ate salad)\n3. Therefore, P (Ben ate pasta)\n\nThis is a form of argument known as \"affirming the consequent.\" It is a logical fallacy because the truth of the consequent (Q) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (P). In other words, just because Kate ate salad, it does not necessarily mean that Ben ate pasta; there could be other reasons why Kate ate salad.\n\nAnswer: no"
