If P, then Q (If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest)\n2. Q (The unicorn was in the forest)\n3. Therefore, P (The griffin was in the forest)\n\nThis is a form of the logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\" The valid form would be \"Modus Ponens,\" which is:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. P\n3. Therefore, Q\n\nIn the given argument, the second premise affirms the consequent (Q) of the first premise and then asserts the antecedent (P). This is not a logically valid form of argument.\n\nAnswer: no"
