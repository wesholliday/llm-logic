The structure is as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q (If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake)\n2. Q (The mummy was awake)\n3. Therefore, P (The vampire was awake)\n\nHowever, the correct form of modus ponens should be:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. P\n3. Therefore, Q\n\nIn this case, the argument has the second premise as Q instead of P. This is actually a form of the fallacy known as affirming the consequent. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
