            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the wug was sproinged\" and Q is \"the wug was garpled.\" To infer \"If Q, then P\" from \"If P, then Q\" is a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. Just because P leads to Q does not mean that Q necessarily leads to P. There could be other reasons why the wug was garpled besides it being sproinged. Therefore, we cannot logically infer \"If the wug was garpled, then it was sproinged\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
