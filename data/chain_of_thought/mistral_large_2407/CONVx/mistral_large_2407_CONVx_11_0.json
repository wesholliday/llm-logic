In logic, \"If P, then Q\" does not imply \"If Q, then P.\" For example, \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\" does not imply \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining\" because the ground could be wet for other reasons. Similarly, the flug could be zimmed for reasons other than being blummed. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the flug was zimmed, then the flug was blummed\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
