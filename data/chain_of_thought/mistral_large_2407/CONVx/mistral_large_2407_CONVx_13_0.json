The question asks if we can infer the converse, \"If Q, then P\". In logic, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. Just because P implies Q, it does not mean that Q implies P. Additional information would be needed to establish the truth of the converse. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the glip was tragged, then the glip was slogged\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
