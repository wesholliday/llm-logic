In logic, a disjunction (or) is true if at least one of the statements is true. Therefore, if \"The report must have been accurate\" is true, then the disjunction \"The report must have been accurate or detailed\" is also true, because at least one of the conditions (accurate) is met.\n\nAnswer: yes"
