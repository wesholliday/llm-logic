            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The medicine must have been taken with food\" specifies only one condition for taking the medicine, which is \"with food.\" The phrase \"with food\" typically implies that the medicine should be taken while eating or immediately before or after eating. The phrase \"after meals\" is a subset of \"with food,\" as it specifies a more precise timing within the broader condition of taking the medicine with food. Therefore, if the medicine must be taken with food, it logically follows that it can be taken during or after meals, as both scenarios involve the presence of food.\n\nAnswer: yes"
