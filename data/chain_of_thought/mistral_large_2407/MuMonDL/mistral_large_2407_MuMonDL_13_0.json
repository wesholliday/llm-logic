            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The movie must have been in English\" specifies that the language of the movie itself was English. It does not provide any information about the presence or absence of subtitles. The inference \"The movie must have been in English or had English subtitles\" includes an additional condition (had English subtitles) that is not necessarily true based on the original statement. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first, as it introduces an uncertainty that was not present in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
