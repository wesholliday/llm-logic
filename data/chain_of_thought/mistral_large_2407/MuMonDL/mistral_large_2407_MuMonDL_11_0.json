            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The software must have been updated\" is a specific claim about the software's status. When we consider the phrase \"The software must have been updated or replaced,\" we are introducing an additional possibility\u2014that the software could have been replaced instead of updated. Logically, if the software must have been updated, then it is also true that it must have been either updated or replaced, because the original statement is included as one of the possibilities in the second statement. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
