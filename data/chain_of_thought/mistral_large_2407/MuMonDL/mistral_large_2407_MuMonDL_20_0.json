            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The event must have been formal\" specifies a certain level of dress code or atmosphere. \"Formal\" is a broad category that can include various types of formal attire, one of which is \"black-tie.\" Since \"black-tie\" is a subset of \"formal,\" if an event is formal, it could indeed be black-tie, but it's not necessarily so\u2014it could also be another type of formal dress code. Therefore, the inference \"The event must have been formal or black-tie\" is logically valid because it includes the original statement's condition (\"formal\") and adds a more specific option (\"black-tie\") that is already included within the broader category.\n\nAnswer: yes"
