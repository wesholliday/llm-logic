It does not leave room for any other possibilities. The phrase \"or as requested\" introduces an alternative condition that is not present in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The room must have been cleaned daily or as requested\" from the original statement because it adds an additional condition that is not implied or stated in the original.\n\nAnswer: no"
