            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a logical disjunction (or) and a negation. The first statement, \"Either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag,\" can be represented as P or Q, where P is \"the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" and Q is \"the sunglasses are in her bag.\" The second statement, \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head,\" is the negation of P, represented as not P.\n\nIn logic, if we have a disjunction P or Q and we know that P is false (not P), then we can infer that Q must be true. This is because for the disjunction P or Q to be true, at least one of P or Q must be true. Since P is false, the only way for the disjunction to be true is if Q is true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
