            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a logical disjunction (or) and a negation. The first statement, \"Either the remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table,\" implies that at least one of these two conditions is true. The second statement, \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" negates the first condition. Therefore, if the remote control is not under the couch, the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that it is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes"
