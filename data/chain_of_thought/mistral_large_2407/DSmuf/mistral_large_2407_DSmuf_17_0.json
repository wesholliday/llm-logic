            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a logical disjunction (or) and a negation. The first statement, \"Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack,\" can be represented as P or Q, where P is \"the scarf must be draped on the coat rack\" and Q is \"the scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\" The second statement, \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack,\" is the negation of P, represented as not P.\n\nIn logic, if we have a disjunction (P or Q) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false (not P), then we can infer that the other disjunct must be true (Q). This is known as the disjunctive syllogism.\n\nTherefore, if \"the scarf must be draped on the coat rack\" is false, then \"the scarf is stuffed in my backpack\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes."
