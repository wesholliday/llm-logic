            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a logical disjunction (or) and a negation. The first statement, \"Either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer,\" can be represented as P or Q, where P is \"the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand\" and Q is \"the notebook is in the drawer.\" The second statement, \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand,\" is the negation of P, represented as not P.\n\nIn logic, if we have a disjunction P or Q and we know that P is false (not P), then we can infer that Q must be true. This is because for the disjunction P or Q to be true, at least one of P or Q must be true. If P is false, then Q must be true to satisfy the disjunction.\n\nTherefore, given that the notebook is not on the nightstand (not P), we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer (Q).\n\nAnswer: yes"
