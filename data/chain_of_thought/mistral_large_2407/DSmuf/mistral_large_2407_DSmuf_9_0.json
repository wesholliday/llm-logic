            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a disjunction (either A or B) and a negation of one part of the disjunction (not A). The disjunction states that the missing puzzle piece is either blending in on the floor or it is in the box. The negation states that it is not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor. When we have a disjunction and we negate one of the parts, the other part must be true. This is based on the logical principle known as disjunctive syllogism. Therefore, if it's not true that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor, then it must be true that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
