            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a logical disjunction (\"P or Q\") and a negation of one part of the disjunction (\"not P\"). Here, \"P\" is \"Fido must be in the garden\" and \"Q\" is \"Fido is inside\". The disjunction \"P or Q\" means that at least one of the statements P or Q is true. When we have \"not P\", it means P is false. So, if P is false and we know that \"P or Q\" is true, then Q must be true to satisfy the original disjunction. Therefore, if \"Fido must be in the garden\" is false, then \"Fido is inside\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
