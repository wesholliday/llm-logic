            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a logical disjunction (or) and a negation. The first statement \"Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer\" can be represented as P or Q, where P is \"the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" and Q is \"the keys are in the drawer\". The second statement is \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\", which is represented as not P.\n\nIn logic, if we have a disjunction (P or Q) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false (not P), then we can infer that the other disjunct must be true (Q). This is known as the disjunctive syllogism.\n\nTherefore, if \"the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" is not the case, then the keys must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
