            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a logical disjunction (or) and a negation. The first statement, \"Either the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box,\" implies that at least one of these conditions is true. The second statement, \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" negates the first condition. Therefore, if the toy is not on the bookshelf, the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
