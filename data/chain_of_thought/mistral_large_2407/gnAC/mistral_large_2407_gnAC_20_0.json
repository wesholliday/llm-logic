However, in logic, the truth of the consequent (Q) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (P). In other words, just because the banana was yellow does not mean that the apple was necessarily red. The banana could be yellow for other reasons independent of the apple's color. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"The apple was red\" is true based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no"
