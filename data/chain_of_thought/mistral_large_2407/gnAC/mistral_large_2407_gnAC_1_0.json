            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement that can be represented as \"Mary \u2192 Sue\". This means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there as well. However, it does not imply the reverse; that is, it does not guarantee that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary must have been there. The statement only provides information in one direction. Therefore, knowing that Sue was at the wedding does not necessarily mean that Mary was there.\n\nAnswer: no"
