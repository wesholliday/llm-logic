In this case, P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel\". Given that Q is true (\"The book is a mystery novel\"), we cannot necessarily conclude that P is true (\"The book was written by James\"). This is because the truth of Q only tells us that the condition is satisfied, but it does not guarantee that P is the reason for it. In other words, the book could be a mystery novel written by someone other than James.\n\nAnswer: no"
