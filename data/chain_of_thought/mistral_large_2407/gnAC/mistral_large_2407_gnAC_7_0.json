This statement does not imply that Alex finished the race; it only states that if Alex did, then Chris did as well. However, we are also given that 'Chris finished the race' is true. Since the conditional statement does not provide information in the reverse direction, knowing that Chris finished the race does not necessarily mean that Alex finished the race. The information given does not provide enough evidence to conclude that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: no"
