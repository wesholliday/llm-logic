            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" According to the rules of logic, if P \u2192 Q is true and Q is true, it does not necessarily mean that P is true. This is because P \u2192 Q only tells us that if P is true, then Q must be true; it does not tell us anything about the truth value of P when Q is true. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no"
