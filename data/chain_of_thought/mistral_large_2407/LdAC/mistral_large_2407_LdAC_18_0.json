            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is a conditional statement, which can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal.\" We are also given that Q is true (\"The truck was metal\"). However, in logic, the truth of the consequent (Q) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (P). In other words, just because the truck was metal, it does not mean that the doll was necessarily plastic. The truck being metal could be true regardless of the material of the doll. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce \"The doll was plastic\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
