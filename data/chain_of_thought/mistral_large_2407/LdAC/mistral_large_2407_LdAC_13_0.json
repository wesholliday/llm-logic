            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement, which can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\" We are also given that Q is true (\"The truck was blue\"). However, in logic, the truth of the consequent (Q) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (P). In other words, just because the truck was blue does not mean that the car was definitely red; the truck could be blue for other reasons. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce that the car was red based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
