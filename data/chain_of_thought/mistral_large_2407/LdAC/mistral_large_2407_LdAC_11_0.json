The second statement is 'The muffins were blueberry', which is Q. To deduce 'The cake was chocolate' (P) from Q, we would need to use the logical fallacy of affirming the consequent, which is not a valid form of reasoning. In other words, just because Q is true, it does not necessarily mean that P is true, as there could be other reasons why the muffins were blueberry.\n\nAnswer: no"
