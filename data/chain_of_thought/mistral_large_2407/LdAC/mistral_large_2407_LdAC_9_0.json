            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement that can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" The second statement is simply Q: \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" To deduce whether Lisa bought the red shirt, we need to consider the logical relationship between P and Q. In logic, P \u2192 Q does not imply Q \u2192 P. Just because Mark bought the blue shirt (Q is true), we cannot conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt (P is true). The original statement only tells us what happens if Lisa buys the red shirt; it does not tell us what happens if Mark buys the blue shirt. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
