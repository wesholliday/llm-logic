            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\". Here, P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow\". We are also given that Q is true (\"The banana was yellow\"). However, in logic, the truth of the consequent (Q) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (P). In other words, just because the banana was yellow does not mean that the apple was definitely red; the banana could be yellow for other reasons. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce \"The apple was red\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
