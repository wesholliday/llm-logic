The given information also includes the statement 'Bob chose pasta', which is Q. The logical fallacy here is known as 'affirming the consequent', where one assumes that because Q is true, P must also be true. However, this is not logically valid. For example, Bob could have chosen pasta regardless of what Sue chose. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce 'Sue chose pizza' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
