The statement is \"The frazzle must be snork with gribble or on an blimple grooble.\" This can be interpreted as \"The frazzle must be (snork with gribble) OR (on an blimple grooble).\" In logical terms, if A or B is true, it does not necessarily mean that B is true if A is not mentioned or proven false. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The frazzle must be on an blimple grooble\" from the given statement without additional information.\n\nAnswer: no"
