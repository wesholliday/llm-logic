However, we cannot infer from this that \"The snizzle must be shimble for flim flim\" because it is possible that the snizzle is only \"grooble on frazzle\" and not \"shimble for flim flim.\" In other words, the truth of the first condition does not guarantee the truth of the second condition.\n\nAnswer: no"
