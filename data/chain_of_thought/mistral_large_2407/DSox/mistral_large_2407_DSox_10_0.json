We are also given that \"Either the wug is sproinged or it is garpled.\"\n3. The second statement is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the conditions must be true.\n4. Since we know from the first statement that \"The wug is not garpled,\" the only remaining option from the second statement is that \"The wug is sproinged.\"\n5. Therefore, based on the information given, we can infer that \"The wug is sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
