We are given two statements:\n   - 'The splat is not quanked'\n   - 'Either the splat is morphed or it is quanked'\n\n2. The second statement is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the conditions must be true for the statement to be true.\n\n3. Since we know from the first statement that 'The splat is not quanked', the only way for the second statement to be true is if 'The splat is morphed'.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we can logically infer that 'The splat is morphed'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
