The second statement is \"Either the flug is blummed or it is zimmed.\" This can be written logically as \"Flug is blummed OR Flug is zimmed.\"\n3. Since we know from the first statement that \"The flug is not zimmed,\" the only option left in the second statement is that \"The flug is blummed.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"The flug is blummed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
