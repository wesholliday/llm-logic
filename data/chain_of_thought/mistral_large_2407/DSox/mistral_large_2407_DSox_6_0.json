We are also given that \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it is plopped.\"\n3. Since the grommet is not plopped (from step 1), the only option left in the second statement is that the grommet must be sploffed.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The grommet is sploffed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
