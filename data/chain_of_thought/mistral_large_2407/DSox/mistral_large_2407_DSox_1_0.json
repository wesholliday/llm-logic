We are given two statements:\n   - Statement 1: \"The flugel is not zargled.\"\n   - Statement 2: \"Either the flugel is blimmed or it is zargled.\"\n\n2. The second statement is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the conditions must be true for the statement to be true.\n\n3. Since we know from Statement 1 that \"The flugel is not zargled,\" the only way for Statement 2 to be true is if \"The flugel is blimmed.\"\n\n4. Therefore, based on the information given, we can logically infer that \"The flugel is blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
