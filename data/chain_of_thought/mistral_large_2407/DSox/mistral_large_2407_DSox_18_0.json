We are given two statements:\n   - Statement 1: \"The shank is not nugged.\"\n   - Statement 2: \"Either the shank is plooked or it is nugged.\"\n\n2. The second statement is a disjunction (an \"or\" statement). In logic, a disjunction is true if at least one of its parts is true.\n\n3. Since we know from Statement 1 that \"The shank is not nugged,\" the only way for Statement 2 to be true is if \"The shank is plooked\" is true.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the information given, we can infer that \"The shank is plooked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
