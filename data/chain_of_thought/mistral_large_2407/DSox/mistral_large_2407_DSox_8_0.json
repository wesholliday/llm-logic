We are also given that \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it is daggled.\"\n\nSince the sprocket is not daggled (from step 1), the only option left for the second statement to be true is that \"The sprocket is cranked.\" In logical terms, if we have not A (not daggled), and we know that A or B (daggled or cranked), then it must be B (cranked).\n\nAnswer: yes"
