We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The flob is not movated.\"\n2. \"Either the flob is skizzled or it is movated.\"\n\nThe second statement is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the conditions must be true. If \"the flob is movated\" were true, it would contradict the first statement. Since we know \"the flob is not movated\" from the first statement, the only way for the second statement to be true is if \"the flob is skizzled.\" Therefore, we can infer that \"the flob is skizzled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
