We are given two statements:\n   - Statement 1: \"The fribble is not crinked.\"\n   - Statement 2: \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it is crinked.\"\n\n2. The second statement presents a logical disjunction (an \"or\" condition). In logic, a disjunction is true if at least one of the conditions is true.\n\n3. Since Statement 1 asserts that \"The fribble is not crinked,\" we can eliminate the possibility that the fribble is crinked.\n\n4. Given that the fribble cannot be crinked (from Statement 1), the only remaining option from Statement 2 is that \"The fribble is snurgled.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can indeed infer that \"The fribble is snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
