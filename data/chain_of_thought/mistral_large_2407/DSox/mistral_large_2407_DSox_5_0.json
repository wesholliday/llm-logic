We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The zinger is not smoogled.\"\n2. \"Either the zinger is fraggled or it is smoogled.\"\n\nThe second statement is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the conditions must be true. If \"the zinger is smoogled\" were true, then the first statement would be false, which is a contradiction. Therefore, since the zinger is not smoogled, the only option left for the second statement to be true is that \"the zinger is fraggled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
