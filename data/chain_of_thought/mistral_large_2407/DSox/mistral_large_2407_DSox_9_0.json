We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The twonk is not plinked.\"\n2. \"Either the twonk is varnished or it is plinked.\"\n\nThe second statement is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the conditions must be true. If the twonk is not plinked (as stated in the first statement), then for the second statement to hold true, the twonk must be varnished. Because the twonk cannot be plinked (from the first statement), the only way to satisfy the second statement is if the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes"
