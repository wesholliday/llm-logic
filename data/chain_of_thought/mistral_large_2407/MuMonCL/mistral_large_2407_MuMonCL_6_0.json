            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM\" is a compound statement combining two independent clauses: \"The concert must have been sold out\" and \"the concert started at 8 PM.\" In logic, if a compound statement connected by \"and\" is true, then each of its individual components must also be true. Therefore, if the entire statement is true, we can indeed infer that \"The concert must have been sold out.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
