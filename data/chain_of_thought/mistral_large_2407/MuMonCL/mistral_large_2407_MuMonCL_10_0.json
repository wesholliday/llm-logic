            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document must have been signed and notarized\" implies two conditions: signing and notarization. If the document must have been signed and notarized, then it logically follows that it must have been signed, as signing is a necessary condition for the combined action of signing and notarizing. Therefore, we can infer that \"The document must have been signed\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
