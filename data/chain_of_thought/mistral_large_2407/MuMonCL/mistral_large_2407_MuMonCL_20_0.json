            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The event must have been formal and required tickets\" is a compound statement combining two conditions: the event was formal, and the event required tickets. Logically, if a compound statement using \"and\" is true, then each of its individual components must also be true. Therefore, if \"The event must have been formal and required tickets\" is true, it necessarily follows that \"The event must have been formal\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
