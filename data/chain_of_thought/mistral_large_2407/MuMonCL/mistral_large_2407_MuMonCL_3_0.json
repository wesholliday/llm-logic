            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The car must have been in the garage and needed repairs\" is a conjunction of two conditions: \"The car must have been in the garage\" and \"the car needed repairs.\" In logic, a conjunction is true only if both of its parts are true. Therefore, if the entire statement is true, then each part must also be true. This means that if \"The car must have been in the garage and needed repairs\" is true, then \"The car must have been in the garage\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
