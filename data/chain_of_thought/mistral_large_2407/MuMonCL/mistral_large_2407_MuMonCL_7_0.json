            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The exam must have been difficult and covered all chapters\" is a compound statement combining two conditions: the exam's difficulty and its coverage of all chapters. Logically, if the compound statement is true, then each individual part of the statement must also be true. Therefore, if \"The exam must have been difficult and covered all chapters\" is true, it follows that \"The exam must have been difficult\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
