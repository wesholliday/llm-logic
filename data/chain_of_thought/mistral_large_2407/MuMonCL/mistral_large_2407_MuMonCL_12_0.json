            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday and under budget\" is a compound statement combining two conditions: completion by Friday and being under budget. Logically, if both conditions must be true, then each condition individually must also be true. Therefore, if the project must have been completed by Friday and under budget, it necessarily follows that the project must have been completed by Friday.\n\nAnswer: yes"
