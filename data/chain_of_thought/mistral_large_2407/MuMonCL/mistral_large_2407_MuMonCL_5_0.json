            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for\" is a compound statement that combines two conditions: the package being delivered today and the package being signed for. The use of the word \"and\" in this context implies that both conditions must be true. Therefore, if the entire statement is true, then each individual part must also be true. This means that if the package must have been delivered today and signed for, it necessarily follows that the package must have been delivered today.\n\nAnswer: yes"
