            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The application must have been completed online and included references\" is a compound statement with two parts: \"The application must have been completed online\" and \"included references.\" The use of the conjunction \"and\" indicates that both conditions must be true. Therefore, if the entire statement is true, then each part of it must also be true on its own. This means that if the application must have been completed online and included references, it logically follows that the application must have been completed online.\n\nAnswer: yes"
