It can be broken down into two separate instructions: \"The medicine must have been taken with food\" and \"The medicine must have been taken twice daily.\" Since the first part, \"The medicine must have been taken with food,\" is explicitly stated within the compound instruction, it can be inferred from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
