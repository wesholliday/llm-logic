            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is an example of a conditional statement in logic, which can be written in the form \"If P, then Q\". The statement is \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob did not movated\", which can be rewritten as \"If P, then not Q\".\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is equivalent to its contrapositive \"If not Q, then not P\". This means that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nThe contrapositive of the given statement \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob did not movated\" is \"If the flob movated, then the flob was not skizzled\".\n\nTherefore, we can infer the contrapositive statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
