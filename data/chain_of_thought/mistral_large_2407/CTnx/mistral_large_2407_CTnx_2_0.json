            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the wug was flooped\" and Q is \"the wug did not bim the zoint\". The question asks if we can infer the statement \"If not Q, then not P\". This is a valid logical inference known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
