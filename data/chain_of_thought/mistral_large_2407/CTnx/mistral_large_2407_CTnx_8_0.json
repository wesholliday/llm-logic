            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and Q is \"the sprocket was not daggled\". The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of the statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P\". In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning if one is true, the other must also be true. Therefore, if \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled\" is true, then \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
