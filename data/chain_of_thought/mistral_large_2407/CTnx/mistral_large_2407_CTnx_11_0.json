            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the flug was blummed\" and Q is \"the flug was not zimmed\". The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of the statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P\". In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if one is true, the other must also be true. Therefore, if \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was not zimmed\" is true, then \"If the flug was zimmed, then the flug was not blummed\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
