            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and Q is \"the dreb was not spened\". The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of the statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P\". In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if one is true, the other must also be true. Therefore, if \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was not spened\" is true, then \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
