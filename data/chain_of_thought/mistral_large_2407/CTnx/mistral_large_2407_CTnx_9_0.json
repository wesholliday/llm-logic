            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the twonk was plinked\" and Q is \"it was not varnished\". The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P\". In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if one is true, the other must also be true. Therefore, if \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was not varnished\" is true, then \"If the twonk was varnished, then the twonk was not plinked\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
