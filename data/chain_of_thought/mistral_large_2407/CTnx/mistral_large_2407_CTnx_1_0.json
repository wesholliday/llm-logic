            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the flugel was blimmed\" and Q is \"the flugel was not zargled\". The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of the given statement. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning if one is true, the other must also be true. The contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". Therefore, the contrapositive of \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was not zargled\" is \"If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
