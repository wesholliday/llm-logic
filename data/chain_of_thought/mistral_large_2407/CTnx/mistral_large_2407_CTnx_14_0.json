            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the clug was fleeked\" and Q is \"the clug did not snugged\". The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P\". In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if one is true, the other must also be true. Therefore, if \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug did not snugged\" is true, then \"If the clug snugged, then the clug was not fleeked\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
