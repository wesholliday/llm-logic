The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is always logically equivalent to the original statement and is of the form \"If not Q, then not P\". In this case, the contrapositive is \"If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled\". Therefore, we can indeed infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
