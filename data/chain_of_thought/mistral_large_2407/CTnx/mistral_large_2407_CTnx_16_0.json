            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is an example of a conditional statement in logic, which can be written in the form \"If P, then Q\". The statement is \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg did not sproted the frink\", which can be rewritten as \"If P, then not Q\".\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is equivalent to its contrapositive \"If not Q, then not P\". Therefore, the contrapositive of \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg did not sproted the frink\" is \"If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled\".\n\nSince a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can indeed infer \"If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled\" from \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg did not sproted the frink\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
