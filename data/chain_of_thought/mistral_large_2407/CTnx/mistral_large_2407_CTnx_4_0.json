            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is an example of a conditional statement in logic, which can be written in the form \"If P, then Q\". The statement given is \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble did not crink\", which can be written as \"If P, then not Q\".\n\nThe question asks if we can infer the statement \"If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled\", which can be written as \"If Q, then not P\".\n\nAccording to the rules of logical inference, the statement \"If P, then not Q\" is logically equivalent to \"If Q, then not P\". This is known as the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer \"If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled\" from \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble did not crink\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
