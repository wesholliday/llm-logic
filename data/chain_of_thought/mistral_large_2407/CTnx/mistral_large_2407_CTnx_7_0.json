            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle did not tink,\" which can be written in logical terms as \"shanked \u2192 not tink.\" We are asked if we can infer \"If the whiffle tink, then the whiffle was not shanked,\" which is \"tink \u2192 not shanked.\"\n\nTo evaluate this, we can use the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"shanked \u2192 not tink\" is \"tink \u2192 not shanked.\" In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are always equivalent, meaning if one is true, the other is also true.\n\nTherefore, if the original statement is true, then the inferred statement \"If the whiffle tink, then the whiffle was not shanked\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
