            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the grommet was sploffed\" and Q is \"the grommet did not plop the frink\". The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is always logically equivalent to the original statement, and it is structured as \"If not Q, then not P\". So, the contrapositive of the given statement is \"If the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
