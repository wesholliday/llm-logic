            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the zinger was fraggled\" and Q is \"the zinger was not smoogled\". The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P\". In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if one is true, the other must also be true. Therefore, if \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled\" is true, then \"If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
