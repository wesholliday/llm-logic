            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the wug was sproinged\" and Q is \"it was not garpled\". The question asks if we can infer the statement \"If not Q, then not P\", which is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was not garpled\" is true, then \"If the wug was garpled, then the wug was not sproinged\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
