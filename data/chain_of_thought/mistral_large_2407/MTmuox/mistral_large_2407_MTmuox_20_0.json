However, the first statement tells us that the fleeg might not have been surned. Therefore, it cannot be the case that the fleeg was bluttered, because that would necessitate it being surned, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes"
