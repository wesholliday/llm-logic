We are given that \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled.\" This means that the sprocket might not have been daggled.\n2. We are also given that \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled.\" This means that cranking the sprocket necessarily leads to it being daggled.\n3. If the sprocket was cranked, then according to the second statement, it must have been daggled. But this contradicts the first statement, which says that it's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled.\n4. Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, we must conclude that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
