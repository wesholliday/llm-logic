The first statement is \"It's not the case that the smonk must have plagged.\" This can be rephrased as \"The smonk might not have plagged.\"\n2. The second statement is \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged.\" This is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between being vreebled and having plagged.\n\nNow, let's use these statements to determine if we can infer \"The smonk was not vreebled.\"\n\nIf the smonk was vreebled, according to the second statement, it must have plagged. However, the first statement tells us that it's not certain that the smonk must have plagged. Therefore, to avoid a contradiction, we must conclude that the smonk was not vreebled, because if it were, it would have certainly plagged, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
