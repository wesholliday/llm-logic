The first statement is \"It's not the case that the flugel must have been zargled.\" This can be rewritten as \"The flugel might not have been zargled.\"\n2. The second statement is \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled.\" This is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between being blimmed and being zargled.\n\nNow, let's use these statements to determine if we can infer \"The flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\nIf the flugel was blimmed, according to the second statement, it must have been zargled. However, the first statement tells us that it's not certain that the flugel was zargled. Therefore, to avoid a contradiction, we must conclude that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
