The first statement is 'It's not the case that the flob must have movated'. This can be rewritten as 'The flob did not necessarily movate'.\n2. The second statement is a conditional: 'If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated'. This means that being skizzled is a sufficient condition for the flob to have movated.\n3. Now, let's use contraposition of the second statement: 'If the flob did not movate, then the flob was not skizzled'.\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the flob did not necessarily movate, we can apply the contrapositive of the second statement to infer that 'The flob was not skizzled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
