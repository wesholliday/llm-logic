The first statement is \"It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink.\" This can be rewritten as \"The grommet did not plop the frink.\"\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional: \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink.\" This can be rewritten as \"If sploffed, then plopped.\"\n\nNow, let's use these statements to reason about whether the grommet was sploffed.\n\n- If the grommet was sploffed, according to the second statement, it must have plopped the frink.\n- However, we know from the first statement that the grommet did not plop the frink.\n- Therefore, the grommet could not have been sploffed, because if it were, it would have led to a contradiction with the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
