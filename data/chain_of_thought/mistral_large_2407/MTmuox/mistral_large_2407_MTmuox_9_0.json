We are given that \"It's not the case that the twonk must have been varnished.\" This means that the twonk might not have been varnished.\n2. We are also given that \"If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished.\" This means that if the twonk was plinked, then it necessarily follows that it was varnished.\n3. Now, let's consider if the twonk was plinked. If it was, then according to the second statement, it must have been varnished. But this contradicts the first statement, which says that it's not the case that the twonk must have been varnished.\n4. Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, we must conclude that the twonk was not plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
