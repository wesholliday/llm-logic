The first statement is \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have tinked.\" This can be rewritten as \"The whiffle did not necessarily tink.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked.\" This is a conditional statement that can be rewritten as \"Shanked whiffle implies tinked whiffle.\"\n\nNow, let's use these statements to see if we can infer \"The whiffle was not shanked.\"\n\n- If the whiffle was shanked, then according to the second statement, it must have tinked.\n- However, the first statement tells us that the whiffle did not necessarily tink.\n- Therefore, since the whiffle did not necessarily tink, it cannot be the case that the whiffle was shanked (because a shanked whiffle must have tinked).\n\nSo, based on the given statements, we can indeed infer that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
