            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a logical disjunction (or) and a negation. The first statement, \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table,\" can be represented as P or Q, where P is \"the book is on the shelf\" and Q is \"the book is resting on the table.\" The second statement, \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" is the negation of Q, represented as not Q.\n\nIn logic, if we have P or Q and we know that not Q is true, then it must be the case that P is true. This is because for the statement P or Q to be true, at least one of P or Q must be true. Since Q is false (not Q is true), the only way for P or Q to be true is if P is true.\n\nTherefore, given the two statements, we can infer that \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
