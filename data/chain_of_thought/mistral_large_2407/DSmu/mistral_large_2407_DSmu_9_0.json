            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a logical disjunction (or) and a negation. The first statement says that either the puzzle piece is in the box or it is blending in on the floor. The second statement negates the second part of the disjunction, stating that it's not the case that the puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor. When we have a disjunction where one of the parts is negated, we can infer that the other part must be true. This is a form of reasoning known as disjunctive syllogism. Therefore, if the puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor, it must be in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
