            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a logical disjunction (or) and a negation. The first statement, \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge,\" can be represented as P or Q, where P is \"the milk is on the counter\" and Q is \"the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\" The second statement, \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge,\" is the negation of Q, represented as not Q.\n\nIn logic, if we have a disjunction (P or Q) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false (not Q), then we can infer that the other disjunct must be true (P). This is known as the disjunctive syllogism.\n\nTherefore, if \"the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" is false, then \"the milk is on the counter\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
