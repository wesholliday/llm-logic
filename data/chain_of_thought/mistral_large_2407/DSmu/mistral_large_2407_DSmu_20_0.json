            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a logical disjunction (or) and a negation. The first statement, \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head,\" can be represented as P or Q, where P is \"the sunglasses are in her bag\" and Q is \"the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\" The second statement, \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head,\" is a negation of Q, represented as not Q.\n\nIn logic, if we have a disjunction (P or Q) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false (not Q), then we can infer that the other disjunct must be true (P). This is known as the disjunctive syllogism.\n\nTherefore, if \"the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" is not the case, then the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
