            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal,\" which can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal.\"\n\nThe conclusion is also a conditional statement: \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal,\" which can be represented as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, and it is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, the conclusion given is \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ, which is not the contrapositive of the premise. Instead, it is the inverse of the premise, and the inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise, making the argument logically invalid.\n\nAnswer: no"
