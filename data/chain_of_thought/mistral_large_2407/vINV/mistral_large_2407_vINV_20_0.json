            "content": "Explanation: The given argument is a form of logical reasoning known as contraposition. Contraposition is a type of logical equivalence where the premise is a conditional statement (\"If P, then Q\"), and the conclusion is the contrapositive of that statement (\"If not-Q, then not-P\"). In this case, the premise is \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow,\" which can be written as \"If P, then Q.\" The conclusion is \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow,\" which can be written as \"If not-P, then not-Q.\" This is not the correct form of a contrapositive. The correct contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" would be \"If not-Q, then not-P.\" Therefore, the given argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no"
