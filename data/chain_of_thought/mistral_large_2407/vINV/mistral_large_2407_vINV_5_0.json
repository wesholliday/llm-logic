            "content": "Explanation: The given argument is a form of logical reasoning that can be analyzed using contraposition. The original statement is \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis,\" which can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\" The conclusion is \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis,\" which can be written as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ.\n\nIn logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. The contrapositive of P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP. However, the conclusion given is \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ, which is not the contrapositive of the original statement but rather its inverse. The inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid because the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
