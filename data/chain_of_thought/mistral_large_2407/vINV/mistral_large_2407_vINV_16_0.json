            "content": "Explanation: The given argument is a form of logical reasoning that can be analyzed using contraposition. The original statement is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim,\" which can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton,\" which is logically equivalent to the original statement. The conclusion of the argument is \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim,\" which is the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid because the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
