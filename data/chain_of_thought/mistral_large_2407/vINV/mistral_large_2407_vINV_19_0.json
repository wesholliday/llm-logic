            "content": "Explanation: The given argument is an example of a logical fallacy known as denying the antecedent. The structure of the argument is as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q (If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball)\n2. Not P (Tom did not watch football)\n3. Therefore, not Q (Jen did not watch basketball)\n\nThe fallacy lies in the assumption that because the first part (antecedent) of the conditional statement is false, the second part (consequent) must also be false. However, this is not logically valid. The truth of the consequent is not necessarily dependent on the truth of the antecedent. In other words, just because Tom did not watch football, it does not logically follow that Jen did not watch basketball. Jen could still have watched basketball regardless of whether Tom watched football or not.\n\nAnswer: no"
