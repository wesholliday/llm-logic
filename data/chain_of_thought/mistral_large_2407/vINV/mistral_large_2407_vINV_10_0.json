            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise is a conditional statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside,\" which can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the dog was inside\" and Q is \"the cat was outside.\"\n\nThe conclusion is also a conditional statement: \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside,\" which can be represented as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ.\n\nIn logic, the statement P \u2192 Q is equivalent to its contrapositive \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP. However, the conclusion given is \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ, which is not the contrapositive of the premise. Instead, it is the inverse of the premise. The inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
