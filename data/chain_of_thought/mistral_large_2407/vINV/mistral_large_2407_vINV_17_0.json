            "content": "Explanation: The given argument is a form of logical reasoning known as contraposition. Contraposition is a type of logical equivalence where a statement of the form \"If P, then Q\" is logically equivalent to \"If not-Q, then not-P\". In this case, the premise is \"If Ben ate pasta (P), then Kate ate salad (Q)\". The conclusion is \"If Ben did not eat pasta (not-P), then Kate did not eat salad (not-Q)\", which is the contrapositive of the premise. Since the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
