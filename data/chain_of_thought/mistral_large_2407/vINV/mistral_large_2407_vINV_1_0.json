            "content": "Explanation: The given argument is a form of logical reasoning that can be analyzed using contraposition. The original statement is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" which can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding.\" The conclusion is \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding,\" which can be written as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ.\n\nIn logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. The contrapositive of P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP. However, the conclusion given is \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ, which is not the contrapositive of the original statement but rather a different form known as the inverse. The inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid because the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
