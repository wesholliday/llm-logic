            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue,\" which can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\" The conclusion is also a conditional statement: \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue,\" which can be represented as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, and a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. However, the conclusion given is \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ, which is not the contrapositive of the premise. Instead, it is the inverse of the premise. A statement and its inverse are not logically equivalent. Therefore, the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
