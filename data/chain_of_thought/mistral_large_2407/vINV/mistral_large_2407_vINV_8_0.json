            "content": "Explanation: The given argument is an example of a logical form known as contraposition. Contraposition states that a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is logically equivalent to \"If not Q, then not P\". In this case, the premise is \"If the vampire was awake (P), then the mummy was awake (Q)\". The conclusion is \"If the vampire was not awake (not P), then the mummy was not awake (not Q)\", which is the contrapositive of the premise. Since a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
