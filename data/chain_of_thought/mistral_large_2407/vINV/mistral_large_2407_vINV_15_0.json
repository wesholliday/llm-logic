            "content": "Explanation: The given argument is an example of a logical form known as contraposition. Contraposition states that a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is logically equivalent to \"If not-Q, then not-P\". In this case, the premise is \"If Sam took a plane (P), then Erin took a train (Q)\". The conclusion is \"If Sam did not take a plane (not-P), then Erin did not take a train (not-Q)\", which is the contrapositive of the premise. Since a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
