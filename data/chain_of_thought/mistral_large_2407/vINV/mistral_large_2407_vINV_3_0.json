            "content": "Explanation: The given argument is an example of a logical fallacy known as \"denying the antecedent.\" The original statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" does not provide any information about what kind of book it is if James did not write it. The conclusion \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel\" does not necessarily follow from the premise. Just because James writes mystery novels does not mean that no one else does. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
