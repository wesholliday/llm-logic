            "content": "Explanation: The given argument is a form of logical reasoning that can be analyzed using the structure of a conditional statement. The premise is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt,\" which can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThe conclusion is also a conditional statement: \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt,\" which can be represented as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ, where \u00acP is \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" and \u00acQ is \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\n\nIn logic, the statement P \u2192 Q is equivalent to its contrapositive, which is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP. However, the conclusion given is \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ, which is not the contrapositive of the premise but rather the inverse. The inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
