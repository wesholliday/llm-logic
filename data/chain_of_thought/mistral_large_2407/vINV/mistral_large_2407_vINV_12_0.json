            "content": "Explanation: The given argument is a form of logical reasoning that can be analyzed using the structure of material implication in propositional logic. The premise is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo,\" which can be written as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nThe conclusion is \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo,\" which can be written as \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nIn logic, the statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is equivalent to its contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). However, the conclusion given is \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), which is not the contrapositive of the premise but rather the inverse. The inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no"
