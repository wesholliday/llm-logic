The use of the word \"or\" in this context typically indicates that each of the listed options is a separate possibility. Therefore, if the frozz might be \"quork a flonk\" or it might be \"zibble,\" then it is indeed possible to infer that \"The frozz might be zibble\" as one of the standalone possibilities mentioned.\n\nAnswer: yes"
