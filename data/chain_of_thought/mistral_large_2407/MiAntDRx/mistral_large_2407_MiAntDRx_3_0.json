            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The fribble might be in the blurble or on the wumble\" presents two possible locations for the fribble, using the logical disjunction \"or.\" This disjunction implies that at least one of the conditions could be true. Therefore, if the fribble is not in the blurble, it might still be on the wumble. Hence, we can indeed infer \"The fribble might be on the wumble\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
