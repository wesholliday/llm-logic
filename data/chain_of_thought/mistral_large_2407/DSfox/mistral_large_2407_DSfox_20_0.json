The second statement is \"Either the fleeg is surned or it is bluttered.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- Since we know from the first statement that \"The fleeg is not surned,\" the only way for the second statement to be true is if \"The fleeg is bluttered.\"\n- This is because the disjunction in the second statement requires that at least one of the conditions is true, and we already know that \"The fleeg is not surned\" is false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The fleeg is bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
