'Either the flob is movated or it is skizzled'\n\nThe second statement is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true. If 'the flob is movated' were true, then the second statement would be satisfied. However, we know from the first statement that 'the flob is not movated'. Therefore, to satisfy the second statement, the other condition must be true, which is 'the flob is skizzled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
