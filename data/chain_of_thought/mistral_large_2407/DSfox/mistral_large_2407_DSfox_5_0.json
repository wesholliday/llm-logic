We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The zinger is not smoogled.\"\n2. \"Either the zinger is smoogled or it is fraggled.\"\n\nThe second statement is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true. If \"the zinger is smoogled\" were true, then the second statement would be satisfied. However, we know from the first statement that \"the zinger is not smoogled.\" Therefore, for the second statement to still be true, the only remaining option is that \"the zinger is fraggled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
