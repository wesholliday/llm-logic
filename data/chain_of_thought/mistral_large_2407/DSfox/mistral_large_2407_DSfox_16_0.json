The second statement is \"Either the sneg is sproted or it is crampled.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n- Since we know from the first statement that \"The sneg is not sproted,\" the possibility of the sneg being sproted is ruled out.\n- Given the second statement, if the sneg is not sproted, then the only remaining option for the disjunction to be true is that \"The sneg is crampled.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that \"The sneg is crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
