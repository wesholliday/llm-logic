We are also given that \"Either the grommet is plopped or it is sploffed.\" In logical terms, this is a disjunction: P or S, where P is \"the grommet is plopped\" and S is \"the grommet is sploffed.\"\n3. Since we know that P is false (the grommet is not plopped), for the disjunction P or S to be true, S must be true.\n4. Therefore, if the grommet is not plopped, it must be sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
