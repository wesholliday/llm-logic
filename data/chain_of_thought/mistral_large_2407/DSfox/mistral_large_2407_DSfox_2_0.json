We have the statement \"The wug is not bimmed,\" which we can denote as ~B (where B stands for \"the wug is bimmed\").\n2. We also have the statement \"Either the wug is bimmed or it is flooped,\" which can be written as B \u2228 F (where F stands for \"the wug is flooped\").\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \"The wug is flooped\" (F) from these statements.\n\nAccording to the disjunction syllogism in logic, if we have ~B and B \u2228 F, we can indeed conclude F. This is because if the wug is not bimmed (~B), then the only remaining option from the second statement (B \u2228 F) is that the wug must be flooped (F).\n\nAnswer: yes"
