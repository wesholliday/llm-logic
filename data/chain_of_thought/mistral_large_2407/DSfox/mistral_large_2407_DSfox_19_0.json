We are also given that \"Either the smonk is plagged or it is vreebled.\" This can be written in logical terms as \"Plagged OR Vreebled.\"\n3. Since we know that the smonk is not plagged, the only way for the second statement to be true is if the smonk is vreebled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that \"The smonk is vreebled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
