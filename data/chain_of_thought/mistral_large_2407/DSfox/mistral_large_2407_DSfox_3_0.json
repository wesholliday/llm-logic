We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The splat is not quanked.\"\n2. \"Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed.\"\n\nThe second statement is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true. Since the first statement tells us that \"the splat is not quanked,\" the only way for the second statement to be true is if \"the splat is morphed.\" Therefore, we can logically infer that \"the splat is morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
