We are given two statements:\n   - 'The flugel is not zargled.'\n   - 'Either the flugel is zargled or it is blimmed.'\n\n2. The second statement is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true.\n\n3. Since we know from the first statement that 'The flugel is not zargled', the only way for the second statement to be true is if 'The flugel is blimmed'.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the information given, we can infer that 'The flugel is blimmed'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
