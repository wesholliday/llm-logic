'Either the wug is garpled or it is sproinged.'\n\nThe second statement is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the conditions must be true. Since the first statement tells us that 'The wug is not garpled,' the only option left for the second statement to be true is that 'The wug is sproinged.' This is an example of disjunctive syllogism, where from the premises 'not P' and 'P or Q,' we can infer 'Q.'\n\nAnswer: yes."
