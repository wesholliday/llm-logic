We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The fribble is not crinked.\"\n2. \"Either the fribble is crinked or it is snurgled.\"\n\nThe second statement is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the conditions must be true. If \"the fribble is crinked\" were true, then the second statement would be satisfied. However, we know from the first statement that \"the fribble is not crinked.\" Therefore, to satisfy the second statement, the other condition must be true, which is \"the fribble is snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
