We are also given that \"Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked.\"\n\nIn logic, the statement \"Either A or B\" means that if A is false, then B must be true.\n\nSince we know that \"The sprocket is not daggled\" (meaning the statement \"The sprocket is daggled\" is false), according to the second statement, \"The sprocket is cranked\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
