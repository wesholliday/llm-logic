The second statement is \"Either the flug is zimmed or it is blummed.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- Since the first statement asserts that \"The flug is not zimmed,\" the only way the second statement can be true is if \"The flug is blummed.\" This is because the disjunction requires at least one of the conditions to be true, and we already know that \"The flug is zimmed\" is false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The flug is blummed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
