The second statement is \"Either the twonk is plinked or it is varnished.\" This can be written in logical terms as \"If not plinked, then varnished.\"\n3. Since we know from the first statement that the twonk is not plinked, we can apply this to the second statement.\n4. Therefore, according to the second statement, if the twonk is not plinked, it must be varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes"
