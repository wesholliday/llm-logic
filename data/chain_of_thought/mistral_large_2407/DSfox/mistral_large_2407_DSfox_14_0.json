We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The clug is not snugged.\"\n2. \"Either the clug is snugged or it is fleeked.\"\n\nThe second statement is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true. If \"the clug is snugged\" were true, then the second statement would be satisfied. However, we know from the first statement that \"the clug is not snugged.\" Therefore, for the second statement to still be true, the other condition must hold, which is \"the clug is fleeked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes."
