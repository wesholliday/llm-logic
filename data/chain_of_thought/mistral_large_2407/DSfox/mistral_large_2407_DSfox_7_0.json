The first statement is \"The whiffle is not tinked.\" This is a straightforward assertion that the whiffle does not have the property of being tinked.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the whiffle is tinked or it is shanked.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the whiffle is tinked, or the whiffle is shanked.\n\nGiven that the first statement asserts that the whiffle is not tinked, we can eliminate the possibility that the whiffle is tinked from the second statement. Therefore, the only remaining option from the disjunction is that the whiffle must be shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
