However, we cannot infer from this statement alone that 'The exam must have been difficult' because it does not provide any evidence or certainty that the exam was indeed difficult. The use of 'or' indicates that at least one of the conditions is true, but it does not specify which one. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the exam was definitely difficult based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
