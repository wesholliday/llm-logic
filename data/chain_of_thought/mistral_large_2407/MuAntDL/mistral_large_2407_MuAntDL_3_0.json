            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The keys must have been in the drawer or on the table\" presents two possible locations for the keys. The use of \"or\" in this context implies that either one or the other could be true, or possibly both. However, it does not definitively confirm that the keys must have been in the drawer. To infer that the keys must have been in the drawer, we would need additional information that excludes the possibility of them being on the table. Without such information, we cannot make a definitive inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
