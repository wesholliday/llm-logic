            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday or extended\" presents two possibilities: either the project was completed by Friday, or it was extended. The use of \"or\" in this context does not exclude the possibility that the project was extended, which means we cannot definitively conclude that the project must have been completed by Friday. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The project must have been completed by Friday\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
