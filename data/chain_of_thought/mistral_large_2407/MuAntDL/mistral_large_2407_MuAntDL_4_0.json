When we consider logical inference, we cannot definitively conclude that the meeting was at 2 PM just from this statement alone, because the second possibility (that it was cancelled) also exists. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
