            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The restaurant might be closed on Mondays or open for limited hours\" presents two possibilities: one is that the restaurant might be closed on Mondays, and the other is that it might be open for limited hours on Mondays. The use of the word \"or\" in this context does not exclude either possibility. Therefore, from the given statement, it is valid to infer that \"The restaurant might be closed on Mondays\" because it is one of the two possibilities mentioned.\n\nAnswer: yes"
