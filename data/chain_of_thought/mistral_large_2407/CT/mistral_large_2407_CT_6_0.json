            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is an example of a conditional statement in logic, which can be written as \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q is \"Bob chose pasta.\" The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P\" or \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\" In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if the statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is true, then we can indeed infer that \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
