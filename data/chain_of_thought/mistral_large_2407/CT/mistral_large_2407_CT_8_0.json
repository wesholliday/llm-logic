            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is an example of a conditional statement in logic, which can be written as \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"the vampire was awake\" and Q is \"the mummy was awake.\" The question asks if we can infer the inverse of this statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P.\" In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true. However, in this case, the inverse also happens to be true because the relationship between the vampire and the mummy being awake is presented as a direct dependency. If the mummy was not awake, then the condition for the vampire being awake is not met, so the vampire was also not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes"
