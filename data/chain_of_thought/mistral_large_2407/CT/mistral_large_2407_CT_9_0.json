            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" The question asks if we can infer the statement \"If not Q, then not P,\" which is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are always logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true, then \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
