            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is an example of a conditional statement in logic, which can be written in the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel.\" The question asks whether we can infer the statement \"If not Q, then not P,\" which is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are always logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is true, then \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
