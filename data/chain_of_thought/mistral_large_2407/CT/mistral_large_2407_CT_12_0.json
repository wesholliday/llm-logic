            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" The question asks if we can infer the statement \"If not Q, then not P,\" which is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is true, then \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
