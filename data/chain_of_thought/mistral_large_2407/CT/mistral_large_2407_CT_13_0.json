            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is an example of an implication in logic, which can be written as \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\" The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of this implication, which is \"If not Q, then not P\" or \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\" In logic, an implication and its contrapositive are always logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, we can indeed infer \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
