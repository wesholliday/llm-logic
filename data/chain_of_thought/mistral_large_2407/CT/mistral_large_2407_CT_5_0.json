            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is an example of a conditional statement in logic, which is of the form \"If P, then Q\". The statement is \"If Jeff played basketball (P), then Amy played tennis (Q)\". The question asks if we can infer the statement \"If Amy did not play tennis (not Q), then Jeff did not play basketball (not P)\". This is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning if one is true, the other must also be true. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
