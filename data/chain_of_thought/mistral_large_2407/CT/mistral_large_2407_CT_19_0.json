            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is an example of a conditional statement in logic, which can be written as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball.\" The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P,\" or \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\" In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, if the statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is true, then we can indeed infer that \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
