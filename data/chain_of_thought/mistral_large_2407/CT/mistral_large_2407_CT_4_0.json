            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is an example of a conditional statement in logic, which is of the form \"If P, then Q\". The question asks whether we can infer the statement \"If not Q, then not P\" from the given statement. In logic, this is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. A statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" is true, then \"If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
