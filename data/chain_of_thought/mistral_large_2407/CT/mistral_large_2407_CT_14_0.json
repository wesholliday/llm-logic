            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the bear was in the cave\" and Q is \"the wolf was in the den.\" The question asks if we can infer the statement \"If not-Q, then not-P,\" which is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" is true, then \"If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
