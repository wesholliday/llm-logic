            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is an example of a conditional statement in logic, which can be written in the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins were blueberry\". The question asks whether we can infer the statement \"If not Q, then not P\", which is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are always logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is true, then \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
