            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"Sam took a plane\" and Q is \"Erin took a train\". The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P\", or \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane\". In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if one is true, the other must also be true. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the inferred statement must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
