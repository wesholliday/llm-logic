            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the griffin was in the forest\" and Q is \"the unicorn was in the forest\". The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P\". In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if one is true, the other must also be true. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the inference \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
