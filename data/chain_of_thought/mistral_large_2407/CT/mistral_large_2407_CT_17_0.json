            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is an example of a conditional statement in logic, which can be written as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q is \"Kate ate the salad\". The question asks if we can infer the statement \"If not Q, then not P\", which is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\" is true, then \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
