            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the dog was inside\" and Q is \"the cat was outside.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside.\" This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nThe contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" Therefore, the contrapositive of \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" is indeed \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
