            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow.\" The question asks whether we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P,\" or \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\" In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, if the statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is true, then the statement \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
