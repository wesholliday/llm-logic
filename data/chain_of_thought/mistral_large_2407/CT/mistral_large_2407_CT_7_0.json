            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is an example of a conditional statement in logic, which can be written as \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"Alex finished the race\" and Q is \"Chris finished the race.\" The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" In this case, that translates to \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\" Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed make this inference.\n\nAnswer: yes"
