            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is an example of a conditional statement in logic, which can be written as \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim.\" The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P\" or \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\" In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if one is true, the other must also be true. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the inferred statement must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
