            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is an example of a conditional statement in logic, which can be written as \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding.\" The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P\" or \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\" In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, if the statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is true, we can indeed infer that \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
