The disjunction states that either the whiffle is shanked (P) or it must be tinked (Q). The negation states that it's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked (not Q). In logic, if we have \"P or Q\" and \"not Q\", then we can infer \"P\". This is because if \"Q\" is false, then for \"P or Q\" to be true, \"P\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
