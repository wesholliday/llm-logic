The first statement, \"Either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged,\" can be represented as P \u2228 Q, where P is \"the smonk is vreebled\" and Q is \"the smonk must be plagged.\" The second statement, \"It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged,\" is the negation of Q, represented as \u00acQ.\n\nIn logic, if we have P \u2228 Q and \u00acQ, we can infer P. This is because if Q is false, then for the disjunction P \u2228 Q to be true, P must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
