According to the rules of logic, if we have \"P or Q\" and \"Not Q\", then we can infer \"P\". In this case, \"P\" is \"The glip is slogged\" and \"Q\" is \"It must be tragged\". Since we are given \"It's not the case that the glip must be tragged\" (Not Q), we can infer \"The glip is slogged\" (P).\n\nAnswer: yes"
