According to the rules of logic, specifically the disjunctive syllogism, if we have \"P or Q\" and \"not Q\", then we can infer \"P\". In this case, \"P\" is \"The sneg is crampled\" and \"Q\" is \"it must be sproted\". Since we are given \"It's not the case that the sneg must be sproted\" (not Q), we can infer \"The sneg is crampled\" (P).\n\nAnswer: yes"
