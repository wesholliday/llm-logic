The second statement, 'The pen isn't on my desk', eliminates one of those possibilities. According to the logical disjunction presented in the first statement, if one of the options is false, then the other must be true. Therefore, if the pen is not on the desk, it must be in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
