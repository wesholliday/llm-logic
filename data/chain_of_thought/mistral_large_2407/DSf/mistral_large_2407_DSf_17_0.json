            "content": "Explanation: The given statements form a logical disjunction (or) and a negation. The first statement, \"Either the scarf is draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack,\" presents two possibilities. The second statement, \"The scarf isn't draped on the coat rack,\" eliminates one of those possibilities. According to the principle of disjunctive syllogism in logic, if one of the possibilities in a disjunction is false, then the other must be true. Therefore, if the scarf is not on the coat rack, it must be in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes"
