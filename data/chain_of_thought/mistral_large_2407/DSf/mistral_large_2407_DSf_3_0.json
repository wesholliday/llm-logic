            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a logical disjunction (or) and a negation. The first statement, \"Either the keys are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer,\" implies that one of these two conditions must be true. The second statement, \"The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet,\" negates the first condition. Therefore, if the first condition is false, the second condition must be true, as one of them has to be true according to the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
