            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a logical disjunction (or) and a negation. The first statement, \"Either the book is resting on the table or it is on the shelf,\" implies that at least one of these conditions must be true. The second statement, \"The book isn't resting on the table,\" negates one of these conditions. Therefore, if the book is not on the table, the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that the book must be on the shelf. This is an example of the logical process known as disjunctive syllogism.\n\nAnswer: yes"
