            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a logical disjunction (or) and a negation. The first statement, \"Either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside,\" means that at least one of these two conditions is true. The second statement, \"Fido is not in the garden,\" negates one of these conditions. If Fido is not in the garden, then the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that Fido is inside. This is an application of the logical principle known as disjunctive syllogism.\n\nAnswer: yes"
