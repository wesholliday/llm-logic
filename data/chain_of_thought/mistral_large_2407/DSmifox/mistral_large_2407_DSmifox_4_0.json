It doesn't provide certainty, just possibility.\n2. \"Either the fribble must be crinked or it is snurgled\" presents two options: either the fribble is definitely crinked, or it is snurgled.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- If the fribble might not be crinked (from the first statement), then according to the second statement, the only remaining option is that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
