It doesn't confirm whether the flugel is zargled or not.\n2. \"Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed\" presents two possibilities: the flugel is zargled, or the flugel is blimmed.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- If the flugel is not zargled (which is possible according to the first statement), then according to the second statement, the flugel must be blimmed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The flugel is blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
