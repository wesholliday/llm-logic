The first statement is \"The splat might not be quanked.\" This implies that there is a possibility that the splat is not quanked, but it doesn't exclude the possibility that it is quanked.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed.\" This means that if the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- If the splat might not be quanked (from the first statement), then according to the second statement, it must be morphed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
