However, it does not confirm that the smonk is definitely not plagged; it could be either plagged or not plagged.\n\n2. \"Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled\" presents two possibilities: the smonk is either plagged or vreebled.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The smonk is vreebled,\" we need to consider both statements together. Since the first statement does not definitively rule out the smonk being plagged, we cannot conclude that the smonk must be vreebled based on the second statement. The smonk could still be plagged, as the first statement only suggests a possibility, not a certainty.\n\nAnswer: no"
