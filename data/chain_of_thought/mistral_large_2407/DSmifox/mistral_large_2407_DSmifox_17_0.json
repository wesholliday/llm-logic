It doesn't confirm that the flob is not movated, just that it's a possibility.\n\n2. \"Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled\" presents two possibilities: the flob is movated, or the flob is skizzled.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The flob is skizzled,\" we need to consider both statements together. Since the first statement only presents a possibility and doesn't confirm the flob's status, we cannot definitively conclude that the flob is skizzled based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
