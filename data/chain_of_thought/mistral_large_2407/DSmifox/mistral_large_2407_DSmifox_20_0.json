However, it does not confirm that the fleeg is definitely not surned.\n2. \"Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered\" presents two possibilities: the fleeg is surned or it is bluttered.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The fleeg is bluttered,\" we need to consider both statements together. Since the first statement does not exclude the possibility that the fleeg is surned, we cannot definitively conclude that the fleeg is bluttered based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
