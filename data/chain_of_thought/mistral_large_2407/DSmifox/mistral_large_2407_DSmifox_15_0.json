The first statement is \"The dreb might not be spened,\" which means it's possible that the dreb is not spened.\n2. The second statement is \"Either the dreb must be spened or it is vroombed.\" This means that if the dreb is not spened, then it must be vroombed.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- If the dreb might not be spened (from the first statement), then according to the second statement, it must be vroombed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The dreb is vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
