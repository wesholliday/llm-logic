The first statement is \"The glip might not be tragged.\" This implies that there is a possibility that the glip is not tragged, but it doesn't exclude the possibility that it is tragged.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged.\" This means that if the glip is not tragged, then it must be slogged.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. If the glip might not be tragged (as per the first statement), then according to the second statement, it must be slogged.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The glip is slogged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
