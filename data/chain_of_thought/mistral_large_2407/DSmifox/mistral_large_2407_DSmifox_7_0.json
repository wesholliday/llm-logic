However, it does not confirm that the whiffle is definitely not tinked.\n2. \"Either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked\" presents two possibilities: the whiffle is tinked, or the whiffle is shanked.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The whiffle is shanked,\" we need to consider both statements together. Since the first statement does not rule out the possibility of the whiffle being tinked, we cannot definitively conclude that the whiffle is shanked based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
