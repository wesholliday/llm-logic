The first statement is \"The shank might not be nugged.\" This implies that there is a possibility that the shank is not nugged, but it doesn't exclude the possibility that it is nugged.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked.\" This means that if the shank is not nugged, then it must be plooked.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- If the shank is not nugged (which is a possibility according to the first statement), then according to the second statement, it must be plooked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the shank is plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
