The first statement is \"The wug might not be garpled.\" This implies that it is possible for the wug to not be garpled, but it doesn't exclude the possibility that the wug is garpled.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the wug must be garpled or it is sproinged.\" This means that if the wug is not garpled, then it must be sproinged.\n\n3. Combining these two statements, if the wug is not garpled (which is a possibility according to the first statement), then according to the second statement, the wug must be sproinged.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The wug is sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
