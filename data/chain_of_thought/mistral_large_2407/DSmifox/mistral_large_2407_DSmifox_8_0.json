It doesn't confirm whether the sprocket is daggled or not.\n2. \"Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked\" presents two possibilities: the sprocket is either daggled or cranked.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- If the sprocket is not daggled (which is a possibility according to the first statement), then according to the second statement, it must be cranked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
