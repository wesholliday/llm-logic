However, it does not confirm with certainty that the grommet is not plopped.\n2. \"Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed\" presents two possibilities: the grommet is plopped, or the grommet is sploffed.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The grommet is sploffed,\" we need to consider both statements together. Since the first statement does not definitively rule out the possibility that the grommet is plopped, we cannot conclusively infer that the grommet is sploffed based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
