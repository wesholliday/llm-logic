However, it then specifies that the umbrella is not in the closet. Given these two pieces of information, if the umbrella is not in the closet, the only remaining option from the initial statement is that it must be in the car. This is a case of disjunctive syllogism, where if one of two possible situations is false, then the other must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
