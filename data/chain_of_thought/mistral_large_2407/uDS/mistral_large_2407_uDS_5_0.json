It then eliminates one of these possibilities by stating that the cookies aren't hidden in the pantry. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the cookies are in the jar. This is an example of disjunctive syllogism, where if one of two possibilities is false, the other must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
