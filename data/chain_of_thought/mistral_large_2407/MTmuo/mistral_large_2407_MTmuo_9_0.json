            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" can be rephrased as \"Mark did not necessarily buy the blue shirt.\" This means that Mark might or might not have bought the blue shirt.\n\n2. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" establishes a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- If Lisa bought the red shirt, then according to the second statement, Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n- However, the first statement tells us that Mark did not necessarily buy the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, for these two statements to be true simultaneously, Lisa cannot have bought the red shirt. If Lisa had bought the red shirt, it would contradict the first statement because it would necessitate that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes"
