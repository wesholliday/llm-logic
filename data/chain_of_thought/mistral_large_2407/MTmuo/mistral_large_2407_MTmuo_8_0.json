The first statement is \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\" This can be rephrased as \"The mummy might not have been awake.\"\n2. The second statement is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\" This is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between the vampire being awake and the mummy being awake.\n\nNow, let's use these statements to determine if we can infer that \"The vampire was not awake.\"\n\nIf the vampire was awake, according to the second statement, the mummy must have been awake. However, the first statement tells us that the mummy might not have been awake. Therefore, to satisfy both statements, the vampire could not have been awake, because if the vampire were awake, it would contradict the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
