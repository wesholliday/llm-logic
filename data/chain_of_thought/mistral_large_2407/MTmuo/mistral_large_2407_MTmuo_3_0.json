            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\" This can be rephrased as \"The book does not have to be a mystery novel.\"\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional: \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\" This means that if the book was written by James, it necessarily has to be a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. If the book was written by James, then according to the second statement, it must be a mystery novel. However, the first statement tells us that the book does not have to be a mystery novel. Therefore, the book cannot have been written by James, because if it were, it would contradict the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
