We are given that \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\" This means that the pants could have been any other material besides denim.\n2. The second statement is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\" This is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between the shirt being cotton and the pants being denim.\n3. If the shirt was indeed cotton, then according to the second statement, the pants must have been denim. However, we know from the first statement that the pants could not have been necessarily denim.\n4. Therefore, to avoid a contradiction, the shirt could not have been cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes"
