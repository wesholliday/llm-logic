            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step.\n\n1. We are given the statement \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\" This means that the banana could be any color other than yellow.\n2. The second statement is \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" This is a conditional statement that links the color of the apple to the color of the banana.\n3. To determine if we can infer \"The apple was not red,\" we need to consider the contrapositive of the second statement. The contrapositive of \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" is \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\"\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the banana was not necessarily yellow, we can apply the contrapositive and conclude that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes"
