We are given the statement \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\" This means that the truck could be made of any material, not necessarily metal.\n2. The second statement is \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the doll is plastic, then the truck being metal is a necessity.\n3. Now, let's combine these two statements. Since we know that the truck doesn't necessarily have to be metal, the condition where the doll is plastic (which would require the truck to be metal) cannot be true.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes"
