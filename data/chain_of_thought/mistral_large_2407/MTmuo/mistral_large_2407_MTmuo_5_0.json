The statement \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis\" implies that Amy might not have played tennis.\n2. The statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis\" implies that if Jeff played basketball, then it is necessary that Amy played tennis.\n3. If Jeff had played basketball, then according to the second statement, Amy must have played tennis. But this contradicts the first statement which says that it's not certain that Amy played tennis.\n4. Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, we must conclude that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes"
