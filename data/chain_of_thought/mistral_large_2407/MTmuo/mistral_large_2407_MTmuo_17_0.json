We are given the statement \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad.\" This means that Kate might not have eaten salad.\n2. The second statement is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\" This is a conditional statement that implies if Ben ate pasta, then it is a necessity that Kate ate salad.\n3. Now, if Kate might not have eaten salad (from the first statement), then the condition \"Kate must have eaten salad\" cannot be true.\n4. Therefore, the condition \"Ben ate pasta\" which leads to \"Kate must have eaten salad\" also cannot be true.\n5. Hence, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes"
