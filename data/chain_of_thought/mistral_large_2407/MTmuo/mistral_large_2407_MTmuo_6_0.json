In other words, it's not certain that Bob chose pasta.\n\n2. \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\" implies that Sue choosing pizza is a sufficient condition for Bob choosing pasta. If Sue chose pizza, then it would be certain that Bob chose pasta.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. If Sue had chosen pizza, then according to the second statement, Bob must have chosen pasta. However, the first statement tells us that it's not certain that Bob chose pasta. Therefore, Sue cannot have chosen pizza, because if she had, it would contradict the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
