We have the statement \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This means that Sue might not have been at the wedding.\n2. The second statement is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This means that Mary being at the wedding is a sufficient condition for Sue being at the wedding.\n3. If Mary had been at the wedding, according to the second statement, Sue would have had to be at the wedding. But according to the first statement, Sue might not have been at the wedding.\n4. Therefore, to satisfy both statements, we must conclude that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes"
