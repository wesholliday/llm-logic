The first statement is \"It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter.\" This can be rephrased as \"The robot did not necessarily visit Jupiter.\"\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\" This means that if the alien visited Mars, it is a necessity that the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. If the alien had visited Mars, according to the second statement, the robot must have visited Jupiter. However, the first statement tells us that the robot did not necessarily visit Jupiter. Therefore, the only way both statements can be true is if the alien did not visit Mars, because if the alien had visited Mars, it would contradict the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
