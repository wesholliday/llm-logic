We have two statements:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\" This means that Erin might or might not have taken a train, but it's not a necessity.\n2. \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\" This is a conditional statement that ties Sam's action to Erin's.\n\nIf Sam had taken a plane, then according to the second statement, Erin must have taken a train. However, we know from the first statement that this is not the case. Therefore, the only way to avoid a contradiction is if Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes"
