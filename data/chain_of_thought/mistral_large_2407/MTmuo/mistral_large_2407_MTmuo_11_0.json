The first statement is \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\" This means that the muffins could be any flavor other than blueberry, or we simply don't know their flavor.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\" This means that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are definitely blueberry.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. If the cake were chocolate, then according to the second statement, the muffins must have been blueberry. However, the first statement tells us that the muffins must not have been blueberry. Therefore, to satisfy both statements, the cake cannot be chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes"
