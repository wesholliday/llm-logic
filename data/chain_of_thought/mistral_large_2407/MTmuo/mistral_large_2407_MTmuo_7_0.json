We are given that \"It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race.\" This means that Chris possibly did not finish the race.\n2. We are also given that \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\" This means that if Alex finished the race, then it is a necessity that Chris also finished the race.\n3. Now, let's combine these two statements. If Alex had finished the race, then it would be a necessity that Chris finished the race. But we know that it's not the case that Chris must have finished the race. Therefore, Alex could not have finished the race, because if he had, it would make it a necessity that Chris finished the race, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
