            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step.\n\n1. We are given that \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\" This means Jen may or may not have watched basketball, but there's no obligation or certainty that she did.\n\n2. The second statement is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement, meaning that if Tom watched football, then it is a necessity that Jen watched basketball.\n\n3. Now, let's combine these two statements. If Jen did not necessarily watch basketball (from the first statement), then the condition for Tom watching football (which would necessitate Jen watching basketball) cannot be met.\n\n4. Therefore, since the condition that Jen must have watched basketball is not met, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes"
