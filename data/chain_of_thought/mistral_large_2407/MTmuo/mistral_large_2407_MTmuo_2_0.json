We have the statement \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" This can be written as ~N, where N is \"the unicorn must have been in the forest.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" This can be written as G -> N, where G is \"the griffin was in the forest.\"\n\n3. We want to find out if we can infer \"The griffin was not in the forest\" (~G).\n\n4. According to the principle of modus tollens, if we have ~N and G -> N, then we can indeed infer ~G.\n\nAnswer: yes"
