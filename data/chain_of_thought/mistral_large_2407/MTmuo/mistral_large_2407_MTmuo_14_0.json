The first statement is \"It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den.\" This can be rephrased as \"The wolf might not have been in the den.\"\n2. The second statement is a conditional: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\" This means that if the bear was in the cave, it is necessary that the wolf was in the den.\n3. Now, let's combine these two statements. If the wolf might not have been in the den, then the condition for the bear being in the cave is not met (because the bear being in the cave requires the wolf to definitely be in the den).\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes"
