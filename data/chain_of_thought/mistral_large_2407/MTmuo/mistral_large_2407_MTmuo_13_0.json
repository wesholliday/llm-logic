The first statement is \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\" This means that the truck could be any color other than blue, or we simply don't have enough information to conclude that it's blue.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional: \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\" This means that if the car is red, then the truck being blue is a necessity.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. If the car were red, then according to the second statement, the truck must have been blue. However, the first statement tells us that the truck could not have been necessarily blue. Therefore, to avoid a contradiction, we must conclude that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes"
