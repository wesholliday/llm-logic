We are given that \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" This means that Lucy might or might not have gone to the zoo, but it's not a necessity.\n\n2. The second statement is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" This is a conditional statement that ties Joe going to the park with Lucy necessarily going to the zoo.\n\n3. If Joe had gone to the park, according to the second statement, it would be a necessity that Lucy went to the zoo. But this contradicts the first statement, which says that it's not a necessity that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\n4. Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, we must conclude that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes"
