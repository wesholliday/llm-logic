            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document must have been signed and notarized\" implies that two actions are required: signing and notarizing. If the document must have been signed and notarized, then it logically follows that it must have been notarized, as notarizing is one of the two required actions. The use of the conjunction \"and\" indicates that both conditions need to be met, but stating one of them as a necessity is a logical consequence of the combined requirement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
