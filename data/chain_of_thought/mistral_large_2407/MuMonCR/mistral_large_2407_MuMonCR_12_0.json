            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday and under budget\" is a compound statement combining two conditions: completion by Friday and being under budget. The use of the conjunction \"and\" implies that both conditions must be true. Therefore, if the entire statement is true, then each individual condition must also be true. This means that if the project must have been completed by Friday and under budget, it necessarily follows that the project must have been under budget.\n\nAnswer: yes"
