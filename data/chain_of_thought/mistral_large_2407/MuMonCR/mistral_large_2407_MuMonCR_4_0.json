            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM and in the conference room\" is a compound statement combining two pieces of information: the time of the meeting (2 PM) and the location of the meeting (the conference room). When we consider the logical structure of this statement, it's clear that if the entire statement is true, then each individual part must also be true. Therefore, if the meeting must have been at 2 PM and in the conference room, it logically follows that the meeting must have been in the conference room, regardless of the time.\n\nAnswer: yes"
