            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The envelope must have been upstairs and under a bed\" combines two conditions: being upstairs and being under a bed. If the envelope must satisfy both conditions, then it logically follows that it must satisfy each one individually. Therefore, if the envelope must have been upstairs and under a bed, it must have been under a bed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
