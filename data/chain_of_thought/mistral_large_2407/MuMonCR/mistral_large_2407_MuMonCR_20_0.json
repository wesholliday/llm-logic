            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The event must have been formal and required tickets\" is a compound statement combining two conditions: the event was formal, and the event required tickets. When we consider the second part, \"required tickets,\" it is a standalone requirement that does not depend on the event being formal. Therefore, if the original statement is true, it logically follows that the event must have required tickets, regardless of its formality.\n\nAnswer: yes"
