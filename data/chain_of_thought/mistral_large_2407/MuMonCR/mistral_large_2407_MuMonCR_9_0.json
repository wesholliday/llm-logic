            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The flight must have been delayed and rerouted\" combines two events: the flight being delayed and the flight being rerouted. The use of the word \"and\" suggests that both events occurred. Therefore, if the entire statement is true, then each individual part must also be true. This means that if the flight was delayed and rerouted, it necessarily follows that the flight was rerouted.\n\nAnswer: yes"
