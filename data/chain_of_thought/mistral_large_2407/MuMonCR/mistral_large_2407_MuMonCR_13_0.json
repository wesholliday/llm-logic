            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The movie must have been in English and had subtitles\" combines two conditions: the movie being in English and the movie having subtitles. The use of the word \"and\" indicates that both conditions are true. Therefore, if the entire statement is true, then each individual part must also be true. This means that if the movie must have been in English and had subtitles, it logically follows that the movie must have had subtitles.\n\nAnswer: yes"
