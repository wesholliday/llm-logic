When we consider the statement \"The package might be delayed or delivered,\" this includes the possibility of the package being delivered, as well as the additional possibility of it being delayed. Since the original statement already allows for the possibility of delivery, it is logically consistent with the second statement, which simply adds another possible outcome.\n\nAnswer: yes"
