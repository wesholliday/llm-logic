            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The envelope might be under a bed\" presents one possible location for the envelope. When we consider the statement \"The envelope might be upstairs or under a bed,\" it includes the original possibility (under a bed) and adds another possibility (upstairs). Since the original statement does not exclude the envelope being upstairs, expanding the possibilities to include \"upstairs\" is a logical extension. Therefore, the inference is valid because it includes the original possibility along with an additional one.\n\nAnswer: yes"
