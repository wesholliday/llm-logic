When we say \"The weather might be rainy or sunny,\" we are acknowledging that there are at least two possibilities: rainy or sunny. Since the original statement does not exclude the possibility of rainy weather, it is logically consistent to infer that \"The weather might be rainy or sunny.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
