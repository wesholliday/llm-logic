When we consider the phrase \"might be,\" it implies uncertainty, meaning there are other possibilities as well. One of those possibilities is that the movie might not be interesting, which includes the possibility that it could be boring. Therefore, the statement \"The movie might be interesting\" does allow for the inference that \"The movie might be boring or interesting.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
