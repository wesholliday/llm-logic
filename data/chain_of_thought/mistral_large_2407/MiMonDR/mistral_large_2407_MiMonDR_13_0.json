However, it does not provide any information about whether the meeting is currently scheduled or not. The phrase \"might be cancelled\" only refers to the potential for cancellation, not the current status of the meeting. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The meeting might be scheduled or cancelled\" because the original statement does not give us enough information about the meeting's current scheduling status.\n\nAnswer: no"
