It does not definitively state that the restaurant is closed, but rather that there is a possibility of it being closed. This uncertainty inherently includes the possibility that the restaurant might also be open. Therefore, the statement \"The restaurant might be open or closed\" is a broader statement that encompasses the original statement's uncertainty.\n\nAnswer: yes"
