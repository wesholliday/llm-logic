However, it does not exclude the possibility of the project failing. In other words, it leaves open the chance for either success or failure. Therefore, from \"The project might be successful,\" we can indeed infer that \"The project might fail or be successful\" because the original statement does not guarantee success and allows for the possibility of failure.\n\nAnswer: yes"
