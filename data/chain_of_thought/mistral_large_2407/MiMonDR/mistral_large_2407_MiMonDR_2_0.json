When we consider the statement \"The book might be in the drawer or on the shelf,\" it expands the possibilities to include both the shelf and the drawer. Since the original statement does not exclude the possibility that the book could also be in the drawer, it is logically consistent to infer the second statement from the first. The second statement simply adds another possible location without contradicting the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
