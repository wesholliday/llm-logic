            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The team might win the game\" implies that there is a possibility of the team winning. However, it does not exclude the possibility of other outcomes, such as losing. When we say \"The team might win the game,\" it inherently includes the uncertainty of the outcome, which means the team could also lose. Therefore, the statement \"The team might lose or win the game\" is a broader statement that encompasses the original statement's uncertainty.\n\nAnswer: yes"
