            "content": "Explanation: The sentence \"The quibble might be frazzled and gronked\" is a compound predicate joined by the conjunction \"and.\" This means that two actions, \"frazzled\" and \"gronked,\" are both being applied to the subject, \"the quibble.\" In logic, if a statement says that both A and B are true, then each part (A or B) must also be true individually. Therefore, if \"the quibble might be frazzled and gronked\" is true, then it must also be true that \"the quibble might be gronked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
