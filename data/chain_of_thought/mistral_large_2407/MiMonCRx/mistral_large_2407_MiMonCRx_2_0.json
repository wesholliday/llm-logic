            "content": "Explanation: The sentence \"The quibble might be snorked and wumbled\" is a compound predicate joined by the conjunction \"and.\" In such structures, each predicate can stand alone as a possibility for the subject. Therefore, if the quibble might be both snorked and wumbled, it logically follows that it might be wumbled. The phrase \"and wumbled\" adds an additional possibility but does not negate the independent possibility of the quibble being wumbled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
