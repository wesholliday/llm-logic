            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is an example of a conditional statement in logic, which can be written in the form \"If P, then Q.\" The statement given is \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated.\" In logical terms, this is P implies Q (P \u2192 Q).\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If the flob was not skizzled, then the flob was not movated.\" This is the contrapositive of the original statement, which is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis (P) and the conclusion (Q) and then switching their places. So, the contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nSince the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
