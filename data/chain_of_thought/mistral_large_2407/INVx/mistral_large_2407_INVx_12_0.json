            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the smip was shripped\" and Q is \"the smip lupped the zoint.\" The question asks if we can infer the statement \"If not P, then not Q,\" which is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint\" is true, then \"If the smip was not shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
