            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is an example of a conditional statement in logic, which follows the form \"If P, then Q.\" The question asks whether we can infer the contrapositive of the statement. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning if one is true, the other must also be true. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" However, the question asks about a different form, \"If not P, then not Q,\" which is known as the inverse of the original statement. The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the inverse from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
