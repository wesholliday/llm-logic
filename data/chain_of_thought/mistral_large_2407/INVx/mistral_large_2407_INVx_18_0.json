            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the shank was plooked\" and Q is \"the shank was nugged.\" The question asks if we can infer the statement \"If not P, then not Q,\" which is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\" is true, then \"If the shank was not plooked, then the shank was not nugged\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
