            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and Q is \"the dreb was spened.\" The question asks if we can infer the statement \"If not P, then not Q,\" which is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\" is true, then \"If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
