            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the fribble was snurgled\" and Q is \"the fribble crinked.\" The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P,\" or in this case, \"If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled.\" In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if one is true, the other must also be true. Therefore, we can indeed infer \"If the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
