            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the glip was slogged\" and Q is \"the glip was tragged.\" The question asks if we can infer the statement \"If not P, then not Q,\" which is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\" is true, then \"If the glip was not slogged, then the glip was not tragged\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
