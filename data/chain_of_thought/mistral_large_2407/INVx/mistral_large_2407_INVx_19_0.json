            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q.\" The question asks if we can infer \"If the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk was not plagged,\" which is of the form \"If not P, then not Q.\" This is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are always logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, if \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged\" is true, then \"If the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk was not plagged\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
