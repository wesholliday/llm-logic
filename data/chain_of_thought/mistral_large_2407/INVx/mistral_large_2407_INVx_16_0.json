            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the sneg was crampled\" and Q is \"the sneg sproted the frink.\" The question asks whether we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P,\" or in this case, \"If the sneg did not sprot the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\" However, the question presents the negation of the original antecedent (P) and asks about the negation of the consequent (Q), which is not a valid logical inference from the original statement. The original statement does not provide information about what happens when the sneg is not crampled; it only tells us what happens when it is crampled. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the statement \"If the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
