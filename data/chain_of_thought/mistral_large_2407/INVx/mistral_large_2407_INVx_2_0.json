            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the wug was flooped\" and Q is \"the wug bimmed the zoint.\" The question asks if we can infer the statement \"If not P, then not Q,\" which is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint\" is true, then \"If the wug was not flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
