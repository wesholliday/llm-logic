            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a logical disjunction and a negation. The first statement, \"Either the shank is plooked or it is nugged,\" can be represented as P \u2228 N, where P is \"the shank is plooked\" and N is \"the shank is nugged.\" The second statement, \"The shank is not nugged,\" is represented as \u00acN.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The shank is plooked,\" we can use the disjunctive syllogism rule. This rule states that if we have a disjunction (P \u2228 N) and the negation of one of the disjuncts (\u00acN), we can infer the other disjunct (P).\n\nIn this case, since we have P \u2228 N and \u00acN, we can validly infer P, which is \"The shank is plooked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
