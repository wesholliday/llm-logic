            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a disjunction (either/or) and a negation. The first statement, \"Either the splat is morphed or it is quanked,\" implies that at least one of these conditions must be true. The second statement, \"The splat is not quanked,\" rules out one of those possibilities. Therefore, if the splat is not quanked, then the only remaining option from the first statement is that the splat must be morphed. This follows the logical pattern known as disjunctive syllogism.\n\nAnswer: yes"
