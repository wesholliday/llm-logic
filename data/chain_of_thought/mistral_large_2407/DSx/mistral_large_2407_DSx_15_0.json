            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a disjunction (or statement) and a negation. The first statement, \"Either the dreb is vroombed or it is spened,\" implies that at least one of these conditions must be true. The second statement, \"The dreb is not spened,\" rules out one of those possibilities. Therefore, if the dreb is not spened, then the only remaining option from the first statement is that the dreb must be vroombed. This follows the logical principle known as disjunctive syllogism.\n\nAnswer: yes"
