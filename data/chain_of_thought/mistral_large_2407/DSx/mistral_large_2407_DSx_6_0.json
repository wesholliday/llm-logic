            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a logical disjunction (or statement) and a negation. The first statement, \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it is plopped,\" means that at least one of these conditions must be true. The second statement, \"The grommet is not plopped,\" negates one of these conditions. If the grommet is not plopped, then the only remaining option from the first statement is that the grommet must be sploffed. This follows the logical principle known as disjunctive syllogism.\n\nAnswer: yes"
