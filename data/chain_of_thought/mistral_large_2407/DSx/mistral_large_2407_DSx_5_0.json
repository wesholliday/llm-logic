The second statement tells us that the zinger is not smoogled. If the zinger were not fraggled, then according to the first statement, it would have to be smoogled. But this contradicts the second statement. Therefore, the only possibility that does not lead to a contradiction is that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
