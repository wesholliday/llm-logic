It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink. (\u00acQ)\n\nWe are asked if we can infer 'The grommet was not sploffed' (\u00acP).\n\nAccording to modus tollens, a valid form of argument, if the consequent (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false. In other words, if 'the grommet must have plopped the frink' is false, then 'the grommet was sploffed' must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes"
