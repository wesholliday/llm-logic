It's not the case that the wug must have bimmed the zoint. (\u00acQ)\n\nWe are asked if we can infer 'The wug was not flooped' (\u00acP).\n\nAccording to modus tollens, a valid form of argument, if the consequent (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false. In other words, if it's not the case that the wug must have bimmed the zoint (\u00acQ), and we know that being flooped implies bimming the zoint (P \u2192 Q), then it must be the case that the wug was not flooped (\u00acP).\n\nAnswer: yes"
