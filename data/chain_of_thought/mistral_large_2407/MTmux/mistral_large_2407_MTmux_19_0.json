            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a conditional and a negation. The first statement, \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged,\" can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the smonk was vreebled\" and Q is \"the smonk must have plagged.\" The second statement, \"It's not the case that the smonk must have plagged,\" is the negation of Q, represented as \u00acQ.\n\nIn logic, if we have P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then we can infer \u00acP. This is known as modus tollens, a valid form of argument. Applying this to our statements, if the smonk must have plagged (Q) is not the case (\u00acQ), then we can infer that the smonk was not vreebled (\u00acP).\n\nAnswer: yes"
