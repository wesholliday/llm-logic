(In this case, \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened.\")\n2. Not-Q. (\"It's not the case that the dreb must have been spened.\")\n3. Therefore, not-P. (\"The dreb was not vroombed.\")\n\nIf the dreb being vroombed necessitates that it must have been spened, and we know that it's not the case that the dreb must have been spened, then it logically follows that the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes."
