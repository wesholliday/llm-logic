It's not the case that the smip must have lupped the zoint. (\u00acQ)\n\nWe are asked if we can infer 'The smip was not shripped' (\u00acP).\n\nAccording to modus tollens, a valid form of argument, if the consequent (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false. In other words, if 'the smip must have lupped the zoint' is not the case, then 'the smip was shripped' cannot be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
