The first statement is a conditional: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked.\" This can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the splat was morphed\" and Q is \"the splat must have quanked.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the splat must have quanked.\" This can be written as \u00acQ.\n\nNow, let's use these statements to see if we can infer \"The splat was not morphed\" (\u00acP).\n\nIf P \u2192 Q is true and \u00acQ is true, then P must be false (because if P were true, then Q would have to be true, but we know Q is false). Therefore, we can indeed infer \u00acP.\n\nAnswer: yes"
