The first statement is a conditional: \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\" This can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the fleeg was bluttered\" and Q is \"the fleeg must have been surned.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned.\" This is the negation of Q, which can be written as \u00acQ.\n\nNow, let's use these statements to see if we can infer \"The fleeg was not bluttered\" (\u00acP).\n\nAccording to the principle of modus tollens in logic, if P \u2192 Q is true and \u00acQ is true, then we can infer \u00acP.\n\nIn other words, if it's true that \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned\" and it's also true that \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned,\" then we can validly conclude that \"The fleeg was not bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
