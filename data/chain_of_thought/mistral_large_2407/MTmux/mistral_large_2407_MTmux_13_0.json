(In this case, \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged.\")\n2. Not-Q. (\"It's not the case that the glip must have tragged.\")\n3. Therefore, not-P. (\"The glip was not slogged.\")\n\nIf the glip was slogged, it would have tragged. But we know it didn't trag, so it couldn't have been slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes."
