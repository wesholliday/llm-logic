It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink. (\u00acQ)\n\nWe are asked if we can infer 'The sneg was not crampled' (\u00acP).\n\nAccording to modus tollens, a valid form of argument, if the consequent (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false. In other words, if it's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink (\u00acQ), and we know that if the sneg was crampled then it must have sproted the frink (P \u2192 Q), we can validly conclude that the sneg was not crampled (\u00acP).\n\nAnswer: yes."
