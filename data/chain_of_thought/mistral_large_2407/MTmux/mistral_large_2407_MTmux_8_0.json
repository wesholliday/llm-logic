            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled.\" This can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and Q is \"the sprocket must have been daggled.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled.\" This can be written as \u00acQ, where \u00ac denotes negation.\n\n3. We want to determine if we can infer \"The sprocket was not cranked,\" which can be written as \u00acP.\n\n4. According to the logical principle of modus tollens, if P \u2192 Q is true and \u00acQ is true, then \u00acP must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and modus tollens, we can indeed infer that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
