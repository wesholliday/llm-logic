It's not the case that the zinger must have been smoogled. (\u00acQ)\n\nWe are asked if we can infer 'The zinger was not fraggled' (\u00acP).\n\nAccording to modus tollens, a valid form of argument, if the consequent (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false. In other words, if it's not the case that the zinger must have been smoogled (\u00acQ), and we know that being fraggled implies being smoogled (P \u2192 Q), then it must be the case that the zinger was not fraggled (\u00acP).\n\nAnswer: yes"
