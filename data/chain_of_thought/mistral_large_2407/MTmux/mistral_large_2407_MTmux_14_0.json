(If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged.)\n2. Not-Q. (It's not the case that the clug must have been snugged.)\n3. Therefore, not-P. (The clug was not fleeked.)\n\nIf the original statement is true (If P, then Q) and we know that Q is false (Not-Q), then P must also be false (Not-P). This is a valid inference in logical reasoning.\n\nAnswer: yes."
