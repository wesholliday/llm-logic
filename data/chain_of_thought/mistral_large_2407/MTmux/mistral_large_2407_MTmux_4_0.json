            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step. We have two statements:\n\n1. If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked. (This is a conditional statement, which can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the fribble was snurgled\" and Q is \"the fribble must have crinked.\")\n2. It's not the case that the fribble must have crinked. (This is the negation of Q, which can be written as \u00acQ.)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The fribble was not snurgled\" (which is \u00acP).\n\nAccording to the logical principle of modus tollens, if P \u2192 Q is true and \u00acQ is true, then \u00acP must be true. In other words, if the second statement is true (the fribble did not crink), then the condition of the first statement (the fribble was snurgled) cannot be true.\n\nAnswer: yes."
