            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled.\" This can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the wug was sproinged\" and Q is \"the wug must have been garpled.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the wug must have been garpled.\" This can be written as \u00acQ.\n\nNow, let's use these statements to see if we can infer \"The wug was not sproinged\" (\u00acP).\n\nIn classical logic, if we have P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then we can indeed infer \u00acP. This is known as modus tollens, a valid form of argument.\n\nSo, if the wug must have been garpled if it was sproinged, but it's not the case that the wug must have been garpled, then it logically follows that the wug was not sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes"
