The first statement is a conditional: \"If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished.\" This can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the twonk was plinked\" and Q is \"the twonk must have been varnished.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the twonk must have been varnished.\" This can be written as \u00acQ.\n\n3. We want to determine if we can infer \"The twonk was not plinked\" (\u00acP).\n\n4. According to the logical principle of modus tollens, if P \u2192 Q is true and \u00acQ is true, then \u00acP must be true.\n\n5. Applying modus tollens to our statements, we can indeed infer \"The twonk was not plinked\" (\u00acP).\n\nAnswer: yes"
