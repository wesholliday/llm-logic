(In this case, \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed.\")\n2. Not-Q. (\"It's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed.\")\n3. Therefore, not-P. (\"The flug was not blummed.\")\n\nIf the flug being blummed necessitates that it must have been zimmed, and we know that it's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed, then it logically follows that the flug was not blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes."
