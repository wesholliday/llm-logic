It's not the case that the flugel must have been zargled. (\u00acQ)\n\nWe are asked if we can infer 'The flugel was not blimmed' (\u00acP).\n\nAccording to modus tollens, a valid form of argument, if the consequent (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) is also false. In other words, if 'the flugel must have been zargled' is false, then 'the flugel was blimmed' must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes"
