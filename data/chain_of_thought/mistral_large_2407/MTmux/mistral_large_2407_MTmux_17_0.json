(In this case, \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated.\")\n2. Not-Q. (\"It's not the case that the flob must have movated.\")\n3. Therefore, not-P. (\"The flob was not skizzled.\")\n\nIf the second premise (not-Q) is true, then the first premise (If P, then Q) implies that P cannot be true. Therefore, we can indeed infer \"The flob was not skizzled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
