This structure is in the form of \"Either P or Q\" and \"Not P\", which allows us to infer \"Q\". In this case, \"P\" is \"the dreb is spened\" and \"Q\" is \"the dreb is vroombed\". Since we are given that \"the dreb is not spened\" (Not P), we can logically infer that \"the dreb is vroombed\" (Q).\n\nAnswer: yes"
