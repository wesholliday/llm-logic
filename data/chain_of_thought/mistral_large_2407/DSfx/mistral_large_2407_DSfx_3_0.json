            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a disjunction (either/or) and a negation. The first statement, \"Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed,\" implies that one of these two conditions must be true. The second statement, \"The splat is not quanked,\" rules out one of those conditions. Therefore, if the splat is not quanked, then according to the first statement, the only remaining possibility is that the splat is morphed. This follows the logical pattern known as disjunctive syllogism.\n\nAnswer: yes"
