            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a logical disjunction and a negation. The first statement, \"Either the fribble is crinked or it is snurgled,\" can be represented as P or Q, where P is \"the fribble is crinked\" and Q is \"the fribble is snurgled.\" The second statement, \"The fribble is not crinked,\" is the negation of P, represented as not P.\n\nIn logic, if we have a disjunction (P or Q) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false (not P), then we can infer that the other disjunct must be true (Q). This is known as the disjunctive syllogism.\n\nTherefore, if \"The fribble is not crinked\" (not P) is true, then according to the first statement, \"The fribble is snurgled\" (Q) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
