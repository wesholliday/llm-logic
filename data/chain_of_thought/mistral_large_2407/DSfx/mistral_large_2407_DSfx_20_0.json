            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a logical disjunction and a negation. The first statement, \"Either the fleeg is surned or it is bluttered,\" can be represented as P or Q, where P is \"the fleeg is surned\" and Q is \"the fleeg is bluttered.\" The second statement, \"The fleeg is not surned,\" is the negation of P, represented as not P.\n\nIn logic, if we have a disjunction (P or Q) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false (not P), then we can infer that the other disjunct must be true (Q). This is known as the disjunctive syllogism.\n\nTherefore, if \"The fleeg is not surned\" (not P) is true, then according to the first statement, \"The fleeg is bluttered\" (Q) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
