            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a disjunction (either/or) and a negation. The first statement, \"Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked,\" implies that at least one of these conditions must be true. The second statement, \"The sprocket is not daggled,\" rules out one of those possibilities. Therefore, if the sprocket is not daggled, the only remaining option from the first statement is that the sprocket must be cranked. This follows the logical principle known as disjunctive syllogism.\n\nAnswer: yes"
