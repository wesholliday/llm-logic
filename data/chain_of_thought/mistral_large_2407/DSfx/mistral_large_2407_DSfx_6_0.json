            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a disjunction (either/or) and a negation. The first statement, \"Either the grommet is plopped or it is sploffed,\" implies that one of these two conditions must be true. The second statement, \"The grommet is not plopped,\" eliminates one of those possibilities. Therefore, if the grommet is not plopped, the only remaining option from the first statement is that the grommet must be sploffed. This follows the principle of disjunctive syllogism in logic.\n\nAnswer: yes"
