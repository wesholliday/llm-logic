The first statement, \"Either the sneg is sproted or it is crampled,\" implies that at least one of these conditions must be true. The second statement, \"The sneg is not sproted,\" negates the first condition. Therefore, if the first condition is false, then according to the first statement, the second condition must be true. Hence, we can infer that \"The sneg is crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
