            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a disjunction (either/or) and a negation. The first statement, \"Either the smonk is plagged or it is vreebled,\" implies that at least one of these conditions must be true. The second statement, \"The smonk is not plagged,\" negates one of these conditions. If the smonk is not plagged, then the only remaining option from the first statement is that the smonk must be vreebled. This follows the principle of disjunctive syllogism in logic.\n\nAnswer: yes"
