It doesn't provide a definitive statement about the splat's status.\n2. \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked\" presents two possibilities: the splat is morphed, or it is quanked.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The splat is morphed,\" we need to consider both statements together. Since the first statement allows for the possibility that the splat is not quanked, and the second statement requires that if the splat is not morphed, then it must be quanked, the only way to satisfy both conditions is if the splat is morphed. If the splat were not morphed, then according to the second statement, it must be quanked, which contradicts the possibility presented in the first statement.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent conclusion is that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
