It doesn't confirm whether the grommet is plopped or not; it just leaves open the possibility that it isn't.\n\n2. \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped\" presents two possibilities: the grommet is either sploffed or plopped.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The grommet is sploffed,\" we need to consider both statements together. If the grommet might not be plopped (from the first statement), then according to the second statement, the only remaining option is that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can conclude that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
