We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The fribble might not be crinked.\" This means that it's possible the fribble is not crinked, but it doesn't exclude the possibility that it is crinked.\n2. \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked.\" This means that if the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled.\n\nNow, if we assume the fribble is not crinked (which is possible according to the first statement), then according to the second statement, the fribble must be snurgled.\n\nTherefore, based on these two statements, we can infer that \"The fribble is snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
