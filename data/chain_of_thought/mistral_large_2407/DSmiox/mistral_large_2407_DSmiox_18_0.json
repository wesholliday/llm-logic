It doesn't confirm whether the shank is nugged or not.\n2. \"Either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged\" implies that if the shank is not nugged, then it must be plooked.\n\nNow, combining these two statements, if the shank might not be nugged (from the first statement), then according to the second statement, the shank must be plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
