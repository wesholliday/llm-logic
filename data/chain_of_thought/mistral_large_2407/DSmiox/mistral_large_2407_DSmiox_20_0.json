The first statement is \"The fleeg might not be surned.\" This implies that there is a possibility that the fleeg is not surned, but it doesn't exclude the possibility that it is surned.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned.\" This means that if the fleeg is not bluttered, then it must be surned.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- If the fleeg is not bluttered, then according to the second statement, it must be surned.\n- However, the first statement tells us that the fleeg might not be surned, which means it's possible that the fleeg is not surned.\n\nSince the fleeg might not be surned, the only way for the second statement to be true is if the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes"
