We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The twonk might not be plinked\" - This implies that it's possible the twonk is not plinked.\n2. \"Either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked\" - This implies that if the twonk is not plinked, then it must be varnished.\n\nIf we combine these two statements, we can see that since it's possible the twonk is not plinked (from the first statement), then according to the second statement, the twonk must be varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes"
