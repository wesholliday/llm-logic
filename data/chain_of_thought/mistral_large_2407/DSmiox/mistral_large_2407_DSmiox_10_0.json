We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The wug might not be garpled.\" This implies that \"The wug is not garpled\" is a possibility.\n2. \"Either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled.\" This gives us two options: the wug is either sproinged or garpled.\n\nIf the wug is not garpled (which is a possibility according to the first statement), then according to the second statement, it must be sproinged. Therefore, we can infer that \"The wug is sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
