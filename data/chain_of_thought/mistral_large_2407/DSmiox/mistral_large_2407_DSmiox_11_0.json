We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The flug might not be zimmed.\" This implies that \"The flug is not zimmed\" is a possibility, but it's not certain.\n2. \"Either the flug is blummed or it must be zimmed.\" This gives us two options: either the flug is blummed, or it is zimmed.\n\nNow, if the flug is not zimmed (which is a possibility according to the first statement), then according to the second statement, the flug must be blummed. So, while it's not certain that the flug is blummed, it's a logical consequence if the flug is not zimmed. Therefore, we can infer that \"The flug is blummed\" is a possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes."
