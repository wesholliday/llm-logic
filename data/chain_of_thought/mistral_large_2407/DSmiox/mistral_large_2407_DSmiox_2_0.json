'Either the wug is flooped or it must be bimmed'\n\nThe first statement tells us that it's possible the wug is not bimmed. The second statement presents two possibilities: either the wug is flooped or it is bimmed.\n\nIf we assume the wug is not flooped, then according to the second statement, it must be bimmed. However, this contradicts the first statement, which says the wug might not be bimmed. Therefore, the assumption that the wug is not flooped must be false. So, we can conclude that the wug is flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes"
