It doesn't confirm whether the clug is snugged or not.\n2. \"Either the clug is fleeked or it must be snugged\" implies that if the clug is not fleeked, then it must be snugged.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- If the clug is not fleeked, then according to the second statement, it must be snugged.\n- However, the first statement tells us that the clug might not be snugged.\n- Therefore, the only possibility that satisfies both statements is that the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
