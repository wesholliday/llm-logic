It doesn't exclude the possibility that the smonk is plagged, but it introduces uncertainty.\n\n2. \"Either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged\" presents two possibilities: the smonk is either vreebled or plagged.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The smonk is vreebled,\" we need to consider both statements together. Since the first statement allows for the possibility that the smonk is not plagged, the second statement then implies that if the smonk is not plagged, it must be vreebled. Therefore, given the uncertainty introduced by the first statement, the second statement leads us to conclude that the smonk could indeed be vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
