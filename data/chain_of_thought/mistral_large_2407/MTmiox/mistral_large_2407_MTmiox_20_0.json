The first statement is \"The fleeg might not have been surned.\" This implies that there is a possibility that the fleeg was not surned.\n2. The second statement is \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\" This implies that being bluttered is a sufficient condition for being surned.\n\nNow, let's consider the contrapositive of the second statement: \"If the fleeg was not surned, then it was not bluttered.\" This is logically equivalent to the second statement.\n\nCombining the first statement and the contrapositive, we can infer that since there is a possibility that the fleeg was not surned, there is also a possibility that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes"
