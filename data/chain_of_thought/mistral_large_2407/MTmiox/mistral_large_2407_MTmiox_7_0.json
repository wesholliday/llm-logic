We are given that \"The whiffle might not have tinked.\" This statement tells us that it is possible that the whiffle did not tink.\n2. We are also given that \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked.\" This statement tells us that shanking the whiffle is a sufficient condition for the whiffle to have tinked.\n3. Now, let's consider the contrapositive of the second statement: \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked.\" This is logically equivalent to the second statement.\n4. Since we know that it is possible that the whiffle did not tink (from the first statement), applying the contrapositive, we can infer that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
