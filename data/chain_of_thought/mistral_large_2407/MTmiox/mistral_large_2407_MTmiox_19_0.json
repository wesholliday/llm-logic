We have the statement \"The smonk might not have plagged,\" which implies that it's possible that the smonk did not plag.\n2. The second statement is \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged.\" This means that being vreebled is a sufficient condition for having plagged.\n3. If the smonk was vreebled, then it must have plagged (from the second statement). However, we know that the smonk might not have plagged (from the first statement).\n4. Therefore, since the smonk might not have plagged, it cannot be the case that the smonk was vreebled, because being vreebled would definitely mean it had plagged.\n\nAnswer: yes"
