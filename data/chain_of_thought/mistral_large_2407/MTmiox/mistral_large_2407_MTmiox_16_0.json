We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The sneg might not have sproted the frink.\" This implies that there is a possibility that the sneg did not sprote the frink.\n2. \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink.\" This is a conditional statement that tells us if the sneg is crampled, then it definitely sproted the frink.\n\nNow, let's consider the contrapositive of the second statement: \"If the sneg did not sprote the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\" This must be true because it's logically equivalent to the second statement.\n\nGiven the first statement, there is a possibility that the sneg did not sprote the frink. According to the contrapositive, if that's the case, then the sneg was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes."
