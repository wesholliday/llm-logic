This means it's possible that the twonk was not varnished.\n2. We are also given that if the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished. This means that being plinked is a sufficient condition for being varnished.\n3. If the twonk was not varnished, then it couldn't have been plinked, because being plinked requires being varnished.\n4. Therefore, if it's possible that the twonk was not varnished, then it's possible that the twonk was not plinked.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively say that the twonk was not plinked, because the first statement only tells us that it's possible the twonk was not varnished, not that it definitely wasn't.\n\nAnswer: no"
