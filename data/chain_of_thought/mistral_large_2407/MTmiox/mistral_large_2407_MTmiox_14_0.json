We are also given that \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged.\" This means that being fleeked is a sufficient condition for the clug to have been snugged.\n3. If the clug was fleeked, then it must have been snugged. But since we know that the clug might not have been snugged, this implies that the clug could not have been fleeked, because being fleeked guarantees that it would have been snugged.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
