If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that \"The sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\nThe second statement tells us that if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled. This can be written logically as:\n\nCranked \u2192 Daggled\n\nThe contrapositive of this statement is:\n\nNot Daggled \u2192 Not Cranked\n\nThe first statement tells us that the sprocket might not have been daggled, which means \"Not Daggled\" is a possibility. According to the contrapositive, if \"Not Daggled\" is true, then \"Not Cranked\" must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
