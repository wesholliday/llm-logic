            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and reason through them step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is \"The splat might not have quanked.\" This implies that there is a possibility that the splat did not quank, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that it did.\n\n2. The second statement is \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked.\" This is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between being morphed and having quanked.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The splat was not morphed,\" we need to consider the contrapositive of the second statement. The contrapositive of \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked\" is \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed.\"\n\nGiven that the first statement allows for the possibility that the splat did not quank, applying the contrapositive, we can indeed infer that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
