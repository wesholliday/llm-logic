            "content": "Explanation: Let's reason through this step by step. We have two statements:\n\n1. 'The fribble might not have crinked', which implies that 'crinked' is not necessarily true for the fribble.\n2. 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked', which implies that if 'snurgled' is true, then 'crinked' must also be true.\n\nNow, let's consider if the fribble was snurgled. According to the second statement, this would mean the fribble must have crinked. However, this contradicts the first statement, which says the fribble might not have crinked. Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, we conclude that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
