It does not imply that Chris finishing the race means Alex must have finished. However, we are also told that Chris did indeed finish the race. Since the only information given about Alex is that if Alex finished, then Chris finished, we cannot use the fact that Chris finished to definitively say that Alex finished. There could be other reasons why Chris finished the race that are not dependent on Alex finishing. Therefore, we cannot infer that Alex finished the race based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no"
