The pants were denim.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement (if A, then B), which doesn't necessarily mean that if B is true, A must be true. In other words, just because the pants were denim, it doesn't mean that the shirt had to be cotton; there could be other types of shirts that also go with denim pants. The second statement only confirms the second part of the conditional statement, not the first. Therefore, we cannot infer that the shirt was cotton based solely on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
