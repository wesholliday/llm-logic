            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement. It means that if the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the consequence (the banana being yellow) must also be true. However, the reverse is not necessarily true. Just because the banana is yellow, it does not necessarily mean that the apple was red. The banana could be yellow for other reasons, and the apple could be a different color. Therefore, we cannot infer that the apple was red based solely on the information that the banana was yellow.\n\nAnswer: no"
