The muffins were blueberry.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that the cake was chocolate based on these statements. The first statement is a conditional statement (if A, then B). The second statement confirms that B is true (the muffins were blueberry). However, in logic, confirming the consequent (B) does not necessarily prove the antecedent (A). In other words, just because the muffins were blueberry does not mean that the cake must have been chocolate. There could be other reasons or conditions that led to the muffins being blueberry. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the cake was chocolate based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
