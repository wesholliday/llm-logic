            "content": "Explanation: The statement gives us two pieces of information. First, it tells us that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This can be written as \"If Lisa -> Mark\". The second piece of information is that Mark bought the blue shirt. However, the initial statement does not provide any information about what happens if Mark buys the blue shirt. It only tells us about Mark's action given Lisa's action. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about Lisa's action based solely on Mark's action.\n\nAnswer: no"
