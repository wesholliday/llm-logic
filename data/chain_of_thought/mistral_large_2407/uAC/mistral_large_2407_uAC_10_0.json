The cat was outside.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that the dog was inside based on these statements. The first statement is a conditional statement (if A, then B). The second statement tells us that B is true (the cat was outside). However, in a conditional statement, knowing that B is true does not necessarily mean that A is true. In other words, just because the cat was outside, we cannot definitively say that the dog was inside; the cat could be outside for reasons unrelated to the dog's location.\n\nAnswer: no"
