However, confirming the consequent does not necessarily prove the antecedent (A). In other words, just because the book is a mystery novel doesn't mean it was definitely written by James; it could have been written by someone else. This is a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the book was written by James based solely on these statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
