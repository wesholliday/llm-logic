However, it does not imply that Joe going to the park is the only reason Lucy could go to the zoo. Since we know Lucy went to the zoo, but we don't have information that her going to the zoo is solely dependent on Joe going to the park, we cannot infer that Joe went to the park based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
