            "content": "Explanation: The statement gives us two pieces of information. First, it tells us that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was also awake. This can be written logically as \"If Vampire awake \u2192 Mummy awake\". The second piece of information is that the mummy was indeed awake. To determine if the vampire was awake, we need to consider the contrapositive of the first statement, which is \"If Mummy not awake \u2192 Vampire not awake\". Since the mummy was awake, the contrapositive doesn't help us. However, the original statement doesn't guarantee that the vampire being awake is the only condition for the mummy to be awake. There could be other reasons for the mummy to be awake. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the vampire was awake based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no"
