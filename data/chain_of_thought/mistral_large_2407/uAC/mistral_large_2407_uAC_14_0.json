            "content": "Explanation: The statement gives us two pieces of information. First, it tells us that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. This can be written as a conditional statement: \"If bear in cave, then wolf in den.\" The second piece of information is that the wolf was indeed in the den. To determine if the bear was in the cave, we can use the logical rule known as modus ponens, which states that if the condition is true (wolf in den), then the hypothesis (bear in cave) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
