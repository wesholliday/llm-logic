The truck was metal.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement (if A, then B), which doesn't necessarily mean that if B is true, A must be true. In other words, just because the truck was metal, it doesn't mean that the doll had to be plastic; the doll could be made of any material. The second statement only confirms the truck's material, not the doll's. Therefore, we cannot infer that the doll was plastic based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
