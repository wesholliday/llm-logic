The first statement is \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\" This can be rephrased as \"The cookies do not have to be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry.\" This gives us two possible locations for the cookies: the jar or the pantry.\n\nNow, since the first statement eliminates the pantry as a necessary hiding spot, the only remaining option from the second statement is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes"
