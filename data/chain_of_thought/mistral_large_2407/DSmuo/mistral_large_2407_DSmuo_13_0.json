The first statement is \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\" This can be rephrased as \"The toy is not sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\" This gives us two possible locations for the toy: in the toy box or on the bookshelf.\n\nNow, if we combine these two statements, we know that the toy cannot be on the bookshelf (from the first statement). Therefore, the only remaining option from the second statement is that the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
