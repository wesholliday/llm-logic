The first statement is \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\" This can be interpreted as \"The pen does not have to be on my desk\" or \"It is not necessarily true that the pen is on my desk.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the pen is in the bag, or it must be on the desk.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- Since it's not necessarily true that the pen is on the desk (from the first statement), the only way the second statement can be true is if the pen is in the bag.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
