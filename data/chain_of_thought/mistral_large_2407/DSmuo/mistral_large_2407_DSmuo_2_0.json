The first statement is \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\" This can be rephrased as \"The book is not necessarily on the table.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\" This gives us two possibilities: the book is on the shelf or the book is on the table.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. Since the first statement tells us that the book is not necessarily on the table, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes"
