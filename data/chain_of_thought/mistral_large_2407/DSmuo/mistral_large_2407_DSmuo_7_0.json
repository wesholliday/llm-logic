The first statement is \"It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\" This can be rewritten as \"The umbrella does not have to be in the closet.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet.\" This gives us two possibilities: the umbrella is in the car, or it is in the closet.\n\n3. Since the first statement negates the second part of the second statement (\"it must be tucked away in the closet\"), we are left with the first part of the second statement: \"The umbrella is in the car.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes"
