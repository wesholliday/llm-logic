The first statement is \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\" This can be rephrased as \"The watch is not on his wrist.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\" This gives us two possibilities: the watch is charging on the dresser, or the watch is on his wrist.\n\nNow, since we know from the first statement that the watch is not on his wrist, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that \"The watch is charging on the dresser.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
