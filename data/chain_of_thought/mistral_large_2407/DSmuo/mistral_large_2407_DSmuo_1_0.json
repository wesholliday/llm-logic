The first statement is \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" This can be rephrased as \"Fido does not have to be in the garden,\" which means Fido could be anywhere else, including inside.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\" This gives us two possibilities: either Fido is inside, or Fido must be in the garden.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. Since we know from the first statement that Fido does not have to be in the garden, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that Fido is inside.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes"
