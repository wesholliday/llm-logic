The first statement is \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\" This can be rephrased as \"The jacket is not necessarily hanging in the closet.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet.\" This gives us two possibilities: either the jacket is on the chair, or it is necessarily in the closet.\n\nNow, if the jacket were necessarily in the closet, it would contradict the first statement. Since we know from the first statement that the jacket is not necessarily in the closet, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes"
