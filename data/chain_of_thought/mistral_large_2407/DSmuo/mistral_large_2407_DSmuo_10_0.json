The first statement is \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\" This can be rephrased as \"The missing sock is not necessarily under the bed.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed.\" This presents two possibilities: the sock is in the laundry basket or it is under the bed.\n\nNow, if the sock is not necessarily under the bed (from the first statement), then the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes"
