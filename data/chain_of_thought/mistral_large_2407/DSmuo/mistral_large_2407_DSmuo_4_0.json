The first statement is \"It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom.\" This can be rephrased as \"The cat is not necessarily playing in the bedroom.\"\n2. The second statement is \"Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom.\" This presents two possibilities: either the cat is napping on the couch, or the cat is necessarily playing in the bedroom.\n\nGiven that the first statement rules out the necessity of the cat playing in the bedroom, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the cat is napping on the couch. Therefore, we can indeed infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes"
