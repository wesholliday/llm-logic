The first statement is \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\" This can be rephrased as \"The notebook is not necessarily on the nightstand.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\" This gives us two possible locations for the notebook: in the drawer or on the nightstand.\n\nNow, if the notebook is not necessarily on the nightstand (as per the first statement), then the only other option given by the second statement is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
