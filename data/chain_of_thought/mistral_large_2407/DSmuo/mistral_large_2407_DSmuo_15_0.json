The first statement is \"It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door.\" This can be rewritten as \"The shoes do not have to be lined up by the door.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door.\" This gives us two possibilities: either the shoes are in the closet, or they must be lined up by the door.\n\nNow, since the first statement tells us that the shoes do not have to be lined up by the door, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes"
