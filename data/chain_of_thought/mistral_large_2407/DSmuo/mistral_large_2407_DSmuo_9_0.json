The first statement is \"It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\" This can be rephrased as \"The missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor.\" This presents two possibilities: the piece is in the box, or it is blending in on the floor.\n\nGiven that we know from the first statement that the piece is not blending in on the floor, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the piece must be in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
