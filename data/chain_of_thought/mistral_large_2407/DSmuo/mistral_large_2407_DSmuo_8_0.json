The first statement is \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\" This can be rephrased as \"The remote control is not necessarily hiding under the couch.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\" This presents two possibilities: the remote control is on the coffee table, or it is hiding under the couch.\n\nGiven that the first statement rules out the necessity of the remote control being under the couch, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the remote control is on the coffee table. Therefore, we can indeed infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes"
