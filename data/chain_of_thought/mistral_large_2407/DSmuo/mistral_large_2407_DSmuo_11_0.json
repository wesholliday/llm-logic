The first statement is \"It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch.\" This can be rephrased as \"The newspaper is not necessarily on the porch.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch.\" This gives us two possibilities: the newspaper is in the driveway, or it is on the porch.\n\nNow, if the newspaper were definitely on the porch, it would contradict the first statement. Since the first statement tells us that it's not necessarily on the porch, the only remaining option from the second statement is that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes"
