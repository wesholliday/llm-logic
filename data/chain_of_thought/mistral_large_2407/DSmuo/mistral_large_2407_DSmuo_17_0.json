The first statement is \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\" This can be rephrased as \"The scarf is not draped on the coat rack.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack.\" This gives us two possible locations for the scarf: in the backpack or on the coat rack.\n\n3. Since we know from the first statement that the scarf is not on the coat rack, we can eliminate that option from the second statement.\n\n4. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes"
