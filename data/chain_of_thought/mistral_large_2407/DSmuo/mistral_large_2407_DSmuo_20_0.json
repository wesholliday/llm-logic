The first statement is \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\" This can be rephrased as \"The sunglasses are not perched on her head.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\" This gives us two possible locations for the sunglasses: in her bag or on her head.\n\nNow, since we know from the first statement that the sunglasses are not on her head, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
