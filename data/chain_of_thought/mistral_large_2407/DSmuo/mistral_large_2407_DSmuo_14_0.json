The first statement is \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\" This can be rephrased as \"The milk is not necessarily in the fridge.\"\n2. The second statement is \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\" This gives us two possibilities: the milk is on the counter, or the milk is in the fridge.\n\nNow, if the milk was definitely in the fridge, it would contradict the first statement. Since the first statement tells us that the milk is not necessarily in the fridge, the only other option given by the second statement is that the milk is on the counter.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes"
