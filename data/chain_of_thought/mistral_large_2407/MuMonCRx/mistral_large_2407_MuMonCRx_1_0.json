            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The wumble must be frazzle and quibble a quazzle\" contains two conditions connected by an \"and\". This means that both conditions must be true for the entire statement to be true. If we remove one condition (\"frazzle\"), we are left with \"The wumble must be quibble a quazzle\". Since the original statement requires both conditions to be true, if the original statement is true, then the wumble must indeed be \"quibble a quazzle\". Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
