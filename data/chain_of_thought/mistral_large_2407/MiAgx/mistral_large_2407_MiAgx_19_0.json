            "content": "Explanation: The given sentence \"The crunk might be wibble fribble and the frazzle might quork snork\" is in the form of a possibility for two separate events. The sentence structure suggests that both events are independent possibilities, not necessarily happening together. The inferred sentence \"It might be that the crunk is wibble fribble and the frazzle quorks snork\" suggests a single possibility where both events happen together. Since the original sentence does not exclude this combined possibility, we can indeed infer the second sentence from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
