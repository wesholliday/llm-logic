            "content": "Explanation: The given sentence \"The blimp might be in the wozzle and the flonk might quibble plonk\" uses the modal verb \"might\" to express possibility for both parts of the sentence. When we change the sentence to \"It might be that the blimp is in the wozzle and the flonk quibbles plonk\", we are still expressing the same possibility for both parts, just in a different sentence structure. The meaning and the uncertainty expressed by \"might\" remains the same in both sentences.\n\nAnswer: yes"
