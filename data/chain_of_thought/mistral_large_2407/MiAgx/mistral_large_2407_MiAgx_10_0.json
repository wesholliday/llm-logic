It does not explicitly combine these possibilities into a single scenario. However, the phrase \"It might be that the snorkel is plonk and the snork is wibble\" suggests a single scenario where both conditions are true simultaneously. Since the original statement does not exclude this combined scenario, it is a possible inference.\n\nAnswer: yes"
