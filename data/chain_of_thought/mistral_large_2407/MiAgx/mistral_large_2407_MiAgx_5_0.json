            "content": "Explanation: The given sentence \"The frozz might be frozz fribble and the wibble might wozzle to be shimble for\" suggests a possibility for both parts. When we rephrase it to \"It might be that the frozz is frozz fribble and the wibble wozzles to be shimble for\", we are still maintaining the same level of possibility for both parts. The rephrased sentence is just a different way of expressing the same idea, using \"it might be that\" instead of \"might\" for each part. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
