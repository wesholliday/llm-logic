            "content": "Explanation: The given sentence \"The snorkel might be grooble frazzle and the quibble might blimple gronk blimple\" is in the form of a possibility statement using \"might\". When we rephrase it to \"It might be that the snorkel is grooble frazzle and the quibble blimples gronk blimple\", we are essentially maintaining the same possibility statement, just in a different structure. The use of \"might\" in both sentences indicates that the same level of uncertainty is being expressed. Therefore, the meaning of the sentence remains the same, and one can be inferred from the other.\n\nAnswer: yes"
