            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement. It tells us that a red apple implies a yellow banana, but it does not provide information in the reverse direction. In other words, the banana being yellow does not necessarily mean that the apple was red; the banana could be yellow for other reasons. This is because the original statement does not claim that a red apple is the only condition for a yellow banana. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\n\nAnswer: no"
