This does not necessarily mean that Sue's presence implies Mary's presence. In other words, \"Sue \u2192 Mary\" is not necessarily true. Sue could have been at the wedding with or without Mary. The original statement only provides information about Sue's presence when Mary is present, not the other way around.\n\nAnswer: no"
