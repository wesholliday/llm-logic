            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the condition (the car being red) is true, then the consequence (the truck being blue) is also true. However, it does not provide any information about what happens when the truck is blue. In other words, the truck being blue does not necessarily imply that the car was red; the car could be any color. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the truck was blue, then the car was red.\n\nAnswer: no"
