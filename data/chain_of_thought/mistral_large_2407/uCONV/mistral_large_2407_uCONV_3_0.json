To determine if the converse is true (i.e., \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James\"), we need to consider that the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. In this case, there could be other authors who write mystery novels. Therefore, just because a book is a mystery novel, it does not necessarily mean it was written by James.\n\nAnswer: no"
