            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow.\" The question asks whether we can infer the statement \"If not P, then not Q,\" which is known as the inverse of the original conditional statement. In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true based solely on the truth of the original statement. Therefore, we cannot logically infer \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow\" from \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
