            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is an example of a conditional statement in logic, which is of the form \"If P, then Q\". The statement given is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\". The question asks if we can infer \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake\". This is known as the contrapositive of the original statement, which is of the form \"If not-Q, then not-P\". In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning if one is true, the other must also be true. However, the statement we are asked to infer is \"If not-P, then not-Q\", which is known as the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the inverse from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
