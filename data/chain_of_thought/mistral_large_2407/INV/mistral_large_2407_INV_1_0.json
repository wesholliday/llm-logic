            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding.\" The question asks if we can infer the statement \"If not P, then not Q,\" which is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. However, the correct inference from the original statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P,\" which is the contrapositive. The statement \"If not P, then not Q\" is actually the inverse of the original statement, and it is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
