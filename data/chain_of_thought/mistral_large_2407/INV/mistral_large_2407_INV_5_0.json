            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\" The question asks if we can infer the statement \"If not P, then not Q,\" which is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. However, the correct contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" The statement \"If not P, then not Q\" is actually the inverse of the original statement, not the contrapositive. The truth of the original statement does not guarantee the truth of its inverse. Therefore, we cannot logically infer \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
