            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball.\" The question asks whether we can infer the statement \"If not P, then not Q,\" which is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. However, the correct inference from a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P,\" which is the contrapositive. The statement \"If not P, then not Q\" is actually the inverse of the original statement, and it is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
