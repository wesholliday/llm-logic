            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins were blueberry.\" The question asks whether we can infer the inverse, \"If not P, then not Q.\" However, a conditional statement and its inverse are not logically equivalent. In other words, knowing that \"If P, then Q\" is true does not necessarily mean that \"If not P, then not Q\" is also true. For example, it's possible that the muffins could still be blueberry even if the cake is not chocolate. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the inverse from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
