            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\" The question asks if we can infer the statement \"If not P, then not Q,\" which is known as the contrapositive of the inverse of the original statement. However, the correct inference from a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is its contrapositive \"If not Q, then not P.\" We cannot directly infer \"If not P, then not Q\" from \"If P, then Q.\" These two statements are not logically equivalent, and the truth of one does not necessarily imply the truth of the other.\n\nAnswer: no"
