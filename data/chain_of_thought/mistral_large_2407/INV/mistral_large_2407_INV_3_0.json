            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel.\" The question asks whether we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P,\" or equivalently, \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\" However, the question phrasing is \"If not P, then not Q,\" which is not the contrapositive but rather the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that the truth of the original statement does not guarantee the truth of its inverse. Therefore, we cannot infer the inverse from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
