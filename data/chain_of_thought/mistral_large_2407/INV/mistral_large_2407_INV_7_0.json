            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is an example of a conditional statement in logic, which is of the form \"If P, then Q.\" The question asks whether we can infer \"If not P, then not Q\" from \"If P, then Q.\" In classical logic, these two statements are not equivalent. The inference \"If not P, then not Q\" is known as the contrapositive of the original statement, but to maintain logical equivalence, the contrapositive should be \"If not Q, then not P.\" Therefore, from \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race,\" we cannot logically infer \"If Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
