            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" The question asks if we can infer the inverse, \"If not P, then not Q.\" However, in logic, the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. The truth of the original statement does not guarantee the truth of its inverse. For example, it's possible that Mark bought the blue shirt regardless of whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
