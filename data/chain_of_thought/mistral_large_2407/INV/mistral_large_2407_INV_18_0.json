            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is an implication: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal.\" The question asks if we can infer the inverse implication: \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\" The inverse of P \u2192 Q is \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ. However, the truth of an implication does not necessarily imply the truth of its inverse. For example, if it's true that \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet,\" it doesn't mean that \"If it's not raining, then the ground is not wet\" is also true, because the ground could be wet for other reasons. Therefore, we cannot logically infer \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal\" from \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
