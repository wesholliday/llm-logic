            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim.\" The question asks if we can infer the inverse, \"If not P, then not Q,\" which is \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\" However, a conditional statement and its inverse are not logically equivalent. The truth of the original statement does not guarantee the truth of its inverse. For example, if the shirt was not cotton, the pants could still be denim (e.g., the shirt could be silk and the pants denim). Therefore, we cannot infer the inverse from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
