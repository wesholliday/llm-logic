            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the griffin was in the forest\" and Q is \"the unicorn was in the forest.\" The question asks if we can infer the statement \"If not P, then not Q.\" However, the contrapositive of the original statement, which is logically equivalent, would be \"If not Q, then not P.\" The statement \"If not P, then not Q\" is actually the inverse of the original statement, which is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
