            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" The question asks if we can infer the statement \"If not P, then not Q,\" which is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning if one is true, the other must also be true. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
