            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q is \"Kate ate salad.\" The question asks whether we can infer the statement \"If not P, then not Q,\" which is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, if \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" is true, then \"If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
