            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" and \"The unicorn was not in the forest.\" The first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the griffin was in the forest\" and Q is \"the unicorn was in the forest.\" The second statement is the negation of Q.\n\nIn logic, if we have \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false, we can infer that P must also be false. This is because if P were true, then Q would have to be true (according to the first statement), but we know that Q is false. Therefore, P must be false.\n\nIn this case, since \"the unicorn was not in the forest\" (Q is false), we can infer that \"the griffin was not in the forest\" (P is false).\n\nAnswer: yes"
