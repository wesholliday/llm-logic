            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" and \"The pants were not denim.\" The first statement is a conditional, which can be written as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim.\" The second statement is \"not Q,\" which is \"The pants were not denim.\" In logic, if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"not Q,\" then we can conclude \"not P.\" This is known as modus tollens. Therefore, if the pants were not denim, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes"
