            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and \"Sue was not at the wedding.\" The first statement is a conditional statement, which can be written as \"Mary at wedding \u2192 Sue at wedding.\" The second statement is \"Sue not at wedding.\" If Sue was not at the wedding, and her presence is a consequence of Mary's presence, then Mary's presence would also imply Sue's presence, which contradicts the second statement. Therefore, the only way for both statements to be true is if Mary was not at the wedding. This is an example of modus tollens in logic.\n\nAnswer: yes"
