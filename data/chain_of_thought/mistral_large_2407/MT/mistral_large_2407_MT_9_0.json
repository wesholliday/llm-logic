            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" and \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\" The first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" The second statement is the negation of Q, i.e., \"not Q.\" In logic, if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"not Q,\" then we can infer \"not P.\" This is known as modus tollens. Applying this rule to the given statements, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes"
