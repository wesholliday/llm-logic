The first statement is a conditional, which can be written as \"Vampire awake \u2192 Mummy awake.\" The second statement is \"Mummy not awake.\" If the vampire were awake, it would contradict the second statement because it would imply the mummy is awake. Therefore, the only way for both statements to be true is if the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes"
