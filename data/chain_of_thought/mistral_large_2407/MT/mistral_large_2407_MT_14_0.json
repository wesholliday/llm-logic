            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" and \"The wolf was not in the den.\" The first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the bear was in the cave\" and Q is \"the wolf was in the den.\" The second statement is the negation of Q, i.e., \"not Q.\" In logic, if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"not Q,\" then we can infer \"not P.\" This is known as modus tollens. Therefore, if the wolf was not in the den, we can infer that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes"
