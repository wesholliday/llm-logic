Modus tollens states that if the consequent (the \"then\" part) of a conditional statement is false, then the antecedent (the \"if\" part) must also be false. In this case, the consequent \"the truck was metal\" is false, so the antecedent \"the doll was plastic\" must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes"
