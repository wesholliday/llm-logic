Modus tollens states that if a conditional statement (\"If P, then Q\") is true, and the negation of the consequent (\"Q is not true\") is also true, then the negation of the antecedent (\"P is not true\") must be true. In this case, if \"the truck was blue\" is not true, then \"the car was red\" cannot be true either.\n\nAnswer: yes"
