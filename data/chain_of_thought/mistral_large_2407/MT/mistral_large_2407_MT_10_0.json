(This can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the dog was inside\" and Q is \"the cat was outside.\")\n2. The cat was not outside. (This is \u00acQ, the negation of Q.)\n\nWe want to know if we can infer \"The dog was inside\" (P).\n\nAccording to the first statement, if P is true, then Q must be true. But we know from the second statement that Q is false (\u00acQ is true). Therefore, P cannot be true, because if it were, it would make Q true, which contradicts the second statement. So, we cannot infer that the dog was inside.\n\nAnswer: no"
