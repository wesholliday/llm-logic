            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' implies that if Sam took a plane, it is a necessity that Erin took a train. However, we are given that 'Erin did not take a train'. This contradicts the consequence of Sam taking a plane. Therefore, since Erin did not take a train, it must be the case that Sam did not take a plane, as the initial condition states that if Sam did, then Erin would have taken a train.\n\nAnswer: yes"
