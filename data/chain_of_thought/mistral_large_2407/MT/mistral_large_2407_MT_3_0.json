(If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.)\n2. Not-Q. (The book is not a mystery novel.)\n3. Therefore, not-P. (The book was not written by James.)\n\nIn this case, if the book being written by James implies it is a mystery novel, and we know it is not a mystery novel, then it logically follows that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes"
