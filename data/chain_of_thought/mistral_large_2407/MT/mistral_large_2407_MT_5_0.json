            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" and \"Amy did not play tennis.\" The first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\" The second statement is the negation of Q.\n\nIn logic, if we have \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false, then we can conclude that P is also false. This is known as modus tollens, a valid form of argument.\n\nTherefore, if Amy did not play tennis (Q is false), then Jeff did not play basketball (P is false).\n\nAnswer: yes"
