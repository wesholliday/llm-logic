            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a conditional (if P, then Q) and a negation (not Q). The first statement is \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter,\" which can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the alien visited Mars\" and Q is \"the robot visited Jupiter.\" The second statement is \"The robot did not visit Jupiter,\" which is \u00acQ.\n\nIn logic, if we have P \u2192 Q and we know that \u00acQ is true, then we can infer that \u00acP is also true. This is known as modus tollens. In this case, if the robot did not visit Jupiter (\u00acQ), then it cannot be true that the alien visited Mars (P), because according to the first statement, if the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter. Therefore, we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars (\u00acP).\n\nAnswer: yes"
