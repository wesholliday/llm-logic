            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" and \"Jen did not watch basketball.\" The first statement is a conditional, meaning that if the condition (Tom watched football) is true, then the consequence (Jen watched basketball) must also be true. However, we are told that the consequence is false (Jen did not watch basketball). Therefore, for the conditional statement to hold, the condition must also be false (Tom did not watch football). This is an application of modus tollens in logic.\n\nAnswer: yes"
