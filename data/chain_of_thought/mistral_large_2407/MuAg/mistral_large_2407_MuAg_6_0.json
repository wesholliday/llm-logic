            "content": "Explanation: The original statement uses \"must have\" for both conditions (\"The concert must have been sold out\" and \"it must have started at 8 PM\"), indicating a strong degree of certainty or necessity for both. When we change the sentence to \"The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM\", we are combining these two conditions, but the degree of certainty remains the same for both parts. Therefore, the inference is valid because the meaning and the level of certainty have not changed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
