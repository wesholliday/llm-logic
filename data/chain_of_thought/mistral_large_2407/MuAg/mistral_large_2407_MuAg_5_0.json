            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package must have been delivered today and it must have been signed for\" uses the phrase \"must have been\" for both parts, indicating a strong inference or certainty about two past events. The second statement \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for\" also implies the same two past events, but combines them in a slightly different linguistic structure. The meaning remains essentially the same: the package was delivered today and it was signed for. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
