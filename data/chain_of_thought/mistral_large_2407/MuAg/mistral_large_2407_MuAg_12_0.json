            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday and it must have been under budget\" uses the repetition of \"it must have been\" to indicate two separate conditions that need to be fulfilled: completion by Friday and being under budget. When we consider the inferred statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday and been under budget,\" we are essentially combining these two conditions under a single \"must have been.\" This combination does not change the meaning or the requirements; it simply consolidates them into a more concise form. Therefore, the inferred statement maintains the same logical requirements as the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
