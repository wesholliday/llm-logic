            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The event must have been formal and it must have required tickets\" uses the word \"must\" twice, which emphasizes the necessity of both conditions separately. However, when we change the sentence to \"The event must have been formal and required tickets,\" the word \"must\" is only used once and is applied to both conditions together. This change in language does not alter the logical meaning of the sentence. The event still needs to satisfy both conditions: being formal and requiring tickets. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
