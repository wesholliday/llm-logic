            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The envelope must be upstairs and it must be under a bed\" uses the word \"and\" to connect two conditions that both must be true. The phrase \"it must be\" is repeated, emphasizing that each condition is necessary. When we consider the inferred statement \"The envelope must be upstairs and under a bed,\" we are combining these conditions into a single clause. However, the meaning remains the same because the \"and\" still indicates that both conditions must be met simultaneously. Therefore, the inferred statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
