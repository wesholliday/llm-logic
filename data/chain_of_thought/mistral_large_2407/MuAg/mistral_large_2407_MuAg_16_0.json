            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence uses the modal verb \"must have\" in both clauses to express certainty about past actions. In the second sentence, the modal verb \"must have\" is only used for the first clause (\"The room must have been cleaned daily\"), while it is omitted in the second clause (\"had fresh towels\"). This omission changes the meaning of the second clause, as it no longer expresses the same level of certainty about the past action. Therefore, the two sentences are not interchangeable, and we cannot infer the second sentence from the first.\n\nAnswer: no"
