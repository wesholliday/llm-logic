The only difference is in the phrasing, where the second statement combines the two conditions into a single sentence. Both statements assert the same two conditions about the book: that it must be on the shelf and that it must have a red cover. Therefore, if the first statement is true, the second statement must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
