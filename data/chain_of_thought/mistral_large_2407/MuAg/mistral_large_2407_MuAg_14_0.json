            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The contract must have been valid for a year and it must have been renewable\" contains two conditions:\n1. The contract must have been valid for a year.\n2. The contract must have been renewable.\n\nThe second statement \"The contract must have been valid for a year and been renewable\" also contains the same two conditions, just phrased differently. The use of \"and\" in both statements indicates that both conditions must be true simultaneously. Therefore, the meaning of the statement has not changed, and we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
