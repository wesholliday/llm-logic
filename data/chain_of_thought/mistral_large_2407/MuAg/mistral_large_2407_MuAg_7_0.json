            "content": "Explanation: The original statement uses \"must have\" for both conditions (\"The exam must have been difficult\" and \"it must have covered all chapters\"), indicating a strong degree of certainty or necessity for both. The inferred statement also uses \"must have\" for the first condition (\"The exam must have been difficult\") but uses \"covered\" for the second condition, which could imply a statement of fact rather than a degree of certainty or necessity. However, in practical interpretation, if the exam indeed covered all chapters, then saying \"it must have covered all chapters\" or \"it covered all chapters\" doesn't change the factual content, just the emphasis on certainty. Therefore, the inference is logically valid because the second part can be seen as a factual statement derived from the original certainty.\n\nAnswer: yes"
