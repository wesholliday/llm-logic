            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The document must have been signed and it must have been notarized\" uses the word \"and\" to connect two conditions that both need to be true. This means that for the document to be valid, it must have undergone both actions: signing and notarization. When we consider the phrase \"The document must have been signed and notarized,\" it also implies that both actions have been taken on the document. The use of \"and\" in both statements indicates that both conditions need to be met, so the meanings of the two statements are the same.\n\nAnswer: yes"
