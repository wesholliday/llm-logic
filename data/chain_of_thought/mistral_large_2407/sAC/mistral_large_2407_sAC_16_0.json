            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\". In this case, P is \"the shirt was cotton\", and Q is \"the pants were denim\". We are given that Q is true (\"The pants were denim\" is true). However, in a conditional statement, the truth of Q does not necessarily imply the truth of P. In other words, just because the pants were denim does not mean that the shirt was definitely cotton. The shirt could be made of another material, and the statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" would still be true.\n\nAnswer: no"
