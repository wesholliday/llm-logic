            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true. However, it does not imply that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary must have been there as well. In other words, Sue being at the wedding is a necessary condition for Mary being at the wedding, but it is not a sufficient condition. Therefore, knowing that Sue was at the wedding does not guarantee that Mary was there.\n\nAnswer: no"
