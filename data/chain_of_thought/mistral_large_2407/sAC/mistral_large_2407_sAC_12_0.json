However, it does not imply that if Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe must have gone to the park. In other words, the truth of the second part does not guarantee the truth of the first part. Therefore, knowing that Lucy went to the zoo does not necessarily mean that Joe went to the park.\n\nAnswer: no"
