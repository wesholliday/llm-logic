Here, P is 'Alex finished the race', and Q is 'Chris finished the race'. According to the given information, Q is true. However, the truth of Q does not necessarily imply the truth of P in a conditional statement. In other words, just because Chris finished the race, it does not mean that Alex must have finished the race. The conditional statement only tells us that if Alex did finish, then Chris did as well. It does not provide information in the reverse direction.\n\nAnswer: no"
