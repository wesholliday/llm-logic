            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q.\" In this case, P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" We are given that Q is true (\"Mark bought the blue shirt\"). However, the truth of Q does not necessarily imply the truth of P. In other words, just because Mark bought the blue shirt, we cannot conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt. The original statement only tells us what happens if Lisa buys the red shirt; it does not tell us what happens if Mark buys the blue shirt. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce that Lisa bought the red shirt based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no"
