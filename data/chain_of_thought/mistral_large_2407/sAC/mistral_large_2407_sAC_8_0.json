            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' is a conditional statement of the form 'If P, then Q'. According to the rules of logic, if 'If P, then Q' is true and 'Q' is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that 'P' is true. This is because 'Q' could be true independently of 'P'. In other words, the mummy could be awake for reasons other than the vampire being awake. Therefore, we cannot conclude that 'The vampire was awake' is true based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no"
