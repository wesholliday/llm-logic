The first statement, \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel,\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q.\" The second statement asserts that \"Q\" is true, namely that \"The book is a mystery novel.\" However, knowing that \"Q\" is true does not necessarily imply that \"P\" (The book was written by James) is true. This is because there could be other authors who also write mystery novels. In logical terms, affirming the consequent (Q) does not prove the antecedent (P).\n\nAnswer: no"
