It does not exclude the possibility that the frazzle could be just frazzle. In logical terms, if a statement \"P or Q\" is true, it means at least one of P or Q is true. Therefore, if \"The frazzle must be frazzle or gribble\" is true, it is possible that \"The frazzle must be frazzle\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
