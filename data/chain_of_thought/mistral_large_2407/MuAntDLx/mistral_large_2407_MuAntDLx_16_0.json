However, without additional information, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The frazzle must be quibble flump\" is true on its own. The disjunction allows for the possibility that \"The frazzle must be flimble frozz\" instead. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The frazzle must be quibble flump\" from the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
