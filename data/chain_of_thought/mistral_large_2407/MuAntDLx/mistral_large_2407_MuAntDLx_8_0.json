However, we cannot infer from this statement alone that \"The wump must be quank on zibber\" because it is possible that the wump is only \"wobble for quank quork\" and not \"quank on zibber.\" The disjunction does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the wump must be quank on zibber.\n\nAnswer: no"
