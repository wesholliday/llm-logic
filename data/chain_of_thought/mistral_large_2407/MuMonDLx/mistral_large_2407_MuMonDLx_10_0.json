            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The frazzle must be froodle\" is a specific assertion that the frazzle has to be froodle. When we consider the statement \"The frazzle must be froodle or wobble,\" this is a broader statement that includes the possibility of the frazzle being froodle or wobble. Logically, if the frazzle must be froodle, then it satisfies the condition of being either froodle or wobble because froodle is one of the options in the broader statement. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
