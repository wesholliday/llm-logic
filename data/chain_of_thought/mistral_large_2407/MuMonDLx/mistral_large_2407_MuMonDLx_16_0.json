This is known as the principle of disjunction introduction. In this case, \"The frazzle must be crunk zump\" is the statement \"P\". Therefore, we can infer \"The frazzle must be crunk zump or flibbit floob\" (which is \"P or Q\") regardless of the truth value of \"flibbit floob\" (Q).\n\nAnswer: yes"
