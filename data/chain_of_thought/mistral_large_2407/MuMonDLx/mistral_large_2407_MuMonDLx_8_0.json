The statement \"The grazzle must be snork on zibble or wump wump wozzle\" is a more general claim, as it includes the first statement as one of its possibilities. In logic, if a specific claim is true, then a more general claim that includes the specific claim is also true. Therefore, if \"The grazzle must be snork on zibble\" is true, then \"The grazzle must be snork on zibble or wump wump wozzle\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
