This is known as the principle of disjunction introduction. In this case, the statement \"The crunk must be zooble zibber grooble\" is P. Therefore, \"The crunk must be zooble zibber grooble or blimple blurble flibbit\" is \"P or Q\". Since P is given as true, \"P or Q\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
