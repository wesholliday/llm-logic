When we consider the statement \"The wump must be on the plimp or in the quank,\" this is a more general statement that includes the possibility of the wump being on the plimp. Logically, if the wump must be on the plimp, then it is also true that the wump must be either on the plimp or in the quank, because the first condition (being on the plimp) is already satisfied.\n\nAnswer: yes"
