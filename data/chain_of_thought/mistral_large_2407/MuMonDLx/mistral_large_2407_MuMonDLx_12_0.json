This is known as the principle of disjunction introduction. In this case, \"The floob must be zibble by glorp\" is the statement P. Therefore, \"The floob must be zibble by glorp or wozzle flimble\" is the statement \"P or Q\". Since we know P is true (given), then \"P or Q\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
