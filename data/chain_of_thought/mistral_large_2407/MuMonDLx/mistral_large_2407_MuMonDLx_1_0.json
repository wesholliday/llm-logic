            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The floob must be snizzle a quank\" is a specific assertion. When we consider the statement \"The floob must be snizzle a quank or wobble,\" we are introducing an additional possibility with the use of \"or.\" In logic, if a specific condition is true, then that condition combined with an \"or\" statement that includes the specific condition is also true. This is because the \"or\" statement covers a broader range of possibilities, one of which is already confirmed by the original statement. Therefore, if \"The floob must be snizzle a quank\" is true, then \"The floob must be snizzle a quank or wobble\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
