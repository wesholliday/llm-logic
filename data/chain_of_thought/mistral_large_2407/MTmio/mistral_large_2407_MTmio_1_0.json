            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step.\n\n1. We are given that \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This statement can be written logically as \"Mary at wedding \u2192 Sue at wedding.\"\n\n2. We are also given that \"Sue might not have been at the wedding.\" This means that the statement \"Sue at wedding\" is not necessarily true.\n\n3. If Sue might not have been at the wedding, then the condition \"Sue at wedding\" is not satisfied.\n\n4. Since \"Mary at wedding \u2192 Sue at wedding\" is true, and \"Sue at wedding\" is not necessarily true, we cannot definitively say that Mary was at the wedding. However, we also cannot definitively say that Mary was not at the wedding based solely on these statements. The possibility that Mary was not at the wedding is one interpretation, but it is not a certain inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
