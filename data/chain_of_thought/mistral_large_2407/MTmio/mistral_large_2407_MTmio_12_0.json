We have the statement \"Lucy might not have gone to the zoo.\" This implies that it's possible Lucy didn't go to the zoo, but it's not certain.\n2. The second statement is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" This is a conditional statement, meaning if the first part (Joe went to the park) is true, then the second part (Lucy went to the zoo) must also be true.\n3. Now, if Joe had gone to the park, according to the second statement, Lucy would have definitely gone to the zoo. But we know from the first statement that it's possible Lucy didn't go to the zoo.\n4. Therefore, to accommodate the possibility that Lucy didn't go to the zoo, Joe must not have gone to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes"
