We are given two statements:\n\n1. \"Bob might not have chosen pasta.\"\n2. \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\"\n\nFrom the second statement, we can infer that if Sue chose pizza, then it is a necessity that Bob chose pasta. However, the first statement tells us that Bob might not have chosen pasta, which means there is a possibility that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nIf Bob did not choose pasta, then according to the second statement, Sue could not have chosen pizza because that would require Bob to have chosen pasta. Therefore, the possibility that Bob did not choose pasta implies that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes"
