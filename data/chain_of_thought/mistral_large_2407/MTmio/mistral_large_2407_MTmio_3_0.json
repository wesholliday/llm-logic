            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step.\n\n1. We are given that the book might not be a mystery novel. This means it's possible that the book is not a mystery novel.\n2. We are also given that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. This is a conditional statement that ties the book being a mystery novel to it being written by James.\n3. If the book was written by James, then according to the second statement, it must be a mystery novel. But this contradicts the first statement, which says the book might not be a mystery novel.\n4. Therefore, to resolve this contradiction, we must conclude that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes"
