We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The mummy might not have been awake.\" This implies that the mummy being awake is not certain; it could be either awake or not awake.\n2. \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\" This is a conditional statement that establishes a dependency between the vampire being awake and the mummy being awake.\n\nTo determine if \"The vampire was not awake\" can be inferred, we need to consider the contrapositive of the second statement, which is logically equivalent: \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\"\n\nGiven that the mummy might not have been awake (from the first statement), and using the contrapositive, we can indeed infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes"
