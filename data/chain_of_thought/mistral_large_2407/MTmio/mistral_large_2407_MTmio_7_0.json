We have two statements:\n\n1. \"Chris might not have finished the race.\" This implies that Chris finishing the race is uncertain; it could go either way.\n2. \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\" This is a conditional statement that ties Alex finishing the race to Chris definitely finishing the race.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities:\n- If Alex finished the race, then according to the second statement, Chris must have finished the race. However, this contradicts the first statement which says Chris might not have finished the race.\n- Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, the only possibility that aligns with both statements is that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes"
