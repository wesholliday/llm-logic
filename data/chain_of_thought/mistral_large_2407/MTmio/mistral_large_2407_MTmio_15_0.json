The second statement is \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\" This is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between Sam taking a plane and Erin taking a train.\n3. If Sam did take a plane, then according to the second statement, Erin must have taken a train. However, this contradicts the first statement that Erin might not have taken a train.\n4. Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, we must conclude that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes"
