We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The banana might not have been yellow.\"\n2. \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (\"the apple was red\") is true, then the conclusion (\"the banana must have been yellow\") must also be true.\n\nNow, if the banana might not have been yellow (as stated in the first statement), then the condition \"the apple was red\" cannot be true, because if it were, the banana would have definitely been yellow according to the second statement. Therefore, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes."
