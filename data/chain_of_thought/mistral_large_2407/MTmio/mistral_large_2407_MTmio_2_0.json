We have the statement \"The unicorn might not have been in the forest.\" This tells us that it's possible the unicorn was not in the forest.\n2. The second statement is \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" This is a conditional statement that tells us if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn definitely was as well.\n3. Now, let's consider if the griffin was in the forest. According to the second statement, this would mean the unicorn must have been in the forest. However, this contradicts the first statement, which says the unicorn might not have been in the forest.\n4. Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, we conclude that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes."
