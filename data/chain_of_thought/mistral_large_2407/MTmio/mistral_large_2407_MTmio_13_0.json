We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The truck might not have been blue.\"\n2. \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional, telling us that if the car was red, then the truck being blue is a certainty. However, the first statement tells us that the truck might not have been blue, which introduces doubt about the truck's color.\n\nIf the car was red, according to the second statement, there would be no doubt about the truck's color\u2014it would have to be blue. But since there is doubt (from the first statement), we can conclude that the car could not have been red, because if it were, there would be no doubt about the truck's color.\n\nAnswer: yes."
