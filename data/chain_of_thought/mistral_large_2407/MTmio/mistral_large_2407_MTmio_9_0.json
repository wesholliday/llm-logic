            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step.\n\n1. We are given that \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\" This statement implies that there is a possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, but it does not confirm it.\n2. The second statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt.\n3. To determine if we can infer \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt,\" we need to consider the contrapositive of the second statement. The contrapositive of \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" is \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n4. Since we know there is a possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, according to the contrapositive, this would imply that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes"
