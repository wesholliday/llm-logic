We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The truck might not have been metal.\"\n2. \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\"\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The doll was not plastic\" from these statements.\n\nThe second statement tells us that if the doll was plastic, then the truck being metal is a certainty, not a possibility. However, the first statement suggests that the truck might not have been metal, which contradicts the certainty required by the second statement if the doll was indeed plastic.\n\nTherefore, since the truck might not have been metal, the doll could not have been plastic, because if it were, the truck would have had to be metal without any doubt.\n\nAnswer: yes."
