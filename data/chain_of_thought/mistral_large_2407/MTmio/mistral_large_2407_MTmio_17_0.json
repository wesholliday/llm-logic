We have the statement \"Kate might not have eaten salad.\" This implies that there is a possibility that Kate did not eat salad.\n2. The second statement is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\" This is a conditional statement that tells us if Ben ate pasta, then it is certain that Kate ate salad.\n3. Now, let's combine these two statements. If Kate might not have eaten salad, then according to the second statement, Ben could not have eaten pasta. Because if Ben had eaten pasta, it would be certain that Kate ate salad, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nTherefore, based on these two statements, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes"
