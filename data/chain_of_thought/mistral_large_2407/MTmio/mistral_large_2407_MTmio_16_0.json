If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that \"The shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants being denim is a certainty, not a possibility. However, the first statement tells us that the pants might not have been denim, which contradicts the certainty established by the second statement if the shirt was indeed cotton.\n\nTherefore, since the pants might not have been denim, the only way this doesn't contradict the second statement is if the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes."
