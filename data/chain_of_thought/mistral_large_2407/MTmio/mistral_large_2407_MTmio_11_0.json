We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The muffins might not have been blueberry.\"\n2. \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (the cake was chocolate) is true, then the conclusion (the muffins must have been blueberry) must also be true.\n\nHowever, the first statement tells us that it's possible the muffins were not blueberry. If the muffins were not blueberry, then according to the second statement, the cake could not have been chocolate (because if the cake were chocolate, the muffins would have had to be blueberry).\n\nSo, if the muffins might not have been blueberry, then the cake must not have been chocolate to avoid contradicting the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes."
