The first statement is a disjunction: \"Either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked.\" This means that at least one of these conditions must be true. The second statement is \"The twonk might not be plinked,\" which introduces a possibility but does not confirm that the twonk is not plinked. However, if we assume that the twonk is not plinked, then according to the first statement, the only remaining option is that the twonk is varnished. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes"
