The first statement is a disjunction: \"Either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned.\" This means that at least one of these conditions must be true. The second statement is \"The fleeg might not be surned,\" which introduces a possibility but does not confirm that the fleeg is not surned. However, if we assume that the fleeg is not surned, then according to the first statement, the only remaining option is that the fleeg is bluttered. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes"
