The first statement is a disjunction: \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked.\" This means that at least one of these conditions must be true.\n2. The second statement is \"The splat might not be quanked.\" This introduces a possibility that the splat is not quanked.\n3. If the splat is not quanked, then according to the first statement, the only remaining option is that the splat is morphed.\n4. Therefore, if the splat might not be quanked, it follows that the splat is morphed to satisfy the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
