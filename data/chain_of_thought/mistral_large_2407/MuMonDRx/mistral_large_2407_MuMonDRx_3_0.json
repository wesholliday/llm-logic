The statement \"The floob must be on the zibble or in the froodle\" includes the original location (in the froodle) as one of two possible locations. Logically, if the floob must be in the froodle, then it is also true that the floob must be either on the zibble or in the froodle, because the second statement includes the first as a possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes"
