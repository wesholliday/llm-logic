            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The grazzle must be wumble\" is a specific assertion about the condition of the grazzle. When we consider the statement \"The grazzle must be frazzle or wumble,\" this is a broader statement that includes the possibility of the grazzle being either frazzle or wumble. Since the original statement specifies that the grazzle must be wumble, it is included within the broader statement that the grazzle could be either frazzle or wumble. Therefore, the inference is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
