The premise is a negation (\"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James\"), and the conclusion is a possibility (\"The book might not have been written by James\"). In logical terms, if we denote \"the book was written by James\" as P, the premise is \u00acP (not P), and the conclusion is \u25ca\u00acP (possibly not P). The argument is valid because if it's not the case that P is true, then it's logically possible that P is not true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
