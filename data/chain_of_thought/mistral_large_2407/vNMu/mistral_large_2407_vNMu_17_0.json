The premise is \"It's not the case that the scarf must be stuffed in my backpack.\" This can be rephrased as \"It is not necessary that the scarf is in my backpack.\" The conclusion is \"The scarf might not be stuffed in my backpack,\" which means \"It is possible that the scarf is not in my backpack.\" The premise and the conclusion are logically consistent because if it's not necessarily true that the scarf is in the backpack, then it is indeed possible that the scarf is not in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes."
