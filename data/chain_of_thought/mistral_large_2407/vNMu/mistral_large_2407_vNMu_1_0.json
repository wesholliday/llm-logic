            "content": "Explanation: The argument presented is in the form of denying a necessity (the premise) and concluding a possibility (the conclusion). In modal logic, the statement \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" can be interpreted as \"It is not necessary that Mary was at the wedding,\" which implies that there exists a possibility where Mary was not at the wedding. This aligns with the conclusion \"Mary might not have been at the wedding,\" which asserts that it is possible that Mary was not at the wedding. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes"
