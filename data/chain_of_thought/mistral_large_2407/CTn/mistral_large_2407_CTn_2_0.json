            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then not Q,\" where P is \"the griffin was in the forest\" and Q is \"the unicorn was in the forest.\" The question asks if we can infer the statement \"If Q, then not P.\" To determine this, we can use the concept of contraposition. The contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then not Q\" is \"If Q, then not P,\" which is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
