            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a form of conditional statement, \"If P, then not Q\" (where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo\"). The question asks if we can infer the statement \"If Q, then not P\". These two statements are logically equivalent. This is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are always either both true or both false. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the inferred statement must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
