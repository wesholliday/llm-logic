            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen did not watch basketball.\" The question asks if we can infer the statement \"If not-Q, then not-P,\" which is \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\" According to the rules of logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement (If not-Q, then not-P) is always logically equivalent to the original statement (If P, then Q). Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
