            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins were not blueberry\". The question asks if we can infer the statement \"If not Q, then not P\", which is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning if one is true, the other must also be true. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the inferred statement \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
