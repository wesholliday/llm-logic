            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then not Q\" (where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim\"). The question asks if we can infer the statement \"If Q, then not P.\" These two statements are logically equivalent because they are contrapositives of each other. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are always logically equivalent. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the inferred statement must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
