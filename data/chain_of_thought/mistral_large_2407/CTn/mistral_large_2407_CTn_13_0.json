            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is \"If the car was red, then the truck was not blue,\" which can be written in logical terms as P \u2192 \u00acQ, where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\" We are asked if we can infer \"If the truck was blue, then the car was not red,\" which can be written as Q \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of P \u2192 \u00acQ is Q \u2192 \u00acP. This means that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nTherefore, if \"If the car was red, then the truck was not blue\" is true, then \"If the truck was blue, then the car was not red\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
