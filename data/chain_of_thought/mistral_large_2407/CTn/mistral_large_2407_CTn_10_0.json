            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was not outside.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the dog was inside\" and Q is \"the cat was not outside.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside.\" This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" So, the contrapositive of \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was not outside\" is indeed \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside.\"\n\nTherefore, we can validly infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
