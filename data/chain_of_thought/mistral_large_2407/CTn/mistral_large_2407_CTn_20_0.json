            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was not yellow\". The question asks if we can infer the statement \"If Q is false, then P is false\". This is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are always logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if \"If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow\" is true, then \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
