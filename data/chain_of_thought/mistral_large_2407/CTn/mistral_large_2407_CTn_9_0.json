            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a form of conditional statement (if P, then Q), where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\" In logic, a conditional statement is equivalent to its contrapositive (if not-Q, then not-P). The contrapositive of the given statement is \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" Therefore, we can indeed infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
