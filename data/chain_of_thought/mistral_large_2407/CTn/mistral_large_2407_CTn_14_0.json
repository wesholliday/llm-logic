            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the bear was in the cave\" and Q is \"the wolf was not in the den\". The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P\". In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if one is true, the other must also be true. Therefore, if \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den\" is true, then \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
