            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was not at the wedding\". The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of the statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P\", or in this case, \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\". In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if one is true, the other must also be true. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the inferred statement must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
