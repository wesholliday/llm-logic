            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy did not play tennis\". The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P\", or \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\". In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if one is true, the other must also be true. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the inferred statement must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
