The contrapositive of P \u2192 \u00acQ is Q \u2192 \u00acP. This means that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nTherefore, if \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was not awake\" is true, then \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
