            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was not metal,\" which can be written as \"Doll is plastic \u2192 Truck is not metal.\" In logic, this is equivalent to \"Truck is metal \u2192 Doll is not plastic.\" This is because the contrapositive of a statement (which is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then switching their places) is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
