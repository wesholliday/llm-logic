The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is always logically equivalent to the original statement and is of the form \"If not Q, then not P\". In this case, the contrapositive is \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
