            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The gronk might be in frozz or zibber\" suggests that there are two possible locations for the gronk: frozz or zibber. The phrase \"or\" in this context implies that the gronk could be in one of the two places, not necessarily both. When we rephrase it to \"The gronk might be in frozz or it might be zibber,\" we are essentially breaking down the original statement into two separate possibilities, which maintains the same meaning as the original statement. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
