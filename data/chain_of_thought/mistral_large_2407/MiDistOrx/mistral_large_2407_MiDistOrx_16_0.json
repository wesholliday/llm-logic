            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence \"The snorkel might be flibbit wibble or flump wibble\" uses the word \"or\" to connect two possibilities. This structure implies that either of the two conditions can be true. When we rephrase it to \"The snorkel might be flibbit wibble or it might be flump wibble,\" we are simply expanding the sentence to explicitly state each possibility separately. The meaning remains the same, as the word \"or\" still indicates that either condition could be true. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
