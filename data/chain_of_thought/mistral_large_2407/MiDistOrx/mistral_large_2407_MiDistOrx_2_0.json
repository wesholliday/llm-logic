            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence \"The wibble might be on the zizz or in the snizzle\" presents two possibilities for the location of the wibble. The phrase \"or\" in this context suggests that one or the other could be true. When we rephrase it to \"The wibble might be on the zizz or it might be in the snizzle,\" we are simply breaking down the original sentence into two separate possibilities, which maintains the same meaning. Therefore, the rephrased sentence can be inferred from the original sentence.\n\nAnswer: yes"
