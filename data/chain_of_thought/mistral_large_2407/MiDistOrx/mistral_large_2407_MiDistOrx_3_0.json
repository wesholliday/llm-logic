            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The snork might be in the wibble or on the quank\" suggests that there are two possible locations for the snork: \"in the wibble\" or \"on the quank\". The phrase \"might be\" indicates possibility, and the use of \"or\" implies that either or both of these possibilities could be true. When we rephrase this as \"The snork might be in the wibble or it might be on the quank\", we are essentially breaking down the original statement into two separate possibilities using the same \"might be\" phrasing. This rephrasing does not change the meaning or the implications of the original statement; it simply presents the same information in a slightly different format. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
