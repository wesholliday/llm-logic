            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is an example of a conditional statement in logic, which can be written as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the wug was sproinged\" and Q is \"the wug was garpled.\" The question asks if we can infer the inverse of this statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P.\" According to the rules of logical equivalence, the inverse of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if \"If P, then Q\" is true, then \"If not Q, then not P\" is also true. Therefore, if \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" is true, then \"If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
