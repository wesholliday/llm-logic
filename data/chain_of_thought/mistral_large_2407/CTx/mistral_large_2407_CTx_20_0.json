            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the fleeg was bluttered\" and Q is \"it surned.\" The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is always logically equivalent to the original statement and is of the form \"If not Q, then not P.\" Therefore, the contrapositive of \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" is \"If the fleeg did not surn, then the fleeg was not bluttered.\" Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
