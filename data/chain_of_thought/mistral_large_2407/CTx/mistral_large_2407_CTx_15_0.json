            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and Q is \"the dreb was spened.\" In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" Therefore, the contrapositive of \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\" is \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed.\" Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
