            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is an example of a conditional statement in logic, which can be written in the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the grommet was sploffed\" and Q is \"the grommet plopped the frink.\" The question asks whether we can infer the inverse of this statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P.\" In logical reasoning, the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. However, the contrapositive of a conditional statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P,\" is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, if \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" is true, then \"If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
