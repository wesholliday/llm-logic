            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is an example of a conditional statement in logic, which can be written in the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the smip was shripped\" and Q is \"the smip lupped the zoint.\" The question asks whether we can infer the inverse of this statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P,\" or \"If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped.\" According to the rules of logical inference, the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. However, in this case, the inverse also happens to be the contrapositive of the original statement, which is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion of the original statement and then switching their places. So, the contrapositive of \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint\" is \"If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped,\" which is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we can indeed infer the inverse statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
