            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is an example of a conditional statement in logic, which follows the form \"If P, then Q\". The question asks if we can infer the statement \"If not Q, then not P\" from \"If P, then Q\". In logic, these two statements are equivalent and the latter is known as the contrapositive of the former. If the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\" is true, then \"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
