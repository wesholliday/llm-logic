            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is an example of a conditional statement in logic, which can be written as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the whiffle was shanked\" and Q is \"the whiffle tinked\". The question asks if we can infer the inverse of this statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P\". According to the rules of logical inference, the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. However, the contrapositive of a conditional statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P\", is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
