            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the fribble was snurgled\" and Q is \"the fribble crinked.\" The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P,\" or \"If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled.\" In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, we can indeed infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
