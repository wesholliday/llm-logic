            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the flug was blummed\" and Q is \"the flug was zimmed.\" The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" In this case, that would be \"If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed.\" A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning if one is true, the other is also true. Therefore, we can indeed infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
