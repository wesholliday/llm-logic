            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the flugel was blimmed\" and Q is \"the flugel was zargled.\" The question asks if we can infer the statement \"If not Q, then not P,\" which is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled\" is true, then \"If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
