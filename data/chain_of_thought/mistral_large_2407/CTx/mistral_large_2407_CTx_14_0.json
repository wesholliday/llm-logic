            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\". The question asks if we can infer \"If the clug did not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked\", which is of the form \"If not Q, then not P\". This is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are always logically equivalent, meaning if one is true, the other must also be true. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the inference \"If the clug did not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
