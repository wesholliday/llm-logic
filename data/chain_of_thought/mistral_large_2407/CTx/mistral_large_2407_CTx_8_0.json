            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is an example of a conditional statement in logic, which follows the form \"If P, then Q.\" The question asks whether we can infer the inverse of this statement, \"If not Q, then not P.\" In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement is not always true. However, in this case, the inverse also happens to be the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then switching their places. So, the contrapositive of \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" is \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\" Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed make this inference.\n\nAnswer: yes"
