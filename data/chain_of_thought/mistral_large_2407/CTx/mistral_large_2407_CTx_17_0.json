            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\". The question asks if we can infer \"If the flob did not movated, then the flob was not skizzled\", which is of the form \"If not Q, then not P\". This is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are always logically equivalent, meaning if one is true, the other must also be true. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the inferred statement is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
