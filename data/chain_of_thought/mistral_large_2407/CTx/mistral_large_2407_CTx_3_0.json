            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is an example of a conditional statement in logic, which can be written as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the splat was morphed\" and Q is \"the splat quanked.\" The question asks if we can infer the inverse of this statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P.\" In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true. However, the contrapositive of a conditional statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P,\" is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, if \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" is true, then \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
