            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\". The question asks if we can infer \"If the smonk did not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled\", which is of the form \"If not Q, then not P\". This is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are always logically equivalent, meaning if one is true, the other must also be true. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the inferred statement is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
