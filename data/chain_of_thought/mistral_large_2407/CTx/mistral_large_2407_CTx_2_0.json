            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is an example of a conditional statement in logic, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the wug was flooped\" and Q is \"the wug bimmed the zoint.\" The question asks if we can infer the statement \"If not Q, then not P,\" which is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, if \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint\" is true, then \"If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
