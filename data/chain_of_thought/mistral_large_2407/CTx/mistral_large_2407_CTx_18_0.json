            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is an example of a conditional statement in logic, which can be written as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the shank was plooked\" and Q is \"the shank was nugged.\" The question asks if we can infer the inverse, \"If not Q, then not P.\" According to the rules of logical equivalence, the inverse of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if \"If P, then Q\" is true, then \"If not Q, then not P\" is also true. Therefore, if \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\" is true, then \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
