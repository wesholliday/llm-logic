The category \"semi-formal or formal\" includes both semi-formal events and formal events. Since a formal event is a subset of \"semi-formal or formal,\" if an event is formal, it necessarily falls within the broader category of \"semi-formal or formal.\" Therefore, if the event must have been formal, it logically follows that it must have been semi-formal or formal.\n\nAnswer: yes"
