            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The keys must be in the drawer' is a specific claim about the location of the keys. The phrase 'The keys must be on the table or in the drawer' includes the possibility that the keys are in the drawer, but also adds an additional possibility that the keys are on the table. Since the original statement does not exclude the possibility that the keys could also be on the table in a broader context, we can logically infer the second statement from the first. This is because if the keys must be in the drawer, then it is also true that they must be either on the table or in the drawer, as the latter statement includes the former as one of its possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes"
