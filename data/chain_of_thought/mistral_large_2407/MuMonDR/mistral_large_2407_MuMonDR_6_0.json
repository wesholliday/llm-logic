            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The concert must have been sold out\" provides a specific condition about the concert. The phrase \"postponed or sold out\" includes the condition \"sold out\" as one of its possibilities. Therefore, if the concert must have been sold out, it logically follows that it must have been either postponed or sold out, since \"sold out\" is one of the options in the latter phrase.\n\nAnswer: yes"
