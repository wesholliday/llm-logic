The phrase \"The meeting must have been cancelled or scheduled for 2 PM\" includes an additional possibility that the meeting was cancelled. Logically, if the meeting was scheduled for 2 PM, it could also be true that it was either cancelled or scheduled for 2 PM, because the original statement is one of the possibilities in the second statement. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
