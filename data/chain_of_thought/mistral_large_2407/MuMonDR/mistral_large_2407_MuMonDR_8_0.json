            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays\" provides specific information about the restaurant's schedule on Mondays. The inference \"The restaurant must have been open for limited hours or closed on Mondays\" includes two possibilities: one is that the restaurant is closed on Mondays, and the other is that it is open for limited hours. Since the original statement confirms that the restaurant is closed on Mondays, it aligns with one of the possibilities presented in the inference. Therefore, the inference is valid because it includes the scenario described in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
