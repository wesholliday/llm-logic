            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday\" implies that the project's completion deadline was Friday. This statement does not mention anything about the project being extended. However, the phrase \"The project must have been extended or completed by Friday\" includes the possibility of the project being extended in addition to the possibility of it being completed by Friday. Since the original statement does not exclude the possibility of an extension (it simply doesn't mention it), it is logically possible that the project could have been either extended or completed by Friday. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
