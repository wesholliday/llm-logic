When we consider the statement \"The flight must have been on time or delayed,\" this covers all possible outcomes for the flight's timeliness\u2014either it was on time or it was delayed. Since being delayed is one of the outcomes covered by \"on time or delayed,\" the original statement that the flight must have been delayed is included within the broader statement.
