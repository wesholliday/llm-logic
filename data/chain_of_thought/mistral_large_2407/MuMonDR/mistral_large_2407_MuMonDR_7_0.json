When we consider the statement \"The exam must have been easy or difficult,\" it covers both possibilities of the exam's difficulty. Logically, if the exam must have been difficult, then it necessarily falls under the broader category of being either easy or difficult. Therefore, the inference is valid because the specific case (difficult) is included in the broader case (easy or difficult).\n\nAnswer: yes"
