            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The room must have been cleaned daily\" indicates a regular, scheduled cleaning routine. The phrase \"upon request\" suggests an optional or additional cleaning that is not part of the regular schedule. Therefore, if the room is already being cleaned daily as a standard procedure, it can also be cleaned upon request, as this would simply be an additional instance of cleaning. Hence, the inference \"The room must have been cleaned upon request or daily\" is valid because it includes the original daily cleaning schedule with the option of additional cleanings upon request.\n\nAnswer: yes"
