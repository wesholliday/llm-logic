            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document must have been signed\" indicates that the only condition we know for certain is that the document has been signed. The phrase \"must have been\" implies necessity or certainty about the signing. However, it does not provide any information about whether the document was notarized. The term \"notarized\" refers to a specific legal process that is not inherently included in the act of signing. Therefore, we cannot infer that the document must have been notarized just because it was signed. The statement \"The document must have been notarized or signed\" suggests that either notarization or signing would satisfy the condition, but since we only know that the document was signed, we cannot conclude that it was also notarized.\n\nAnswer: no"
