            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package must have been delivered today\" specifies a definite time frame for the delivery, which is today. The phrase \"must have been\" indicates a strong certainty about the event happening in the past, relative to the current day. When considering the statement \"The package must have been delivered tomorrow or today,\" we introduce an additional possibility of the package being delivered in the future (tomorrow). However, since the original statement confirms the delivery has already occurred today, it logically follows that the package was indeed delivered either today or at some future point (tomorrow), even though we know it was today. Therefore, the inference is valid because it includes the confirmed delivery time (today) as one of the options.\n\nAnswer: yes"
