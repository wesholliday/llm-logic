            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The book must be on the shelf\" is a specific claim about the book's location. The second statement \"The book must be in the library or on the shelf\" introduces an additional possibility, namely that the book could be in the library. Since the original statement does not exclude the possibility that the shelf is in the library, we can indeed infer the second statement from the first. This is because if the book is on the shelf, it satisfies the condition of being either in the library or on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes"
