            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The envelope must be under a bed\" specifies a single location where the envelope can be. The second statement \"The envelope must be upstairs or under a bed\" introduces an additional location (\"upstairs\") where the envelope could potentially be. Since the original statement does not exclude the possibility that the envelope could be upstairs (it simply doesn't mention it), it is logically valid to infer that the envelope could be either upstairs or under a bed. In other words, the second statement is a broader claim that includes the possibility stated in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
