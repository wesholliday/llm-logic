            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down logically. The first statement is a conditional: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This means that if Mary's presence at the wedding is true, then Sue's presence is also true. The second statement is \"Sue might not have been at the wedding,\" which introduces doubt about Sue's presence. However, it doesn't provide any definitive information about Mary.\n\nThe key here is that the first statement doesn't work backwards. In other words, just because Sue might not have been there, it doesn't mean Mary wasn't there. Mary being at the wedding is a sufficient condition for Sue being there, but it's not a necessary condition. So, we can't infer anything about Mary's presence or absence based on the uncertainty of Sue's presence.\n\nAnswer: no"
