            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down logically. The first statement says that if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside. This can be written as \"If Dog Inside, Then Cat Outside.\" The second statement says that the cat might not have been outside, which means we don't have definitive information about the cat's location. However, if the dog being inside necessitates the cat being outside, and we know the cat might not have been outside, then the dog could not have been inside (because that would require the cat to be outside).\n\nAnswer: yes"
