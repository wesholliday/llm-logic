Chris might not have finished the race.\n\nThe second statement tells us that Chris's completion of the race is uncertain. However, the first statement doesn't tell us anything about whether Alex finished the race or not; it only tells us that if Alex did finish, then Chris must have as well. Since we don't have any information that definitively says Alex finished the race, and we know Chris might not have, we cannot infer that Alex did not finish the race. We simply don't have enough information to make a definitive inference about Alex.\n\nAnswer: no"
