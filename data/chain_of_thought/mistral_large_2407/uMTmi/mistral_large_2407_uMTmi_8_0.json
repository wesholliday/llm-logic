            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down logically. We are given two statements:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\n2. The mummy might not have been awake.\n\nThe second statement introduces doubt about the mummy's state, suggesting it could either be awake or not awake. If we assume the vampire was awake, according to the first statement, the mummy must have been awake. However, this contradicts the possibility presented in the second statement that the mummy might not have been awake. Therefore, to accommodate the possibility that the mummy might not have been awake, we must conclude that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes."
