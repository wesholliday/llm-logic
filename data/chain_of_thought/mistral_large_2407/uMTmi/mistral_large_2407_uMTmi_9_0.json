            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down logically. We are given two statements:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. (This is a conditional statement, which we can write as \"Lisa_Red -> Mark_Blue\")\n2. Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. (This means that \"Mark_Blue\" is not necessarily true)\n\nNow, let's consider if Lisa did buy the red shirt. According to the first statement, this would mean that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. However, the second statement tells us that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, which contradicts the idea that Lisa bought the red shirt. Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes"
