            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the statements given:\n\n1. If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. This is a conditional statement that can be written as \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal.\"\n2. The truck might not have been metal. This statement introduces doubt about Q, suggesting that Q might be false.\n\nNow, let's consider the contrapositive of the first statement, which is logically equivalent: \"If not Q, then not P.\" In other words, \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\"\n\nSince the second statement tells us that the truck might not have been metal (not Q), according to the contrapositive, we can infer that the doll was not plastic (not P).\n\nAnswer: yes"
