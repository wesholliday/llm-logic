            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest. This is a conditional statement that ties the presence of the griffin to the presence of the unicorn.\n2. The unicorn might not have been in the forest. This statement introduces uncertainty about the unicorn's presence in the forest.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not provide definitive information about the griffin. It only tells us that the unicorn's presence is uncertain. Since the first statement does not provide any information about what happens if the unicorn is not in the forest, we cannot infer anything about the griffin's location based solely on the uncertainty of the unicorn's location.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no"
