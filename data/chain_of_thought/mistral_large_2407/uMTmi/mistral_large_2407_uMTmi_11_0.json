The muffins might not have been blueberry.\n\nThe second statement introduces doubt about the muffins being blueberry. If we assume the cake was chocolate, according to the first statement, the muffins must have been blueberry. However, this contradicts the second statement, which allows for the possibility that the muffins were not blueberry. Therefore, to satisfy both statements, we must conclude that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes."
