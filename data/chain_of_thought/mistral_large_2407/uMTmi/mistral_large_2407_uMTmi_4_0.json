The robot might not have visited Jupiter.\n\nThe second statement introduces doubt about the robot visiting Jupiter. According to the first statement, if the alien had visited Mars, then it is certain that the robot would have visited Jupiter. However, since there is uncertainty about the robot's visit to Jupiter, we cannot definitively say that the alien visited Mars. Therefore, it is possible that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes."
