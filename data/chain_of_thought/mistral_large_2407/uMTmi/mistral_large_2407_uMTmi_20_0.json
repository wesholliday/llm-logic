            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down logically. The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" implies that a red apple necessitates a yellow banana. However, the second statement \"the banana might not have been yellow\" introduces uncertainty about the banana's color. If the banana is not yellow, according to the first statement, the apple cannot be red. Therefore, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes"
