            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down logically. The first statement says that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. This is a conditional statement (if A, then B). The second statement says that the truck might not have been blue. This introduces doubt about the truck's color, which contradicts the certainty in the first statement about the truck's color if the car was red. Therefore, since the truck might not have been blue, the car could not have been red, because if it were, the truck would have definitely been blue according to the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
