            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\" and \"Jen might not have watched basketball.\" The first statement is a conditional, meaning that if the condition (Tom watched football) is true, then the consequence (Jen watched basketball) must be true. The second statement introduces doubt about the consequence (Jen might not have watched basketball). If Jen might not have watched basketball, then the condition (Tom watched football) cannot be true, because if it were, Jen would have definitely watched basketball. Therefore, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes"
