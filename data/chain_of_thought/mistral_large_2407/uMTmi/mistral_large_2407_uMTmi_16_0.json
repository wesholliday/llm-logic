            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down logically. The statement gives us two pieces of information:\n\n1. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. This is a conditional statement that can be written as: Cotton Shirt \u2192 Denim Pants.\n2. The pants might not have been denim. This means that it's possible that the pants were not denim.\n\nNow, let's consider the contrapositive of the first statement, which is logically equivalent: Not Denim Pants \u2192 Not Cotton Shirt.\n\nSince the second statement tells us that \"Not Denim Pants\" is a possibility, according to the contrapositive, \"Not Cotton Shirt\" must also be a possibility. Therefore, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes"
