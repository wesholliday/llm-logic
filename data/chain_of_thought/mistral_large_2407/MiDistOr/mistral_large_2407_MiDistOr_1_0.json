            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The envelope might be upstairs or under a bed\" is a simple sentence that presents two possible locations for the envelope. The rephrased statement \"The envelope might be upstairs or it might be under a bed\" breaks down the original sentence into two separate clauses but retains the same meaning. Both sentences are suggesting that there are two possible locations for the envelope, with the use of \"or\" indicating that either one of the locations could be correct. Therefore, the rephrased statement can be inferred from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
