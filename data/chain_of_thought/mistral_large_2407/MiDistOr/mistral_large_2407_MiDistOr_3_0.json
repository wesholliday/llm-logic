            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The keys might be in the drawer or on the table\" suggests two possible locations for the keys, without implying that these are the only two possibilities. When we rephrase it to \"The keys might be in the drawer or they might be on the table,\" we are still preserving the same two possibilities, and not adding or removing any information. Both sentences are expressing the same uncertainty about the location of the keys, so they can be inferred from one another.\n\nAnswer: yes"
