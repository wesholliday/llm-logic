            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The book might be on the shelf or in the library\" suggests two possible locations for the book, with the word \"or\" indicating that either one could be true. When we rephrase it to \"The book might be on the shelf or it might be in the library,\" we are simply breaking down the same possibilities into two separate clauses. The meaning does not change; it's just a more explicit way of expressing the same idea. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
