            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The flight might be delayed or on time\" presents two possibilities: delay or punctuality. The rephrased statement \"The flight might be delayed or it might be on time\" expresses the same two possibilities, just with a slight change in wording for emphasis. The use of \"it might\" in the second statement does not change the inherent meaning or the possibilities presented. Therefore, the second statement can be inferred from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
