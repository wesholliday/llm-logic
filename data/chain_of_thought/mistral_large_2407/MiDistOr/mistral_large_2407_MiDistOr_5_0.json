            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package might be delivered today or tomorrow\" implies that there are two possible days for the delivery: today and tomorrow. By breaking it down into \"The package might be delivered today or it might be delivered tomorrow,\" we are simply expressing the same information in a more explicit manner. The use of \"or\" in the original statement already suggests that either of the two days is a possibility, so the rephrased version doesn't change the meaning.\n\nAnswer: yes"
