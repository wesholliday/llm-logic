It does not explicitly state that these are mutually exclusive options. The rephrased statement \"The document might be signed or it might be notarized\" also allows for the possibility that the document could be either signed, notarized, or both. Therefore, the rephrased statement does not change the meaning of the original statement and can be inferred from it.\n\nAnswer: yes"
