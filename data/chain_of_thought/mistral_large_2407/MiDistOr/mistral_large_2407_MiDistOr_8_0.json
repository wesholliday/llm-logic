            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The restaurant might be closed on Mondays or open for limited hours\" presents two possibilities: one where the restaurant is closed on Mondays, and another where it is open for limited hours. The use of \"or\" in this context suggests that either of these situations could be true. The rephrased statement \"The restaurant might be closed on Mondays or it might be open for limited hours\" maintains the same logical structure and meaning. It also presents the same two possibilities with the same uncertainty, using \"might\" to indicate that either situation could be the case. Therefore, the rephrased statement can be inferred from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
