            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The meeting might start at 2 PM or be cancelled\" implies two possibilities: either the meeting starts at 2 PM or it is cancelled. The rephrased statement \"The meeting might start at 2 PM or it might be cancelled\" expresses the same two possibilities, just with slightly different wording. The use of \"might\" in both cases indicates uncertainty about which of the two outcomes will occur. Therefore, the meaning of the original statement is preserved in the rephrased statement, allowing us to infer the rephrased statement from the original.\n\nAnswer: yes"
