            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The project might be completed by Friday or extended\" implies two possibilities: completion by Friday or an extension. The rephrased statement \"The project might be completed by Friday or it might be extended\" expresses the same two possibilities, just with slightly different wording. The use of \"it might\" in the second statement is simply a more explicit way of expressing the uncertainty already implied by \"might\" in the first statement. Therefore, the meaning remains the same, and the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
