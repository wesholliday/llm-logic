This statement is using the word \"or\" to indicate that either one of the options could be true. When we rephrase it to \"The event might be formal or it might be semi-formal,\" we are essentially breaking down the original statement into two separate possibilities, but the meaning remains the same. Both statements are conveying that the event could be either formal or semi-formal.\n\nAnswer: yes"
