            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The room might be cleaned daily or upon request\" implies two possible scenarios for when the room might be cleaned. By breaking down the sentence, we see that it suggests the room could be cleaned either on a daily basis or when someone requests it. Therefore, rephrasing it to \"The room might be cleaned daily or it might be cleaned upon request\" maintains the same meaning, as it simply expands on the two scenarios presented in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
