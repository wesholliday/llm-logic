We are given two statements:\n\n1. \"Sam did not take a plane.\"\n2. \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (\"Sam took a plane\") is true, then the conclusion (\"Erin took a train\") must also be true. However, we know from the first statement that the condition is false (\"Sam did not take a plane\"). When the condition of a conditional statement is false, the statement as a whole does not provide any information about the conclusion. In other words, because Sam did not take a plane, we cannot infer anything about whether Erin took a train or not from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
