We have two statements:\n\n1. \"Tom did not watch football.\"\n2. \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. If the condition (Tom watched football) is not met, then the conclusion (Jen watched basketball) does not necessarily hold. Since we know that Tom did not watch football, we cannot conclude anything about Jen's actions based on the given information. The statement does not provide any information about what Jen did if Tom did not watch football. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"Jen did not watch basketball.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
