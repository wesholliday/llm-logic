We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The cake was not chocolate.\"\n2. \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (\"the cake was chocolate\") is true, then the conclusion (\"the muffins were blueberry\") is also true. However, the first statement tells us that the condition is not true (\"the cake was not chocolate\").\n\nIn logic, if the condition of a conditional statement is false, we cannot infer anything about the conclusion. The conclusion might be true or false; we don't know. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The muffins were not blueberry\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
