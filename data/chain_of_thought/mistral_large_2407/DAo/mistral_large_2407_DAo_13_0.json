We are also given the implication \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\"\n\nIn logic, if we have an implication \"If P, then Q,\" and we know that P is false, we cannot directly infer anything about Q. This is because the truth of Q is not dependent on P being false. In other words, knowing that the car was not red does not provide any information about the color of the truck based on the given implication.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The truck was not blue\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
