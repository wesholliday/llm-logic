However, the first statement tells us that the condition is false (\"The book was not written by James\"). When the condition of a conditional statement is false, the statement as a whole does not provide any information about the conclusion. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about whether the book is a mystery novel or not based solely on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
