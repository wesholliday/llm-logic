            "content": "Explanation: The given information is that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. The second statement is a conditional: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" Since Lisa did not buy the red shirt, the condition for Mark buying the blue shirt is not met. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Mark bought the blue shirt. However, the statement doesn't give us any information about what happens if Lisa doesn't buy the red shirt. It doesn't tell us that Mark doesn't buy the blue shirt in that case. So, we cannot infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt either. The information is insufficient to make a definite inference about Mark's action.\n\nAnswer: no"
