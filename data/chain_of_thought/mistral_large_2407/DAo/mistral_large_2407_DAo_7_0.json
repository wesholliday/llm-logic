This is a form of conditional statement (if P, then Q). If the condition P (Alex finishing the race) is not met, then we cannot conclude that Q (Chris finishing the race) is true. However, we also cannot definitively conclude that Q is false; Chris might or might not have finished the race based on the given information. The statement does not provide any information about Chris's completion of the race independent of Alex's completion.\n\nAnswer: no"
