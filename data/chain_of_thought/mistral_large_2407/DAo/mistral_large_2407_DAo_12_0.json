The second statement is a conditional: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" Since Joe did not go to the park, the condition for Lucy going to the zoo is not met. However, this does not provide any information about what Lucy did if Joe did not go to the park. Therefore, we cannot infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
