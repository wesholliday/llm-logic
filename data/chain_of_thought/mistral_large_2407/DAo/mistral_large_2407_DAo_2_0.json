            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are \"The griffin was not in the forest\" and \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the griffin being in the forest) is true, then the consequence (the unicorn being in the forest) is also true. However, since we know that the griffin was not in the forest, the condition is false. When the condition of a conditional statement is false, the statement as a whole does not provide any information about the consequence. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the unicorn's location based solely on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
