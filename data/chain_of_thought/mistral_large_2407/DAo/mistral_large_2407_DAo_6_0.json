We are given two statements:\n\n1. \"Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n2. \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (\"Sue chose pizza\") is true, then the conclusion (\"Bob chose pasta\") is also true. However, if the condition is false, the conditional statement doesn't tell us anything about the conclusion.\n\nSince we know that \"Sue did not choose pizza,\" the condition is false. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about whether Bob chose pasta or not from the given information. The statement \"Bob did not choose pasta\" could be true or false; we simply don't have enough information to determine this.\n\nAnswer: no"
