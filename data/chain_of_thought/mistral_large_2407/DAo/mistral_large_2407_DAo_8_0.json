We also know that \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (\"the vampire was awake\") is true, then the conclusion (\"the mummy was awake\") is also true.\n3. However, since we know that the vampire was not awake, the condition is false. When the condition of a conditional statement is false, the statement doesn't tell us anything about the conclusion.\n4. But, we can look at the contrapositive of the given conditional statement, which is \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\" This statement is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement.\n5. Since we know that the vampire was not awake, and the contrapositive statement tells us that this would be the case if the mummy was not awake, we can infer that the mummy was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes"
