If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the conclusion (Kate ate salad) is also true. However, if the condition is false (Ben did not eat pasta), the conditional statement doesn't tell us anything about whether Kate ate salad or not. In other words, just because Ben didn't eat pasta, we can't infer that Kate didn't eat salad; she might have or she might not have.\n\nAnswer: no"
