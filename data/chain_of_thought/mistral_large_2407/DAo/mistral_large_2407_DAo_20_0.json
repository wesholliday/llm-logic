We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The apple was not red.\"\n2. \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (\"the apple was red\") is true, then the conclusion (\"the banana was yellow\") is also true. However, if the condition is false, the conditional statement doesn't tell us anything about the conclusion.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that the apple was not red, the condition of the second statement is false. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the banana's color from these statements alone. The banana could be yellow or not yellow; we simply don't have enough information to determine this.\n\nAnswer: no"
