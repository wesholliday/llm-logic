We also know that \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true.\n3. However, since we know that Mary was not at the wedding, the condition for Sue being at the wedding is not met.\n4. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Sue was at the wedding. But can we conclude that Sue was not at the wedding? Not necessarily, because the given information does not provide any details about Sue's presence at the wedding independently of Mary's presence.\n\nSo, we cannot infer \"Sue was not at the wedding\" based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
