            "content": "Explanation: The given statements form a logical disjunction and a negation. The first statement, \"Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table,\" implies that at least one of these conditions must be true. The second statement, \"The book isn't resting on the table,\" negates one of these conditions. If the book is not on the table, then the only remaining option from the first statement is that the book must be on the shelf. This is an example of the logical process known as disjunctive syllogism.\n\nAnswer: yes"
