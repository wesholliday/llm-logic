            "content": "Explanation: The given statements form a logical disjunction and a negation. The first statement, \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch,\" presents two possibilities. The second statement, \"The remote control isn't hiding under the couch,\" eliminates one of those possibilities. In logic, when we have a disjunction \"P or Q\" and we know \"not Q,\" we can infer \"P.\" This is known as the disjunctive syllogism. Therefore, if the remote control is not under the couch, it must be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes"
