            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are \"Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden\" and \"Fido is not in the garden\". The first statement presents two possibilities: Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden. The second statement eliminates one of those possibilities, namely that Fido is in the garden. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that Fido is inside. This is an example of the logical principle known as disjunctive syllogism, where if one of the two conditions in an \"or\" statement is false, then the other condition must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
