The first statement presents two possibilities: the pen is in the bag or the pen is on the desk. The second statement eliminates one of those possibilities: the pen is not on the desk. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the pen is in the bag. This is an example of a disjunctive syllogism, where if one of the two possible statements is false, then the other must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
