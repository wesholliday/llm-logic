            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a logical disjunction (or) and a negation. The first statement, \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf,\" implies that at least one of these conditions must be true. The second statement, \"The toy isn't sitting on the shelf,\" negates one of these conditions. If the toy isn't on the shelf, then the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that the toy must be in the toy box. This is an example of the logical process known as disjunctive syllogism.\n\nAnswer: yes"
