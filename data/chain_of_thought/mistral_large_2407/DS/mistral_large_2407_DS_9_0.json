            "content": "Explanation: The given statements form a logical disjunction (or statement) and a negation. The first statement is \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it is blending in on the floor,\" which means that at least one of these two conditions must be true. The second statement is \"The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor,\" which negates the second part of the disjunction. If the puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor, then the only remaining option from the first statement is that the puzzle piece must be in the box. This is an example of the logical process known as disjunctive syllogism.\n\nAnswer: yes"
