The second statement is \"Either the dreb must be spened or it is vroombed.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true.\n\nGiven that the first statement asserts that \"The dreb must not be spened,\" the only way for the second statement to be true is if \"The dreb is vroombed.\" If \"The dreb is not spened,\" then according to the disjunction, \"The dreb is vroombed\" must be the case.\n\nAnswer: yes"
