The first statement is \"It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked.\" This can be rephrased as \"The fribble does not have to be crinked.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the fribble must be crinked or it is snurgled.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- Since the first statement tells us that the fribble does not have to be crinked, the only way for the second statement to be true is if the fribble is snurgled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that \"The fribble is snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
