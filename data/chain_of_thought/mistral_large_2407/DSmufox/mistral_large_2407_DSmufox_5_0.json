The first statement is \"It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled.\" This can be rewritten as \"The zinger must not be smoogled.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- Since the first statement tells us that the zinger must not be smoogled, the only way for the second statement to be true is if the zinger is fraggled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that \"The zinger is fraggled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
