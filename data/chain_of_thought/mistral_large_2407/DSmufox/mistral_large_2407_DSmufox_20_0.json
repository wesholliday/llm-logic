The first statement is \"It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned.\" This can be rewritten as \"The fleeg does not have to be surned.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- Since the first statement tells us that the fleeg does not have to be surned, the only way the second statement can be true is if the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes"
