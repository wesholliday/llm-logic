The first statement is \"It's not the case that the flob must be movated.\" This can be rephrased as \"The flob must not be movated.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true.\n\nNow, since we know from the first statement that \"The flob must not be movated,\" the only way for the second statement to be true is if \"The flob is skizzled.\" If the flob were not skizzled, then both conditions would be false, which would make the disjunction false. But we know the disjunction is true, so the flob must be skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
