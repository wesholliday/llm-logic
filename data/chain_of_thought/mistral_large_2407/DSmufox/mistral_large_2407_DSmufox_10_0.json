The first statement is \"It's not the case that the wug must be garpled.\" This can be rephrased as \"The wug does not have to be garpled.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the wug must be garpled or it is sproinged.\" This presents two possibilities: either the wug must be garpled, or the wug is sproinged.\n\nGiven that the first statement rules out the possibility that the wug must be garpled, we are left with the second part of the second statement: \"the wug is sproinged.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that \"The wug is sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
