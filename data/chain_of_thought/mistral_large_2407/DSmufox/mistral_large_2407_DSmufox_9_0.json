The first statement is \"It's not the case that the twonk must be plinked.\" This can be rephrased as \"The twonk does not have to be plinked.\"\n2. The second statement is \"Either the twonk must be plinked or it is varnished.\" This gives us two possibilities: either the twonk must be plinked, or the twonk is varnished.\n3. Since the first statement rules out the possibility that the twonk must be plinked, we are left with the second option from the second statement: the twonk is varnished.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes"
