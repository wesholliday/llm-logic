The first statement is \"It's not the case that the clug must be snugged.\" This means that the clug does not need to be snugged.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the clug must be snugged or it is fleeked.\" This gives us two possibilities: either the clug must be snugged, or the clug is fleeked.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that the clug does not need to be snugged, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
