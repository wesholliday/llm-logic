The first statement is \"It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged,\" which can be rewritten as \"The smonk must not be plagged.\"\n2. The second statement is \"Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true.\n3. Since we know from the first statement that \"The smonk must not be plagged,\" the only way for the second statement to be true is if \"The smonk is vreebled.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that \"The smonk is vreebled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
