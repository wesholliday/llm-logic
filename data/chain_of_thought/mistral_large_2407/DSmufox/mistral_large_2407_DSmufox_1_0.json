The first statement is \"It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled.\" This can be rewritten as \"The flugel must not be zargled.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- Since the first statement tells us that the flugel must not be zargled, the only way for the second statement to be true is if the flugel is blimmed.\n\nTherefore, from these two statements, we can indeed infer that \"The flugel is blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
