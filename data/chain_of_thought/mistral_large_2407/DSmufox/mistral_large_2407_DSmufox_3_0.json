The first statement is \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked.\" This can be rephrased as \"The splat does not have to be quanked.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed.\" This gives us two possibilities: either the splat has to be quanked, or the splat is morphed.\n\nNow, since we know from the first statement that the splat does not have to be quanked, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the splat is morphed.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that \"The splat is morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
