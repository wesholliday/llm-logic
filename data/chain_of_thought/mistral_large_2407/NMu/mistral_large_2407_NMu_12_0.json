            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair\" implies that there is no obligation or necessity for the jacket to be on the chair. This leaves open the possibility that the jacket could be elsewhere, meaning it might not be draped over the chair. The use of \"must\" in the original statement suggests a lack of requirement, which aligns with the possibility expressed by \"might not.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
