            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter' implies that there is no obligation or necessity for the milk to be on the counter. This means that it is possible for the milk to be elsewhere. Therefore, it is indeed possible that the milk might not be on the counter. The phrase 'might not' indicates possibility, which is consistent with the lack of necessity expressed in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
