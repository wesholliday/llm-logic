            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\" implies that there is no obligation or necessity for the toy to be in the toy box. This means that the toy could be anywhere, including not being in the toy box. Therefore, it is possible that the toy might not be in the toy box. The phrase \"might not\" indicates a possibility, which is consistent with the lack of necessity expressed in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
