            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza' implies that there is no certainty or necessity that Sue chose pizza. This lack of certainty opens up the possibility that Sue might not have chosen pizza. In other words, if it's not certain that Sue chose pizza, then it is possible that she did not choose it. Therefore, the inference 'Sue might not have chosen pizza' is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
