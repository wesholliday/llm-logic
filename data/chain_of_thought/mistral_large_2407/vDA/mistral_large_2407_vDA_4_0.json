Therefore, not-Q.\n\nIn this case, the argument is:\n\n1. If the alien visited Mars (P), then the robot visited Jupiter (Q).\n2. The alien did not visit Mars (Not-P).\n3. Therefore, the robot did not visit Jupiter (Not-Q).\n\nThe argument follows the modus tollens structure exactly, so if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes."
