Therefore, not-Q.\n\nIn this case, the argument follows the same structure:\n\n1. If Tom watched football (P), then Jen watched basketball (Q).\n2. Tom did not watch football (Not-P).\n3. Therefore, Jen did not watch basketball (Not-Q).\n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens structure, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes."
