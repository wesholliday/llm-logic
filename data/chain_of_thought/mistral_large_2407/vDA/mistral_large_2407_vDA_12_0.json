            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe argument is structured as follows:\n1. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. (P \u2192 Q)\n2. Joe did not go to the park. (\u00acP)\n3. Therefore, Lucy did not go to the zoo. (\u00acQ)\n\nIn logic, the form of this argument is known as \"Denying the Antecedent.\" The valid forms of argument involving conditionals are \"Modus Ponens\" (affirming the antecedent) and \"Modus Tollens\" (denying the consequent). Denying the antecedent is a logical fallacy because the truth of the consequent (Q) is not necessarily determined by the falsity of the antecedent (P).\n\nFor example, even if Joe did not go to the park, Lucy could still have gone to the zoo for other reasons. The premises do not logically necessitate the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
