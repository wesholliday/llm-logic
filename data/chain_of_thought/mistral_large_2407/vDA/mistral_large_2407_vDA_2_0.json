            "content": "Explanation: The given argument follows the form of a logical argument known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument. The structure of Modus Tollens is:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not-P.\n3. Therefore, not-Q.\n\nIn this case, the argument is:\n\n1. If the griffin was in the forest (P), then the unicorn was in the forest (Q).\n2. The griffin was not in the forest (Not-P).\n3. Therefore, the unicorn was not in the forest (Not-Q).\n\nThis argument is logically valid because the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. If the griffin being in the forest necessarily implies that the unicorn is in the forest, and we know that the griffin was not in the forest, then it logically follows that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes."
