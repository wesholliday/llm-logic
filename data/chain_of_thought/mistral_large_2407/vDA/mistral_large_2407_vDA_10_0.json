If P, then Q (If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside)\n2. Not P (The dog was not inside)\n3. Therefore, not Q (The cat was not outside)\n\nThis form of argument is known as Denying the Antecedent, which is a logical fallacy. The truth of \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not P\" does not necessarily guarantee the truth of \"Not Q\". In other words, just because the dog was not inside does not necessarily mean that the cat was not outside. The cat's location is not determined by the dog's location based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
