            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument is structured as follows:\n1. If P, then Q (where P is \"Alex finished the race\" and Q is \"Chris finished the race\").\n2. Not P (Alex did not finish the race).\n3. Therefore, not Q (Chris did not finish the race).\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument. In Modus Tollens, if the conditional statement (If P, then Q) is true and the negation of the antecedent (Not P) is true, then the negation of the consequent (Not Q) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the structure of the argument, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
