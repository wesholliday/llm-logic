Therefore, not-Q.\n\nIn this case, let P be \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q be \"the muffins were blueberry\". The argument matches the structure of modus tollens exactly:\n\n1. If the cake was chocolate (P), then the muffins were blueberry (Q).\n2. The cake was not chocolate (Not-P).\n3. Therefore, the muffins were not blueberry (Not-Q).\n\nSince the argument follows the structure of modus tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes."
