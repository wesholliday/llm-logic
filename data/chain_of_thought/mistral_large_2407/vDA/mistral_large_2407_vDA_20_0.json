The structure is as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q. (If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.)\n2. Not-P. (The apple was not red.)\n3. Therefore, not-Q. (The banana was not yellow.)\n\nIn modus tollens, if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. This means the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes."
