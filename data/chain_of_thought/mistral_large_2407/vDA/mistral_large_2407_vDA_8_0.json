            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument is structured as follows:\n1. If P, then Q (where P is \"the vampire was awake\" and Q is \"the mummy was awake\").\n2. Not P (the vampire was not awake).\n3. Therefore, not Q (the mummy was not awake).\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus Tollens is structured as:\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nHowever, the given argument has \"Not P\" as the second premise instead of \"Not Q\". To make it fit the Modus Tollens form, we need to consider the contrapositive of the first premise, which is \"If not Q, then not P\". The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. So, if \"If P, then Q\" is true, then \"If not Q, then not P\" is also true.\n\nUsing the contrapositive, the argument becomes:\n1. If not Q, then not P.\n2. Not P.\n3. Therefore, not Q.\n\nThis is not a standard form of argument and is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises. The second premise does not give us any information about Q, so we cannot logically conclude \"not Q\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
