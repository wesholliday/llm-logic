The argument is in the form of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens is structured as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not-P.\n3. Therefore, not-Q.\n\nIn this case, the argument is:\n\n1. If the doll was plastic (P), then the truck was metal (Q).\n2. The doll was not plastic (Not-P).\n3. Therefore, the truck was not metal (Not-Q).\n\nSince the argument follows the structure of modus tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes."
