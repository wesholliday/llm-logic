            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument without considering the truth of the premises. The argument is in the form of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. The structure is as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q (If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding)\n2. Not-P (Mary was not at the wedding)\n3. Therefore, Not-Q (Sue was not at the wedding)\n\nIn modus tollens, if the first premise is true and the second premise is true, then the conclusion must be true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
