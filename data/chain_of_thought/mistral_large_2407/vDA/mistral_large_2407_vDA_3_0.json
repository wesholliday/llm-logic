If P, then Q (If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel)\n2. Not P (The book was not written by James)\n3. Therefore, not Q (The book is not a mystery novel)\n\nIn this case, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. Just because the book was not written by James does not necessarily mean it is not a mystery novel, as there could be other authors who write mystery novels.\n\nAnswer: no"
