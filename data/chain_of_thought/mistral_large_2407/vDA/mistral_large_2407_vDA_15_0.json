Not-P.\n3. Therefore, not-Q.\n\nIn this case, the argument can be rephrased as:\n\n1. If Sam took a plane (P), then Erin took a train (Q).\n2. Sam did not take a plane (Not-P).\n3. Therefore, Erin did not take a train (Not-Q).\n\nGiven that the argument follows the structure of modus tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes."
