Therefore, not-P.\n\nIn this case, the argument is structured as:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt (P), then Mark bought the blue shirt (Q).\n2. Lisa did not buy the red shirt (Not-P).\n3. Therefore, Mark did not buy the blue shirt (Not-Q).\n\nHowever, the given argument has the second premise as \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" (Not-P) and the conclusion as \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" (Not-Q), which is a reversal of the proper modus tollens structure. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no."
