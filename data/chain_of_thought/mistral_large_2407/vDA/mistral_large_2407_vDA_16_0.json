The argument is in the form of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. The structure is as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q. (If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.)\n2. Not-P. (The shirt was not cotton.)\n3. Therefore, not-Q. (The pants were not denim.)\n\nIn modus tollens, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true. The argument given follows this structure exactly. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes."
