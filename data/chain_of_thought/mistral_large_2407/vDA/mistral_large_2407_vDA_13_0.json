            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument is structured as follows:\n1. If P, then Q (If the car was red, then the truck was blue)\n2. Not P (The car was not red)\n3. Therefore, not Q (The truck was not blue)\n\nThis form of argument is known as Denying the Antecedent. In logic, Denying the Antecedent is a formal fallacy. The truth of \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not P\" does not necessarily guarantee the truth of \"Not Q\". For example, consider the following:\n- If it is raining, then the ground is wet. (If P, then Q)\n- It is not raining. (Not P)\n- Therefore, the ground is not wet. (Not Q)\n\nEven if it is not raining, the ground could still be wet from other causes. Thus, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
