Therefore, not-Q.\n\nIn this case, the argument is:\n\n1. If Jeff played basketball (P), then Amy played tennis (Q).\n2. Jeff did not play basketball (Not-P).\n3. Therefore, Amy did not play tennis (Not-Q).\n\nThe argument follows the modus tollens structure exactly, so it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes."
