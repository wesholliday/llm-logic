Therefore, not-Q.\n\nIn this case, let's replace P with \"the bear was in the cave\" and Q with \"the wolf was in the den\":\n\n1. If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n2. The bear was not in the cave.\n3. Therefore, the wolf was not in the den.\n\nThe argument follows the modus tollens structure perfectly, so it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes."
