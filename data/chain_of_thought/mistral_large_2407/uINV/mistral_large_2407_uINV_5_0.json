            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\" The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of the statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P,\" or \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\" However, the question asks about \"If not P, then not Q,\" which is the inverse of the original statement, not the contrapositive. The inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\n\nAnswer: no"
