            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow.\" The question asks whether the contrapositive of this statement is true. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" It is a logical equivalence, meaning that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true. However, the question asks about the inverse of the original statement, which is \"If not P, then not Q.\" The inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the inverse from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
