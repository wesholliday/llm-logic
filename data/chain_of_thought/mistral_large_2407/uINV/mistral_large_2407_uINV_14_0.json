            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" is a conditional statement. It does not provide information about what happens when the bear is not in the cave. The wolf could still be in the den, or it might not be. We cannot logically infer the wolf's location based solely on the bear not being in the cave. This is because the original statement does not establish a relationship between the bear not being in the cave and the wolf's location.\n\nAnswer: no"
