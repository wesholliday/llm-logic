            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Sam took a plane\" and Q is \"Erin took a train.\" The question asks if we can infer the inverse, which is \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\" However, a conditional statement and its inverse are not logically equivalent. Knowing P \u2192 Q does not necessarily mean that \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ is true. For example, it's possible that Erin took a train regardless of whether Sam took a plane or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\n\nAnswer: no"
