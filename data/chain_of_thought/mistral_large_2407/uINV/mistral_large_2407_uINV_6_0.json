            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q is \"Bob chose pasta.\" The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, and it is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then switching their places. So the contrapositive of P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, which translates to \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\" However, the question asks about a different statement: \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta,\" which is the inverse of the original statement (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ). The inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the inverse from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
