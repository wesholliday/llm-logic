            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the vampire was awake\" and Q is \"the mummy was awake.\" The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P,\" or in this case, \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\" However, the question phrasing is \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake,\" which is the inverse of the original statement, not the contrapositive. The inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement, unlike the contrapositive. Therefore, we cannot infer the inverse from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
