The question asks if we can infer \"If not P, then not Q\". However, the correct inference from \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". We cannot directly infer \"If not P, then not Q\" from the original statement. For example, it's possible that Jen watched basketball regardless of whether Tom watched football or not.\n\nAnswer: no"
