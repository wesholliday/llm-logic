            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel.\" The question asks whether the contrapositive of this statement is true. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" In this case, the contrapositive would be \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\" This is logically equivalent to the original statement, so if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. However, the question asks about the inverse of the original statement, which is \"If not P, then not Q,\" or \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\" The inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement, so we cannot infer the inverse from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
