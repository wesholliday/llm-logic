It does not provide any information about the color of the truck if the car is not red. In logical terms, the statement is of the form \"If P, then Q,\" which does not necessarily imply \"If not P, then not Q.\" Therefore, we cannot infer that if the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\n\nAnswer: no"
