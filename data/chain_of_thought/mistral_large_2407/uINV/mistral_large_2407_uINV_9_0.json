            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" The question asks us to infer the truth of the contrapositive, which is \"If not Q, then not P.\" However, the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, not the inverse. The inverse, \"If not P, then not Q,\" is not necessarily true based on the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: no"
