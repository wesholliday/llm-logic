However, it then goes on to negate the second possibility, stating that it's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry. This leaves us with only one remaining possibility: that the cookies are in the jar. Therefore, we can infer that the cookies are indeed in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes"
