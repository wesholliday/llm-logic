Therefore, Q.\n\nIn this case, the argument is:\n\n1. If Sam took a plane (P), then Erin took a train (Q).\n2. Sam took a plane (P).\n3. Therefore, Erin took a train (Q).\n\nModus ponens is a logically valid form of argument. This means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. In other words, the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes."
