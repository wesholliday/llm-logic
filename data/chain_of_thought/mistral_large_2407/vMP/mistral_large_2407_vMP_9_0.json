            "content": "Explanation: The given argument follows a classic form of logical reasoning known as modus ponens. Modus ponens has the structure:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. P.\n3. Therefore, Q.\n\nIn this case:\n- P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt.\"\n- Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThe argument states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. Since the second premise confirms that Lisa did indeed buy the red shirt, the conclusion that Mark bought the blue shirt logically follows. This form of argument is always valid because if the condition (P) is true, then the consequence (Q) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes."
