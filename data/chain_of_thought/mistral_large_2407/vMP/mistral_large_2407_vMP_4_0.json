Modus ponens follows the structure: If P, then Q; P; therefore, Q. In this case, P is \"the alien visited Mars\" and Q is \"the robot visited Jupiter\". The first premise presents a conditional statement (If P, then Q), and the second premise affirms the antecedent (P) of that conditional. Therefore, the conclusion that affirms the consequent (Q) logically follows.\n\nAnswer: yes."
