            "content": "Explanation: The given argument follows a form of reasoning known as modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. Modus ponens is structured as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q (where P and Q are propositions).\n2. P\n3. Therefore, Q.\n\nIn this case:\n- P is \"the apple was red\"\n- Q is \"the banana was yellow\"\n\nThe first premise states \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow,\" which is a conditional statement (If P, then Q). The second premise confirms the antecedent (P) by stating \"The apple was red.\" According to modus ponens, if the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true. Therefore, the conclusion \"The banana was yellow\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
