If P, then Q (where P and Q are propositions).\n2. P\n3. Therefore, Q\n\nIn this case, the argument can be rephrased as:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding (P), then Sue was at the wedding (Q).\n2. Mary was at the wedding (P).\n3. Therefore, Sue was at the wedding (Q).\n\nThis form of argument is logically valid because the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. If the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
