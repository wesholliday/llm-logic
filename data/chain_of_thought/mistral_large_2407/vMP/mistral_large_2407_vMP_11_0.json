Therefore, Q\n\nIn this case, P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins were blueberry\". The argument claims that if the first statement is true (if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry) and the second statement is also true (the cake was chocolate), then the conclusion (the muffins were blueberry) must be true. This is a logically valid form of argument because the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
