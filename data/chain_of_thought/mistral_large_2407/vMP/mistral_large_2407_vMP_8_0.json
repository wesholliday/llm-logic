            "content": "Explanation: The given argument follows a classic form of logical reasoning known as modus ponens. Modus ponens has the following structure:\n\n1. If P, then Q (where P and Q are propositions).\n2. P\n3. Therefore, Q.\n\nIn this case, the argument can be rephrased as:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake (P), then the mummy was awake (Q).\n2. The vampire was awake (P).\n3. Therefore, the mummy was awake (Q).\n\nAccording to modus ponens, if the first premise (the conditional statement) is true and the second premise (the antecedent of the conditional statement) is also true, then the conclusion (the consequent of the conditional statement) must be true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes."
