            "content": "Explanation: The given argument follows the form of a logical argument known as modus ponens. Modus ponens has the structure: If P, then Q; P; therefore, Q. In this case, P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal\". The first premise states that if P is true, then Q is true. The second premise confirms that P is indeed true. Therefore, according to the rules of logic, Q must also be true. This means that the conclusion \"The truck was metal\" logically follows from the premises, making the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
