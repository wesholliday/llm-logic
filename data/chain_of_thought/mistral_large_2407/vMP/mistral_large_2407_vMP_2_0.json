If P, then Q (where P and Q are propositions).\n2. P\n3. Therefore, Q.\n\nIn this case, P is \"the griffin was in the forest,\" and Q is \"the unicorn was in the forest.\" The argument claims that if the presence of the griffin in the forest implies the presence of the unicorn in the forest, and given that the griffin was indeed in the forest, then it logically follows that the unicorn was also in the forest. This form of argument is deductively valid, meaning that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes."
