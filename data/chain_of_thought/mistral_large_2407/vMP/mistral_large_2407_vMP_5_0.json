            "content": "Explanation: The given argument follows the form of a logically valid argument known as modus ponens. Modus ponens has the structure: If P, then Q; P; therefore, Q. In this case, P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis\". The first premise states that if P is true, then Q is true. The second premise confirms that P is indeed true. Therefore, according to the rules of modus ponens, we can logically conclude that Q is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
