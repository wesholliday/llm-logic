            "content": "Explanation: The given argument follows a form of reasoning known as modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. The structure of the argument is as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q (If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel)\n2. P (The book was written by James)\n3. Therefore, Q (The book is a mystery novel)\n\nIn modus ponens, if the conditional statement (If P, then Q) is true and the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
