The structure of the argument is as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q (If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside)\n2. P (The dog was inside)\n3. Therefore, Q (The cat was outside)\n\nIn modus ponens, if the first premise (the conditional statement) is true and the second premise (the antecedent of the conditional statement) is also true, then the conclusion (the consequent of the conditional statement) must be true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
