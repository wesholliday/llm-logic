            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the second statement can be inferred from the first, we need to consider the logical relationship between them. The first statement is \"If you glurp, it will hurt my snarfs.\" This can be represented logically as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"you glurp\" and Q is \"it will hurt my snarfs.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"If you glurp and I am wearing plorks, it will hurt my snarfs.\" Logically, this can be represented as \"If P and R, then Q,\" where R is \"I am wearing plorks.\"\n\nIn logic, if \"If P, then Q\" is true, then \"If P and R, then Q\" is also true because adding an additional condition (R) to the premise (P) does not change the outcome (Q) if the original condition (P) is sufficient to cause Q.\n\nTherefore, if \"If you glurp, it will hurt my snarfs\" is true, then \"If you glurp and I am wearing plorks, it will hurt my snarfs\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes."
