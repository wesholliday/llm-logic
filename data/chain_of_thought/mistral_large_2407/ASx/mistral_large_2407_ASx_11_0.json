            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is \"If the zibble is zapped, then the glorp will zoon.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the zibble is zapped\" and Q is \"the glorp will zoon.\" The question asks if we can infer \"If the zibble is zapped and the quib is squinked, then the glorp will zoon.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P and R, then Q,\" where R is \"the quib is squinked.\"\n\nIn logic, if a statement \"If P, then Q\" is true, then the statement \"If P and R, then Q\" is also true, regardless of what R is. This is because if P is sufficient for Q, then adding another condition (R) to P doesn't change the fact that P is sufficient for Q.\n\nTherefore, if \"If the zibble is zapped, then the glorp will zoon\" is true, then \"If the zibble is zapped and the quib is squinked, then the glorp will zoon\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
