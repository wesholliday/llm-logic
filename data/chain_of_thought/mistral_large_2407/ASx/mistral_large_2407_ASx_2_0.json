            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is \"If we crink the snoogle, then we'll plook a nurp.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"we crink the snoogle\" and Q is \"we'll plook a nurp.\" The question asks if we can infer \"If we crink the snoogle and a wug zites, then we'll plook a nurp.\" This new statement has the form \"If P and R, then Q,\" where R is \"a wug zites.\" In logic, if a statement of the form \"If P, then Q\" is true, then any statement of the form \"If P and R, then Q\" is also true, regardless of what R is. This is because adding another condition to the hypothesis (the \"if\" part) does not change the truth of the original implication.\n\nAnswer: yes"
