This is because adding another condition to the hypothesis (P) does not change the truth of the original implication. If P is sufficient for Q, then P and any other condition (R) is also sufficient for Q.\n\nTherefore, from the given statement, we can indeed infer the new statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
