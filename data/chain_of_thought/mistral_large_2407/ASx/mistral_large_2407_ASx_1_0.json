            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the statement \"If the snark was blimmed and sproinged, then it flooped\" can be inferred from \"If the snark was blimmed, then it flooped,\" we need to consider the logical relationship between these statements.\n\nThe original statement is a conditional: \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the snark was blimmed\" and Q is \"it flooped.\"\n\nThe new statement adds an additional condition to P: \"If P and R, then Q,\" where R is \"the snark was sproinged.\"\n\nIn logic, if \"P implies Q\" is true, then \"P and R implies Q\" is also true, because adding an additional condition to the antecedent (the \"if\" part) does not change the truth of the implication. If the snark being blimmed is enough to conclude that it flooped, then adding the condition that it was also sproinged doesn't change the conclusion that it flooped.\n\nTherefore, the inference is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
