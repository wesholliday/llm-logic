This is because if P is sufficient for Q, then P combined with any other condition is also sufficient for Q.\n\nTherefore, if \"If you bringle the splotch, then the bloop will floosh\" is true, then \"If you bringle the splotch and the crungle is splooted, then the bloop will floosh\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes."
