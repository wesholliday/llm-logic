This is because if P being true is enough to guarantee that Q is true, then P being true along with any other condition (R) will also guarantee that Q is true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statement, we can indeed infer that \"If the fribble is in the snarp and the snarp is flooping, then it is flugged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes."
