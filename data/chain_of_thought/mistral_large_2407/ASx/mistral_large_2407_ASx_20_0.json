            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is \"If the plim is grobbled, then the whiffle will sploosh.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q.\" The question asks if we can infer \"If the plim is grobbled and the drazzle is drooped, then the whiffle will sploosh.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P and R, then Q.\"\n\nIn logic, if a statement \"If P, then Q\" is true, then the statement \"If P and R, then Q\" is also true. This is because if P is sufficient to guarantee Q, then P combined with any other condition (R) will also guarantee Q. The additional condition (R) doesn't negate the original condition (P) leading to Q.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we can indeed infer the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
