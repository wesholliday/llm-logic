            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled\" implies that there is some possibility or scenario where the flob was not skizzled. This is because the phrase \"must have been\" indicates necessity, and negating it suggests that this necessity does not hold in all cases. Therefore, it opens up the possibility that the flob might not have been skizzled. The phrase \"might not have been\" indicates possibility, which is consistent with the negation of the necessity expressed in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
