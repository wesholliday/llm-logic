This leaves open the possibility that the dreb might not have been vroombed. In other words, it suggests that there is some doubt or uncertainty about whether the dreb was vroombed. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that \"The dreb might not have been vroombed\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
