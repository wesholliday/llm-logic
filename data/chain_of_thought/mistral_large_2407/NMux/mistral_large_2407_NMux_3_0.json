This leaves open the possibility that the splat might not have been morphed. In other words, it suggests that there is some uncertainty or that it is not guaranteed that the splat was morphed. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that \"The splat might not have been morphed\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
