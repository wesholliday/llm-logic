            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed\" implies that there is some possibility that the flugel was not blimmed. This is because the phrase \"must have been\" indicates certainty, and negating it with \"It's not the case that\" introduces uncertainty or possibility. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that \"The flugel might not have been blimmed,\" as this statement also expresses the possibility that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
