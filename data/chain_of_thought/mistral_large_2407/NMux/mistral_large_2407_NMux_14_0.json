            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that the clug must have been fleeked\" implies that there is no certainty or necessity that the clug was fleeked. This lack of certainty opens up the possibility that the clug might not have been fleeked. In other words, if it's not certain that the clug was fleeked, then it is possible that it wasn't. Therefore, the statement \"The clug might not have been fleeked\" is a reasonable inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
