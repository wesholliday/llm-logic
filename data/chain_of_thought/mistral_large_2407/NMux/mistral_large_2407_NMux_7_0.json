            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked\" implies that there is some possibility that the whiffle was not shanked. This is because the statement negates the certainty of the whiffle being shanked. Therefore, it leaves open the possibility that the whiffle might not have been shanked. In logical terms, if it's not necessarily true that the whiffle was shanked, then it follows that it might not have been shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
