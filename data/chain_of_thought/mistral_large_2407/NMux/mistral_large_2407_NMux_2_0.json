            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'It's not the case that the wug must have been flooped' implies that there is no certainty or necessity that the wug was flooped. This lack of certainty allows for the possibility that the wug might not have been flooped. In other words, since it's not definite that the wug was flooped, it leaves open the possibility that it wasn't. Therefore, we can indeed infer 'The wug might not have been flooped' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
