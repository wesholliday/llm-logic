            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed\" implies that there is no certainty or necessity that the flug was blummed. This lack of certainty opens up the possibility that the flug might not have been blummed. In other words, if it's not certain that the flug was blummed, then it is possible that it wasn't. Therefore, the inference \"The flug might not have been blummed\" is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
