            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step. The first statement is a conditional: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\" This means that if Sam took a plane, it is a necessity that Erin took a train. The second statement is \"Erin might not have taken a train,\" which introduces a possibility that Erin did not take a train. If Erin did not take a train, then according to the first statement, Sam could not have taken a plane, because that would necessitate Erin taking a train. Therefore, if Erin might not have taken a train, it logically follows that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes"
