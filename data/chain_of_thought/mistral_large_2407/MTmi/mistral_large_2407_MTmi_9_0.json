            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt' implies that Lisa buying the red shirt is a sufficient condition for Mark buying the blue shirt. However, the second statement 'Mark might not have bought the blue shirt' introduces uncertainty about whether Mark actually bought the blue shirt. If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then according to the first statement, Lisa could not have bought the red shirt. Therefore, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes"
