            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional: \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" This can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"The banana might not have been yellow.\" This introduces doubt about Q, but it doesn't definitively negate Q. It can be interpreted as \"not necessarily Q\" or \u00acQ is possible.\n\n3. To infer \"The apple was not red\" (\u00acP), we would need to know for certain that Q is false because the contrapositive of P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP. However, we only know that Q is not necessarily true, not that it is definitely false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer \"The apple was not red\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
