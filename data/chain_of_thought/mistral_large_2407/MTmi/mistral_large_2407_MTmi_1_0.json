            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Sue might not have been at the wedding.\" This introduces doubt about Q, but it doesn't explicitly negate Q. It simply suggests that Q is not certain.\n\nTo infer \"Mary was not at the wedding\" (which is \u00acP), we would need to have concrete evidence that Sue was not at the wedding (\u00acQ). However, the second statement does not provide that certainty. It only casts doubt on Q, but it doesn't confirm \u00acQ.\n\nIn logical inference, we cannot conclude \u00acP merely based on the uncertainty of Q. We would need a definite \u00acQ to infer \u00acP using Modus Tollens.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no"
