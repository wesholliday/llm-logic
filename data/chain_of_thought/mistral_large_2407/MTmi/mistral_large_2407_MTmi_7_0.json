In other words, if Alex finished, then Chris definitely finished.\n\n2. \"Chris might not have finished the race\" introduces uncertainty about Chris's completion of the race. It suggests that there is a possibility that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Alex finished the race, then according to the first statement, Chris must have finished the race. However, this contradicts the second statement that Chris might not have finished the race.\n\n- Therefore, to be consistent with both statements, we must consider the scenario where Alex did not finish the race. If Alex did not finish the race, then the first statement does not apply, and the second statement can be true without any contradiction.\n\nAnswer: yes."
