            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the statements and their implications.\n\n1. \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake\" can be written as a conditional statement: Vampire_Awake \u2192 Mummy_Awake.\n2. \"The mummy might not have been awake\" means that the mummy being awake is not a certainty, so Mummy_Awake could be false.\n\nNow, let's consider the contrapositive of the first statement, which is logically equivalent: \u00acMummy_Awake \u2192 \u00acVampire_Awake. This means that if the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\n\nSince we know that the mummy might not have been awake (Mummy_Awake could be false), it follows that the vampire might not have been awake as well. However, we cannot definitively conclude that the vampire was not awake, as the original statement only tells us about the mummy's possible state, not a definite one.\n\nAnswer: no"
