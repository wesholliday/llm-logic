The first statement is a conditional: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" This can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"The truck might not have been metal.\" This introduces doubt about Q, but it doesn't definitively negate Q. It can be written as \u00acQ might be true.\n\n3. The question is whether we can infer \"The doll was not plastic\" (\u00acP).\n\n4. In logical inference, if P \u2192 Q is true and Q is false, then P must be false. However, the second statement doesn't confirm that Q is false; it only introduces the possibility.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that P is false based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
