            "content": "Explanation: Let's analyze this step by step. The first statement is a conditional: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\" This means that if Tom watched football, it is a necessity that Jen watched basketball. The second statement is \"Jen might not have watched basketball,\" which introduces doubt about Jen watching basketball. If Jen might not have watched basketball, then the condition for Tom watching football is not met, because we know that if Tom watched football, Jen must have watched basketball. Therefore, if there's a possibility that Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom could not have watched football.\n\nAnswer: yes"
