This is a conditional statement that can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is 'Sue chose pizza' and Q is 'Bob chose pasta'.\n\n2. We are also given that 'Bob might not have chosen pasta'. This means that Q is not necessarily true.\n\n3. If P \u2192 Q is true, and Q is not necessarily true, then P cannot be true. This is because if P were true, Q would have to be true (according to the first statement), but we know that Q might not be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'Sue did not choose pizza'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
