            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired\" establishes a condition (getting enough sleep) and a result (not being tired). However, when we add an additional condition (doing hard labor), we're changing the context. The original statement doesn't account for the effects of hard labor, which could indeed make someone tired regardless of how much sleep they've had. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first, as it introduces a new variable that could invalidate the result.\n\nAnswer: no"
