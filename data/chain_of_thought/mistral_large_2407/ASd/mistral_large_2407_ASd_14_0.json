            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If I study hard, I will pass the test\" presents a condition (studying hard) and a result (passing the test). The proposed inference adds an additional condition (\"and the test is in Chinese\"). Logically, if the original condition leads to the result, adding another condition doesn't negate the original cause-and-effect relationship unless the new condition explicitly contradicts or impedes the result. In this case, the test being in Chinese might make it harder, but it doesn't logically negate the possibility of passing if one studies hard. Therefore, the inference is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
