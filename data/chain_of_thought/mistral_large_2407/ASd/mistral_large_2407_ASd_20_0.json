            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If I take medication, I will feel better\" assumes that the medication is in a condition that makes it effective. When medication expires, its effectiveness can decrease, or it can even become harmful. Therefore, the statement does not necessarily hold true if the medication is expired. The inference is not logically valid because it introduces a new condition (the medication being expired) that could change the outcome.\n\nAnswer: no"
