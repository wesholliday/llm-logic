However, the additional condition \"and it was misrouted\" introduces a new factor that could potentially disrupt the delivery process. Being misrouted typically means the package has been sent to the wrong location, which would likely delay its arrival. Therefore, if the package has been misrouted, the original guarantee of same-day arrival no longer holds.\n\nAnswer: no"
