However, when we add a second condition \"and eat junk food,\" it introduces a new factor that can counteract the effects of exercise. Eating junk food is typically associated with high calorie intake, which can negate the calorie deficit created by exercise. Therefore, we cannot assume that the weight loss will still occur when a conflicting factor is introduced.\n\nAnswer: no"
