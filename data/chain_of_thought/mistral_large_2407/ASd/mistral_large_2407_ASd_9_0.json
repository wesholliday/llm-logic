            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A\" has a single condition for getting an A: the essay being well-written. The second statement introduces an additional condition: the essay being turned in late. Typically, turning in an essay late might lead to penalties or deductions, which are not accounted for in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot assume that the student will still get an A if the essay is turned in late, as the original statement does not provide any information about the consequences of lateness.\n\nAnswer: no"
