            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is \"If the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm.\" This statement doesn't specify any conditions about the pilot light. It simply states that whenever the oven is on, the kitchen is warm. The second statement adds a condition \"and the pilot light is out,\" but this doesn't change the fact that the oven is on. If the oven being on is sufficient to warm the kitchen, as the original statement claims, then adding an additional condition about the pilot light doesn't negate the effect of the oven being on. Therefore, if the oven is on, regardless of the pilot light's status, the kitchen should still be warm according to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
