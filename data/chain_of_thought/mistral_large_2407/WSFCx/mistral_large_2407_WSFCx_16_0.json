            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The blurble might wobble or it might floob the grazzle\" uses the conjunction \"or,\" which typically indicates that at least one of the two actions could happen, but not necessarily both. However, in this context, the use of \"or\" is not exclusive because the sentence doesn't imply that only one of the actions can occur. The phrase \"might wobble\" and \"might floob the grazzle\" both indicate possibilities that are not mutually exclusive. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the blurble could both wobble and floob the grazzle.\n\nAnswer: yes"
