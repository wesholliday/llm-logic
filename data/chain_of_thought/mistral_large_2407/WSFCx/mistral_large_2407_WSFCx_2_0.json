The word \"or\" in English typically implies exclusivity unless specified otherwise. In contrast, the word \"and\" suggests that both actions will occur. Therefore, we cannot directly infer the sentence with \"and\" from the sentence with \"or\" because it changes the implied relationship between the two actions.\n\nAnswer: no"
