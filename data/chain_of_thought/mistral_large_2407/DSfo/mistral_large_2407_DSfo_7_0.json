We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet\" (Let's call this Statement A)\n2. \"Either the umbrella is tucked away in the closet or it is in the car\" (Let's call this Statement B)\n\nStatement B presents two possibilities: the umbrella is in the closet or it is in the car. However, Statement A eliminates the first possibility (the umbrella being in the closet). Therefore, according to Statement B, the only remaining possibility is that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes"
