We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The book isn't resting on the table.\"\n2. \"Either the book is resting on the table or it is on the shelf.\"\n\nThe second statement presents two possibilities: the book is on the table or the book is on the shelf. However, the first statement eliminates the possibility that the book is on the table. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes"
