The second statement is \"Either the milk is chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter.\" This gives us two possible locations for the milk: in the fridge or on the counter.\n3. Since we know from the first statement that the milk is not in the fridge, the only remaining option from the second statement is that the milk is on the counter.\n\nTherefore, based on these two statements, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes"
