In logic, when we have a disjunction (an 'or' statement) and we know that one of the possibilities is false, we can infer that the other possibility must be true. Since we know that the scarf isn't on the coat rack, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes"
