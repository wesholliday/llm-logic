Since the first statement eliminates one of those possibilities (that the sunglasses are perched on her head), we are left with the other possibility, which is that the sunglasses are in her bag. This is an example of a disjunctive syllogism, where the negation of one of the disjuncts implies the truth of the other.\n\nAnswer: yes"
