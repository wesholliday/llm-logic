We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The pen isn't on my desk\"\n2. \"Either the pen is on my desk or it is in my bag\"\n\nThe second statement is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true. However, the first statement tells us that the pen is not on the desk, which eliminates the first condition of the disjunction. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
