We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry.\"\n2. \"Either the cookies are hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar.\"\n\nThe second statement presents us with two possibilities: the cookies are in the pantry or they are in the jar. However, the first statement eliminates one of these possibilities by telling us that the cookies aren't in the pantry. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes."
