We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet.\"\n2. \"Either the keys are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer.\"\n\nThe second statement presents two possibilities for the location of the keys. However, the first statement eliminates one of those possibilities, namely that the keys are dangling in the cabinet. Therefore, according to the second statement, if the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, the only remaining option is that they are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
