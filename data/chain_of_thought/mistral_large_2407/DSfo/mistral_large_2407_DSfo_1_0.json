The second statement presents two possibilities: either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside. Since the first statement tells us that Fido is not in the garden, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that Fido is inside. Therefore, we can logically infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes"
