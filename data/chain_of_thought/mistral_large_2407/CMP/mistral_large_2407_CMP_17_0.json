    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the flu, common cold, and strep throat are the most prevalent illnesses this season. Doctors expect the flu likely will infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, with strep infections lagging behind. These are the only major illnesses spreading, so if colds don\u2019t infect the most people, then if flu doesn\u2019t, strep will. Moreover, flu likely will infect the most and hence colds likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if flu doesn\u2019t infect the most, strep will?",

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

            "content": "Explanation: The given information states that the flu is likely to infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, with strep throat being the least prevalent. It also states that if the flu doesn't infect the most people, then strep throat will. This is a conditional statement that doesn't necessarily follow from the initial likelihoods. The likelihood of the flu infecting the most people doesn't change the conditional statement that if the flu doesn't, then strep will. The key here is to understand that the conditional statement is independent of the initial likelihoods.\n\nAnswer: yes"
