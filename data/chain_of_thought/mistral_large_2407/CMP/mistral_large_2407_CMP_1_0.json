    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the Lakers, Warriors, and Celtics have the best odds to win the NBA championship. Based on expert projections, it is most likely the Lakers will win, followed closely by the Warriors, with the Celtics having much lower odds. These are the only top contenders, so if the Warriors don\u2019t win, then if the Lakers don\u2019t win, the Celtics will win. Moreover, it is most likely the Lakers will win and hence that the Warriors won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the Lakers don\u2019t win, the Celtics will?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

            "content": "Explanation: The given information states that the Lakers are the most likely to win, followed by the Warriors, with the Celtics having much lower odds. The statement also says that if the Warriors don\u2019t win, then if the Lakers don\u2019t win, the Celtics will win. However, the likelihood of the Lakers not winning and the Celtics winning instead is not directly addressed. The key point is that the Celtics have much lower odds compared to both the Lakers and the Warriors. Therefore, even if the Lakers don\u2019t win, it is still more likely that the Warriors would win before the Celtics, based on the odds provided.\n\nAnswer: no"
