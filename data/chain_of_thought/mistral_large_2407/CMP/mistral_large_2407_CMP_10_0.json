    "user_prompt": "Suppose that spring, summer, and winter are the most popular travel seasons. Forecasts show it's likely most vacations this year will happen in spring, followed closely by summer, with many fewer happening in the winter. These are by far the top seasons, so if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will. Moreover, spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

            "content": "Explanation: The given information states that spring is likely to have the most travelers, followed closely by summer, with winter having many fewer. This implies that the likelihood of spring having the most vacations is high, and the likelihood of summer having the most is lower, with winter being the least likely. The statement also mentions that if spring doesn't have the most vacations, then winter will only if summer doesn't. However, since it's given that spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't, we can deduce that if spring doesn't have the most vacations, it's not necessarily likely that winter will, because the likelihood of summer having the most is still higher than winter.\n\nAnswer: no"
