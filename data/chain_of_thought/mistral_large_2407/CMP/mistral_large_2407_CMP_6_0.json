    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, and Beyonce have the top-selling albums this year. Industry experts project it's likely Taylor Swift's album will sell the most copies, followed closely by Bad Bunny's, with Beyonce's album far behind. These are the only top-sellers, so if Bad Bunny\u2019s album doesn\u2019t sell the most copies, then if Taylor Swift\u2019s doesn\u2019t, Beyonce\u2019s will. Moreover, Taylor Swift\u2019s likely will sell the most and hence Bad Bunny's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will?",

            "content": "Explanation: The given information states that Taylor Swift's album is projected to sell the most, with Bad Bunny's closely following, and Beyonce's far behind. This implies a likely order of Taylor Swift > Bad Bunny > Beyonce in terms of sales. The statement also mentions that if Taylor Swift's album doesn't sell the most, then Beyonce's will only if Bad Bunny's also doesn't. However, since it's projected that Taylor Swift's likely will sell the most, and Bad Bunny's likely won't, this doesn't necessarily mean that Beyonce's album is likely to sell the most if Taylor Swift's doesn't. The projection still puts Bad Bunny's album closer to the top than Beyonce's. Therefore, it doesn't follow that it's likely that Beyonce's album will sell the most if Taylor Swift's doesn't.\n\nAnswer: no"
