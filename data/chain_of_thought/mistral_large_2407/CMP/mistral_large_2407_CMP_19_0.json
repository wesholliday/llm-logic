    "user_prompt": "Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don\u2019t increase the most, then if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won\u2019t increase the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

            "content": "Explanation: The given information states that economists project rents to increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. This establishes an expected order of increase: rents > home prices > mortgage rates. The statement then presents a hypothetical scenario where if home prices don\u2019t increase the most, and if rents don\u2019t increase the most, then mortgage rates will increase the most. However, it is also stated that rents likely will increase the most, making the condition \"if rents don\u2019t increase the most\" unlikely. Therefore, the scenario where mortgage rates would increase the most is not likely to occur based on the given projections.\n\nAnswer: no"
