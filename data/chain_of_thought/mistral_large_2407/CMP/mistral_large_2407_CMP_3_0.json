    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Spain, Brazil, and England have the best chances to win the World Cup. Based on betting odds, it is most likely Spain will win, followed closely by Brazil, with England having much lower odds. These teams have the only realistic chances, so if Brazil doesn\u2019t win, then if Spain doesn\u2019t win, England will win. Moreover, it is likely Spain will win and hence that Brazil won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Spain doesn\u2019t win, England will?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

            "content": "Explanation: The given information tells us that Spain has the highest probability of winning the World Cup, followed by Brazil, with England having a much lower chance. The statement \"if Brazil doesn\u2019t win, then if Spain doesn\u2019t win, England will win\" suggests that if the top two favorites are out, England is the next in line. However, the likelihood of Spain not winning and England winning depends on the specific probabilities, which are not provided. The phrase \"it is likely Spain will win and hence that Brazil won\u2019t win\" does not necessarily mean that England's chances increase significantly if Spain does not win, as England's odds are much lower to begin with. Therefore, without specific probabilities, we cannot conclude that it is likely that England will win if Spain does not.\n\nAnswer: no"
