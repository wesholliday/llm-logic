    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the stock market, real estate market, and bond market are the primary investment vehicles. According to financial advisors, the stock market likely will see the highest returns this year, followed by real estate, with bonds having significantly lower expected returns. These markets offer the best investment options, so if real estate doesn\u2019t have the highest returns, then if stocks don\u2019t, bonds will. Moreover, stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if stocks don\u2019t have the highest returns, bonds will?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

            "content": "Explanation: The statement provides a hierarchy of expected returns: stocks are likely to have the highest returns, followed by real estate, with bonds having significantly lower expected returns. It also states that if real estate doesn\u2019t have the highest returns, then if stocks don\u2019t, bonds will. Since it's given that stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won\u2019t, we can deduce that if stocks don't have the highest returns (which is less likely but possible), the only remaining option with the highest returns would be bonds, according to the given conditions.\n\nAnswer: yes"
