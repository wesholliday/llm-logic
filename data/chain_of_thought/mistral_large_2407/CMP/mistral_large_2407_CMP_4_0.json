    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it\u2019s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn\u2019t get the offer, then if Priya doesn\u2019t, Diego will. Moreover, it\u2019s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn\u2019t get the offer, Diego will?",

            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"it\u2019s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won\u2019t\" implies a high probability for Priya and a lower one for Julian. However, it does not directly inform us about Diego's chances when Priya is out of the picture. The information given only tells us the order of likelihood (Priya > Julian > Diego), not the exact probabilities. Therefore, we cannot conclude that it is likely that Diego will get the offer if Priya doesn't, as Diego could still be a longshot even when Priya is out of the running.\n\nAnswer: no"
