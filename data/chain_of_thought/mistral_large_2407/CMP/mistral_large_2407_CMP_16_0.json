    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the main transportation options in a city. According to ridership data, Uber likely will have the most rides this month, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer rides. These are the only major transportation providers, so if Lyft doesn\u2019t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn\u2019t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides. Moreover, Uber likely will give the most rides and hence Lyft likely won\u2019t give the most rides. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Uber doesn\u2019t give the most rides, taxis will?",

            "content": "Explanation: The statement provides a hierarchy of ridership popularity: Uber is most likely to have the most rides, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer rides. It also states that if both Uber and Lyft don't have the most rides, then taxis will. However, the statement also asserts that Uber is likely to have the most rides, making the scenario where taxis have the most rides less likely. Therefore, it does not follow that it's likely that if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will, because the initial assumption is that Uber is likely to have the most rides, not taxis.\n\nAnswer: no"
