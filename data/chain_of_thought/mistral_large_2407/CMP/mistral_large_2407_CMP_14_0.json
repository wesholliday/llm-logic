    "user_prompt": "Suppose that increases to minimum wage, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness are the most likely new laws. Only one new law will be passed this session. Congress watchers expect a minimum wage hike is most probable, followed by paid family leave, with loan forgiveness being much less likely. These are the only likely new laws, so if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen. Moreover, a minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen. Does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?",

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

            "content": "Explanation: We are given that the likelihood of the laws being passed is as follows: minimum wage hike > paid family leave > student loan forgiveness. It's also stated that if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, then if paid leave doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen. We are told that a minimum wage hike is likely, and thus paid leave is unlikely. If a minimum wage hike doesn't happen (which is unlikely), we would then look to the next most likely option, which is paid family leave. Only if both of those don't happen (which is even more unlikely) would we consider loan forgiveness. Therefore, it's not likely that if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will, because paid family leave is still more likely to happen before loan forgiveness.\n\nAnswer: no"
