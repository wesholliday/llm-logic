    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Ford, Toyota, and Honda lead US auto sales. Industry analysis expects Ford will sell the most vehicles this year, followed closely by Toyota, with Honda lagging significantly behind. These brands lead the market, so if Toyota isn\u2019t #1 in sales, then if Ford isn\u2019t, Honda will be. Moreover, Ford likely will lead in sales and hence Toyota likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Ford doesn\u2019t lead in sales, Honda will?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

            "content": "Explanation: The statement gives us a hierarchy of expected sales: Ford is expected to lead, followed closely by Toyota, with Honda significantly behind. It also tells us that if Ford doesn't lead, then either Toyota or Honda will. However, since Toyota is expected to be a close second to Ford, it's more likely that Toyota would take the lead if Ford doesn't, rather than Honda, which is expected to lag significantly behind. Therefore, it does not follow that if Ford doesn't lead in sales, Honda will.\n\nAnswer: no"
