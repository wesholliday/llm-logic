    "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it\u2019s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be. Moreover, it\u2019s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",

            "content": "Explanation: The given information tells us that apples are likely to be the top-selling fruit, followed by bananas, with oranges trailing behind. This implies that the likelihood of oranges being the top-selling fruit is low. The statement \"if bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be\" is a conditional statement that doesn't change the initial likelihoods. The crucial point is that the initial information already suggests that oranges are not likely to be the top-selling fruit. Therefore, even if apples aren't the top-selling fruit, the likelihood of oranges being the top-selling fruit remains low, as bananas would still be more likely to take the top spot.\n\nAnswer: no"
