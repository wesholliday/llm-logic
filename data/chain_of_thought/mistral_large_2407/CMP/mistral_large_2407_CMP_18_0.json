    "user_prompt": "Suppose that pizza, burgers, and tacos are the most frequently ordered takeout foods. According to restaurant data, pizza likely will be the top takeout item ordered, followed by burgers, with tacos ordered much less frequently. These foods lead takeout orders, so if burgers aren\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn\u2019t, tacos will be. Moreover, pizza likely will lead takeout orders and hence burgers likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if pizza isn\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be?",

            "content": "Explanation: The statement provides a hierarchy of the most frequently ordered takeout foods: pizza, burgers, and tacos, in that order. It also states that if burgers aren't the top item, then if pizza isn't either, tacos will be. However, the statement also mentions that pizza likely will lead takeout orders, making the scenario where pizza isn't the top item less likely. But we are asked to consider the conditional probability that if pizza isn't the top item, then tacos will be. Given the initial hierarchy and the condition that if both pizza and burgers aren't the top item, tacos will be, it follows that in the less likely scenario where pizza isn't the top item, tacos would indeed be the top item, as burgers are less frequent than pizza and this scenario implies burgers are also not the top item.\n\nAnswer: yes"
