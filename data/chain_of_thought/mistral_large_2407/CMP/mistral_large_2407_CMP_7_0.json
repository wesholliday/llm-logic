    "user_prompt": "Suppose that tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources. Forecasts indicate it\u2019s likely tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. These are the only major sources, so if solar power doesn\u2019t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn\u2019t, wind power will. Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?",

            "content": "Explanation: The given information presents a hierarchy of likely electricity generation from renewable sources: tidal power is expected to generate the most, followed by solar power, with wind power being the least. The statement also includes a conditional that if tidal power doesn't generate the most, then either solar or wind power will. However, since it's given that tidal power likely will generate the most, and solar power likely won't, we are left to consider the scenario where tidal power unexpectedly doesn't generate the most. In this case, since solar is also not likely to generate the most, the only remaining option is wind power. Therefore, it does follow that if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power likely will.\n\nAnswer: yes"
