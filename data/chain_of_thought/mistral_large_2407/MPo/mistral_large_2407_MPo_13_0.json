            "content": "Explanation: The given information presents us with a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" We are also given the fact that \"The car was red.\" In logic, if the condition (the car being red) is true, then the consequence (the truck being blue) must also be true. This is known as modus ponens, a form of argument that affirms the antecedent (the \"if\" part) to conclude the consequent (the \"then\" part).\n\nAnswer: yes"
