In this case, \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\")\n2. P (This is the statement we know to be true. In this case, \"Alex finished the race.\")\n3. Therefore, Q (This is the conclusion. In this case, \"Chris finished the race.\")\n\nGiven that Alex finishing the race is true, and the conditional statement is also true (that if Alex finished, then Chris finished), we can logically infer that Chris finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes"
