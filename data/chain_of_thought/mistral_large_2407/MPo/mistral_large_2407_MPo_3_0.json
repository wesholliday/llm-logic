In this scenario, \"P\" is \"The book was written by James,\" and \"Q\" is \"The book is a mystery novel.\" Given that \"P\" is true (The book was written by James) and the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is also true (If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel), we can indeed infer that \"Q\" is true (The book is a mystery novel).\n\nAnswer: yes"
