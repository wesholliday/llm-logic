We are told that \"The griffin was in the forest\" and that \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" In logic, this is a form of modus ponens, where if P implies Q and P is true, then Q must also be true. Here, P is \"The griffin was in the forest\" and Q is \"The unicorn was in the forest.\" Since we know P is true, we can infer that Q is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
