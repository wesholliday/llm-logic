In this case, \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\")\n2. P (This is the premise. Here, it's \"Joe went to the park.\")\n3. Therefore, Q (This is the conclusion. We can conclude that \"Lucy went to the zoo.\")\n\nGiven that Joe went to the park, and the condition that if Joe went to the park then Lucy went to the zoo, we can logically infer that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: yes"
