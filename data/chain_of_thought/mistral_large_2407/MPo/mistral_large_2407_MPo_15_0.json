            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\". Here, P is \"Sam took a plane\" and Q is \"Erin took a train\". We are given that P is true (\"Sam took a plane\"). According to the rules of inference in logic, specifically modus ponens, if P is true and \"If P, then Q\" is true, then we can conclude that Q is also true. Therefore, if \"Sam took a plane\" is true, then \"Erin took a train\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
