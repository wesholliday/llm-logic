If P, then Q (This is the conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\")\n2. P (This is the statement we know to be true: \"The bear was in the cave\")\n3. Therefore, Q (This is the conclusion we can draw: \"The wolf was in the den\")\n\nGiven that the bear was in the cave, and the rule that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf is in the den, we can logically conclude that the wolf was in the den.\n\nAnswer: yes"
