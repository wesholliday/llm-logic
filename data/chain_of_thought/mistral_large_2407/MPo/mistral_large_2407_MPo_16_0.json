If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n\nIn logic, this is a form of argument known as modus ponens, which follows the structure:\n\n- If P, then Q.\n- P is true.\n- Therefore, Q is true.\n\nIn this case, P is \"the shirt was cotton,\" and Q is \"the pants were denim.\" Since we know P is true (the shirt was cotton), we can infer that Q is also true (the pants were denim).\n\nAnswer: yes."
