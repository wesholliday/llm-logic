The fact is \"The apple was red.\" The conditional statement is \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" In logic, if we have a statement of the form \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, then we can conclude that Q is also true. This is known as modus ponens. In this case, P is \"The apple was red,\" and Q is \"The banana was yellow.\" Since we know that P is true (the apple was red), we can infer that Q is true (the banana was yellow).\n\nAnswer: yes"
