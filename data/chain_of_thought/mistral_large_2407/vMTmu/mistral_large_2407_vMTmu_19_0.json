If P, then Q.\n2. Not-Q.\n3. Therefore, not-P.\n\nIn this case, the argument can be rephrased to fit this structure:\n\n1. If Tom watched football (P), then Jen must have watched basketball (Q).\n2. It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball (Not-Q).\n3. Therefore, Tom did not watch football (Not-P).\n\nSince the argument follows the form of modus tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes."
