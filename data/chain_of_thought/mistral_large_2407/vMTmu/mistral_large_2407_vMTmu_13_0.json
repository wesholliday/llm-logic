If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, the argument can be rephrased as:\n\n1. If the car was red (P), then the truck must have been blue (Q).\n2. It's not the case that the truck must have been blue (Not Q).\n3. Therefore, the car was not red (Not P).\n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens structure, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
