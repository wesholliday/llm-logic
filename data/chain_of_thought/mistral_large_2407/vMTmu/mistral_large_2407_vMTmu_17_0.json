If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, the argument can be rephrased to fit this structure:\n\n1. If Ben ate pasta (P), then Kate must have eaten salad (Q).\n2. It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad (Not Q).\n3. Therefore, Ben did not eat pasta (Not P).\n\nSince the argument follows the structure of modus tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes."
