If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, the argument can be rephrased as:\n\n1. If Joe went to the park (P), then Lucy must have gone to the zoo (Q).\n2. It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo (Not Q).\n3. Therefore, Joe did not go to the park (Not P).\n\nThis argument follows the modus tollens structure perfectly, which means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes."
