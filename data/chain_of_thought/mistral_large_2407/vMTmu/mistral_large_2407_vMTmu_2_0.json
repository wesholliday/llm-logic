            "content": "Explanation: The given argument follows the form of a logical argument known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument. The structure of Modus Tollens is:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not-Q.\n3. Therefore, not-P.\n\nIn this case:\n- P is \"the griffin was in the forest\"\n- Q is \"the unicorn must have been in the forest\"\n\nThe argument states:\n1. If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\n2. It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\n3. Therefore, the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nThis fits the Modus Tollens structure perfectly, and since Modus Tollens is a logically valid form of argument, the given argument is also logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes."
