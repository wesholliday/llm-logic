If P, then Q (If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race)\n2. Not-Q (It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race)\n3. Therefore, not-P (Alex did not finish the race)\n\nIn modus tollens, if the first premise is true (P implies Q) and the second premise is true (not-Q), then the conclusion must be true (not-P). This form of argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
