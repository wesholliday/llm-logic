If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, the argument can be rephrased to fit this structure:\n\n1. If Jeff played basketball (P), then Amy must have played tennis (Q).\n2. It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis (Not Q).\n3. Therefore, Jeff did not play basketball (Not P).\n\nSince the argument follows the structure of modus tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes."
