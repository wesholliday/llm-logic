The structure of a modus tollens argument is as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not-Q.\n3. Therefore, not-P.\n\nIn this case, the argument can be rephrased as:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake (P), then the mummy must have been awake (Q).\n2. It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake (Not-Q).\n3. Therefore, the vampire was not awake (Not-P).\n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens structure, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes."
