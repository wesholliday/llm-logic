If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, the argument can be rephrased as:\n\n1. If the cake was chocolate (P), then the muffins must have been blueberry (Q).\n2. It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry (Not Q).\n3. Therefore, the cake was not chocolate (Not P).\n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens structure, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
