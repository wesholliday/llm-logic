If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, the argument can be rephrased as:\n\n1. If the dog was inside (P), then the cat must have been outside (Q).\n2. It's not the case that the cat must have been outside (Not Q).\n3. Therefore, the dog was not inside (Not P).\n\nThis argument is logically valid because the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. If the second premise (Not Q) is true, then the first premise (If P, then Q) implies that P cannot be true.\n\nAnswer: yes."
