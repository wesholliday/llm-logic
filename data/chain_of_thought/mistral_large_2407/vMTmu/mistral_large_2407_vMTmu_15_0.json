If P, then Q.\n2. Not-Q.\n3. Therefore, not-P.\n\nIn this case, the argument can be translated into this structure:\n\n1. If Sam took a plane (P), then Erin must have taken a train (Q).\n2. It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train (Not-Q).\n3. Therefore, Sam did not take a plane (Not-P).\n\nSince the argument follows the structure of modus tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes."
