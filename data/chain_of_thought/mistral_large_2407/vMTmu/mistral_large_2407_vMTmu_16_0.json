Not-Q.\n3. Therefore, not-P.\n\nIn this case, the argument can be rephrased as:\n\n1. If the shirt was cotton (P), then the pants must have been denim (Q).\n2. It's not the case that the pants must have been denim (Not-Q).\n3. Therefore, the shirt was not cotton (Not-P).\n\nThis argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. If the second premise (Not-Q) is true, then the first premise (If P, then Q) implies that P must be false. Therefore, the conclusion (Not-P) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes."
