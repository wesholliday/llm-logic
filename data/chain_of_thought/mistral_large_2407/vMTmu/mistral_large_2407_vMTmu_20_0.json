Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, the argument can be rephrased as:\n\n1. If the apple was red (P), then the banana must have been yellow (Q).\n2. It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow (Not Q).\n3. Therefore, the apple was not red (Not P).\n\nThis argument follows the modus tollens structure perfectly, so it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes."
