If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case:\n- P is \"the doll was plastic.\"\n- Q is \"the truck must have been metal.\"\n\nThe argument states:\n1. If the doll was plastic (P), then the truck must have been metal (Q).\n2. It's not the case that the truck must have been metal (Not Q).\n3. Therefore, the doll was not plastic (Not P).\n\nThis matches the structure of modus tollens, which is a logically valid form of argument.\n\nAnswer: yes."
