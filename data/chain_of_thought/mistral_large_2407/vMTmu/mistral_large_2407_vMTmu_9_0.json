If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, the argument can be rephrased to fit this structure:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt (P), then Mark must have bought the blue shirt (Q).\n2. It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt (Not Q).\n3. Therefore, Lisa did not buy the red shirt (Not P).\n\nSince the argument follows the structure of modus tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
