If P, then Q.\n2. Not-Q.\n3. Therefore, not-P.\n\nIn this case, the argument can be rephrased as:\n\n1. If the book was written by James (P), then the book must be a mystery novel (Q).\n2. It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel (Not-Q).\n3. Therefore, the book was not written by James (Not-P).\n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens structure, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes."
