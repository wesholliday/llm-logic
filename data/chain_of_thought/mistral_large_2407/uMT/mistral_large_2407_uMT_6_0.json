Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. However, the second statement tells us that Bob did not choose pasta. Therefore, since Bob did not choose pasta, it contradicts the condition that would be true if Sue chose pizza. Hence, we can conclude that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes"
