The unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nUsing the first statement, if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn would also have to be in the forest. However, according to the second statement, the unicorn was not in the forest. Therefore, since the unicorn's absence contradicts the consequence of the griffin being in the forest, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes"
