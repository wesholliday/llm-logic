The mummy was not awake.\n\nUsing these statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If the vampire was awake, then according to the first statement, the mummy would also be awake.\n- However, we know from the second statement that the mummy was not awake.\n- Therefore, the vampire cannot have been awake, because this would contradict the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
