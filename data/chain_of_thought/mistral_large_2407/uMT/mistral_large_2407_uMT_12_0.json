However, we are also told that \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\" If Joe had gone to the park, then Lucy would have gone to the zoo, which contradicts the information that Lucy did not go to the zoo. Therefore, the only way to resolve this without contradiction is to conclude that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes"
