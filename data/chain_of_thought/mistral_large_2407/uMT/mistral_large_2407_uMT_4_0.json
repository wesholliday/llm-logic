The robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nUsing these statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If the alien had visited Mars, then according to the first statement, the robot would have visited Jupiter.\n- However, we know from the second statement that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n- Therefore, the alien could not have visited Mars, because if it had, it would contradict the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes."
