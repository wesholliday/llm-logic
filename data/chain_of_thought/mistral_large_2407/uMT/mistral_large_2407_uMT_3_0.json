(This can be written as: James wrote the book \u2192 The book is a mystery novel)\n2. The book is not a mystery novel.\n\nUsing the logical reasoning form known as modus tollens, if the consequent (the book is a mystery novel) is false, then the antecedent (James wrote the book) must also be false. Therefore, if the book is not a mystery novel, then it cannot have been written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes"
