The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" So, the contrapositive of \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\" Given that the muffins were not blueberry, according to the contrapositive, we can indeed infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes"
