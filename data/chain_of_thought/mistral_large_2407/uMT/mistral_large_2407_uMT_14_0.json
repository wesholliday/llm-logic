The wolf was not in the den.\n\nUsing these statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If the bear was in the cave, then according to the first statement, the wolf would have been in the den.\n- However, we know from the second statement that the wolf was not in the den.\n- Therefore, the bear could not have been in the cave, because if it were, it would contradict the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
