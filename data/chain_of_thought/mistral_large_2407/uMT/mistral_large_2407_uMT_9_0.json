However, we are told that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. If Lisa had bought the red shirt, then according to the first statement, Mark would have had to buy the blue shirt. Since Mark did not buy the blue shirt, it contradicts the condition for Lisa buying the red shirt. Therefore, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes"
