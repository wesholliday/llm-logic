Erin did not take a train.\n\nUsing the first statement, if Sam had taken a plane, then Erin would have taken a train. However, according to the second statement, Erin did not take a train. Therefore, since the second part of the first statement (Erin taking a train) is false, the first part (Sam taking a plane) must also be false. This is an example of modus tollens in logic.\n\nAnswer: yes"
