The truck was not metal.\n\nTo determine if the doll was not plastic, we can use the contrapositive of the first statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" So, the contrapositive of the first statement is \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\"\n\nSince we know from the second statement that the truck was not metal, we can apply the contrapositive and conclude that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes"
