The pants were not denim.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know the pants were not denim. Now, let's consider the first statement. If the shirt was cotton, then according to the first statement, the pants would have to be denim. But we know the pants are not denim. Therefore, the shirt cannot be cotton, because that would contradict the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes."
