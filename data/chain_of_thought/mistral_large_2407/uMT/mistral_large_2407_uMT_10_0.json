The cat was not outside.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the cat was not outside. Now, let's consider the first statement. If the dog being inside implies that the cat is outside, but we know the cat is not outside, then the dog could not have been inside to begin with. This is because if the dog were inside, it would contradict the fact that the cat is not outside.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: yes"
