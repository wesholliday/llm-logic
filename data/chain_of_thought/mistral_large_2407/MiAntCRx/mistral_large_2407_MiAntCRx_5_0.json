However, it does not provide any information about the flimble having the property of being wobble. Since there is no information given about the flimble being wobble, we cannot infer that \"The flimble might be wobble and grooble.\" The inference would only be valid if it was stated that the flimble might also be wobble.\n\nAnswer: no"
