            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The zazzle might fizzle\" presents one possibility: that the zazzle may fizzle. The statement \"The zazzle might quibble and fizzle\" presents two possibilities: that the zazzle may quibble and that it may fizzle. If the zazzle might fizzle, it's possible that it might also quibble and then fizzle. The original statement doesn't exclude the possibility of the zazzle quibbling before it fizzles. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
