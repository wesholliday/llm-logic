            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The snork might be plimp\" suggests that there is a possibility that the snork has the property of being plimp. When we consider the statement \"The snork might be zibble and plimp,\" we are introducing an additional property, zibble, that the snork might also have. The use of the word \"might\" in both statements indicates that neither property is certain, but both are possible. Therefore, if the snork might be plimp, it is also possible that it might be both zibble and plimp, as the original statement does not exclude the possibility of additional properties.\n\nAnswer: yes"
