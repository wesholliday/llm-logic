The question asks if we can infer that \"The plonk might flimble and fizzle.\" To make this inference, we would need some indication that \"flimble\" is also a possibility. However, the original statement does not provide any information about \"flimble.\" Therefore, we cannot infer that the plonk might do both without additional information.\n\nAnswer: no"
