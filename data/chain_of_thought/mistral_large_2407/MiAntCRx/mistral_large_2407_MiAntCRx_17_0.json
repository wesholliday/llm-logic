However, it does not provide any information about whether the glorp might also be shimble. Since no information is given about the glorp being shimble, we cannot infer that \"The glorp might be shimble and bimboozle.\" We cannot add additional properties (like shimble) to the glorp without some basis for doing so.\n\nAnswer: no"
