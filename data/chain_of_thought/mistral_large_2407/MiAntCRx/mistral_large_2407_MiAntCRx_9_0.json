However, it does not provide any information about whether the flonk might also be quibble. Since there is no information given about the flonk being quibble, we cannot infer that \"The flonk might be quibble and frazzle.\" We cannot assume one possibility (quibble) based on another separate possibility (frazzle) without additional information.\n\nAnswer: no"
