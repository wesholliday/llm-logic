            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The flump might be wozzle\" indicates a possibility that the flump has the property of being wozzle. When we consider the statement \"The flump might be blurble and wozzle,\" this introduces an additional property, blurble, while still including the original property, wozzle. Since the original statement only specifies a possibility for wozzle and does not exclude the possibility of other properties like blurble, it is logically consistent to infer that the flump might also be both blurble and wozzle.\n\nAnswer: yes"
