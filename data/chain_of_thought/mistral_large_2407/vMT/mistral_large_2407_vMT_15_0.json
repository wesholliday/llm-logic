            "content": "Explanation: The given argument is a form of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument in logic. Modus tollens follows the structure: If P, then Q; Not-Q; Therefore, Not-P. In this case, let P be \"Sam took a plane\" and Q be \"Erin took a train\". The argument structure is: If Sam took a plane (P), then Erin took a train (Q); Erin did not take a train (Not-Q); Therefore, Sam did not take a plane (Not-P). This structure is logically valid because if the consequent (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes"
