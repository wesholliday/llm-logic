If P, then Q.\n2. Not-Q.\n3. Therefore, not-P.\n\nIn this case, the argument can be restructured to fit this form:\n\n1. If the shirt was cotton (P), then the pants were denim (Q).\n2. The pants were not denim (Not-Q).\n3. Therefore, the shirt was not cotton (Not-P).\n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens structure, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes."
