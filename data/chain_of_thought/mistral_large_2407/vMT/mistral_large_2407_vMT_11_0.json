Therefore, not-P.\n\nIn this case:\n1. If the cake was chocolate (P), then the muffins were blueberry (Q).\n2. The muffins were not blueberry (Not-Q).\n3. Therefore, the cake was not chocolate (Not-P).\n\nThis argument is logically valid because the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake could not have been chocolate, given the initial condition that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would have been blueberry.\n\nAnswer: yes."
