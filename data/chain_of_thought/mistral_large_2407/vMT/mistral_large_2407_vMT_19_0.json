            "content": "Explanation: The argument presented is a form of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. The structure of modus tollens is as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not-Q.\n3. Therefore, not-P.\n\nIn this case, the argument can be translated to:\n\n1. If Tom watched football (P), then Jen watched basketball (Q).\n2. Jen did not watch basketball (Not-Q).\n3. Therefore, Tom did not watch football (Not-P).\n\nThis argument is logically valid because the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. If the second premise (Jen did not watch basketball) is true, then the first premise (If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball) implies that Tom could not have watched football, as that would contradict the second premise.\n\nAnswer: yes."
