If P, then Q.\n2. Not-Q.\n3. Therefore, not-P.\n\nIn this case, let's replace P with \"the griffin was in the forest\" and Q with \"the unicorn was in the forest\":\n\n1. If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n2. The unicorn was not in the forest.\n3. Therefore, the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nThe argument follows the modus tollens structure perfectly, so if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. This makes the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes."
