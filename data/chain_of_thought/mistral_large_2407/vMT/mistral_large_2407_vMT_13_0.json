Not-Q.\n3. Therefore, not-P.\n\nIn this case, let P be \"the car was red\" and Q be \"the truck was blue\". The argument matches the modus tollens structure exactly:\n\n1. If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n2. The truck was not blue.\n3. Therefore, the car was not red.\n\nSince modus tollens is a logically valid form of argument, the given argument is also logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
