Not-Q.\n3. Therefore, not-P.\n\nIn this case, let P be \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q be \"Mark bought the blue shirt\". The argument follows the structure of modus tollens exactly:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. (If P, then Q.)\n2. Mark did not buy the blue shirt. (Not-Q.)\n3. Therefore, Lisa did not buy the red shirt. (Therefore, not-P.)\n\nSince the argument follows the form of modus tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes."
