(In this case, if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.)\n2. Not-Q. (The banana was not yellow.)\n3. Therefore, not-P. (The apple was not red.)\n\nIn modus tollens, if the condition (Q) is false, then the initial premise (P) must also be false. This is a logically valid form of argument.\n\nAnswer: yes."
