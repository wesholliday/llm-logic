If P, then Q.\n2. Not-Q.\n3. Therefore, not-P.\n\nIn this case, the argument can be rephrased to fit the modus tollens structure:\n\n1. If the dog was inside (P), then the cat was outside (Q).\n2. The cat was not outside (Not-Q).\n3. Therefore, the dog was not inside (Not-P).\n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens structure, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes."
