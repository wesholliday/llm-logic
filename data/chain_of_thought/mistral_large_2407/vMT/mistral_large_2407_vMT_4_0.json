If P, then Q.\n2. Not-Q.\n3. Therefore, not-P.\n\nIn this case, the argument can be rephrased to fit this structure:\n\n1. If the alien visited Mars (P), then the robot visited Jupiter (Q).\n2. The robot did not visit Jupiter (Not-Q).\n3. Therefore, the alien did not visit Mars (Not-P).\n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens structure correctly, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes."
