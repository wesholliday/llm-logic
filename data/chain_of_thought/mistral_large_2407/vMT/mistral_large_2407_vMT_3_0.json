            "content": "Explanation: The given argument follows the form of a modus tollens argument, which is a valid form of argument in logic. The structure of a modus tollens argument is as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not-Q.\n3. Therefore, not-P.\n\nIn this case, the argument can be rewritten as:\n\n1. If the book was written by James (P), then the book is a mystery novel (Q).\n2. The book is not a mystery novel (Not-Q).\n3. Therefore, the book was not written by James (Not-P).\n\nThis argument is logically valid because the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. If the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. The validity of the argument does not depend on the actual truth of the premises, but rather on the form of the argument.\n\nAnswer: yes."
