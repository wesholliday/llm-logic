If P, then Q.\n2. Not-Q.\n3. Therefore, not-P.\n\nIn this case, the argument can be restructured to fit the modus tollens form:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding (P), then Sue was at the wedding (Q).\n2. Sue was not at the wedding (Not-Q).\n3. Therefore, Mary was not at the wedding (Not-P).\n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens structure, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes."
