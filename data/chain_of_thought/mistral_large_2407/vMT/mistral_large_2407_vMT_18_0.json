If P, then Q (If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal)\n2. Not-Q (The truck was not metal)\n3. Therefore, Not-P (The doll was not plastic)\n\nIn modus tollens, if the first premise is true (P implies Q) and the second premise is true (Not-Q), then the conclusion (Not-P) must be true. This means that if the truck was not metal, then it cannot be the case that the doll was plastic (because if the doll were plastic, the truck would have been metal, according to the first premise).\n\nAnswer: yes"
