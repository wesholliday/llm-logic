If P, then Q.\n2. Not-Q.\n3. Therefore, not-P.\n\nIn this case, the argument can be rephrased as:\n\n1. If Sue chose pizza (P), then Bob chose pasta (Q).\n2. Bob did not choose pasta (Not-Q).\n3. Therefore, Sue did not choose pizza (Not-P).\n\nThis argument is logically valid because the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. If the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes."
