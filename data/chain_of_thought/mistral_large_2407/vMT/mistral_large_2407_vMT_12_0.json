(In this case, if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.)\n2. Not-Q. (Lucy did not go to the zoo.)\n3. Therefore, not-P. (Joe did not go to the park.)\n\nIn modus tollens, if the first premise is true (P implies Q), and the second premise is true (Q is false), then the conclusion must be true (P is false). This is a logically valid form of argument.\n\nAnswer: yes."
