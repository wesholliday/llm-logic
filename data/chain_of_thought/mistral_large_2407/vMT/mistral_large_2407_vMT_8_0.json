If P, then Q.\n2. Not-Q.\n3. Therefore, not-P.\n\nIn this case, the argument can be rephrased as:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake (P), then the mummy was awake (Q).\n2. The mummy was not awake (Not-Q).\n3. Therefore, the vampire was not awake (Not-P).\n\nThis argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. If the mummy being awake is a consequence of the vampire being awake, and we know the mummy was not awake, then it logically follows that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes."
