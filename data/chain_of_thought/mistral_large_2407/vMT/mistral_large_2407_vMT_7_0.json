If P, then Q.\n2. Not-Q.\n3. Therefore, not-P.\n\nIn this case, let P be \"Alex finished the race\" and Q be \"Chris finished the race\". The argument follows the structure of modus tollens exactly:\n\n1. If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. (If P, then Q)\n2. Chris did not finish the race. (Not-Q)\n3. Therefore, Alex did not finish the race. (Therefore, not-P)\n\nSince the argument follows the structure of modus tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
