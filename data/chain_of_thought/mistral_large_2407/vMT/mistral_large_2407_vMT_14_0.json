If P, then Q.\n2. Not-Q.\n3. Therefore, not-P.\n\nIn this case, let's replace P with \"the bear was in the cave\" and Q with \"the wolf was in the den\":\n\n1. If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n2. The wolf was not in the den.\n3. Therefore, the bear was not in the cave.\n\nGiven that the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. This is because if the second premise states that the wolf was not in the den, then according to the first premise, the bear could not have been in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes."
