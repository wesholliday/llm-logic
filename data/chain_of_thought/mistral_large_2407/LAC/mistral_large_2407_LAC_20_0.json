            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\". The second statement is \"The banana was yellow\", which is Q. The question asks if we can infer P (\"The apple was red\") from Q. In logic, inferring P from Q is known as affirming the consequent, which is a fallacy. Just because Q is true does not necessarily mean that P is true; there could be other reasons why the banana was yellow. Therefore, we cannot logically infer \"The apple was red\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
