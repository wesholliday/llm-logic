            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement that can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\" We are given that Q is true (\"The truck was blue\"), but we cannot logically infer P from this information alone. This is because P \u2192 Q does not imply Q \u2192 P. In other words, just because the truck is blue does not necessarily mean that the car is red; the car could be any color, and the truck could still be blue.\n\nAnswer: no"
