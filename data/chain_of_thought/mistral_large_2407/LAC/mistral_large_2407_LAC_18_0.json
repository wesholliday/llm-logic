            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is an example of a conditional statement in logic, which is of the form \"If P, then Q\". Here, P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal\". We are given that Q is true (\"The truck was metal\"), and we want to determine if P is true (\"The doll was plastic\").\n\nIn logical inference, if we know \"If P, then Q\" and Q is true, we cannot automatically conclude that P is true. This is because P might be false and Q could still be true due to some other reason. In other words, the truth of Q does not necessarily imply the truth of P.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot logically infer that \"The doll was plastic\".\n\nAnswer: no"
