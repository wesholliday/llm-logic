            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q.\" Here, P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt,\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" We are given that Q is true (\"Mark bought the blue shirt\"), and we want to determine if P is true (\"Lisa bought the red shirt\").\n\nIn logic, the truth of the consequent (Q) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (P). This is because \"If P, then Q\" only tells us that whenever P is true, Q is also true. It does not tell us anything about the situation when Q is true. Therefore, we cannot logically infer \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
