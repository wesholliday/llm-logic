We are given that Q is true ('Erin took a train'). In logic, if the consequent (Q) of an implication (P \u2192 Q) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (P) is true. This is because P \u2192 Q is also true when P is false and Q is true. Therefore, we cannot logically infer 'Sam took a plane' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
