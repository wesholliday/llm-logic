            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement that can be represented as \"Mary \u2192 Sue\". It means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was definitely there. However, it does not imply the reverse; that is, it does not guarantee that if Sue was at the wedding, Mary must have been there. The second statement is \"Sue was at the wedding\", but this does not provide any information about Mary's presence. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that Mary was at the wedding based solely on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
