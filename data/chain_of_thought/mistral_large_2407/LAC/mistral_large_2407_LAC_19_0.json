            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball\". The second statement is \"Jen watched basketball\", which is Q. The question asks if we can infer P from Q. In logic, inferring P from P \u2192 Q and Q is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. This is not a logically valid inference because Q can be true even if P is false. Therefore, we cannot logically infer \"Tom watched football\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
