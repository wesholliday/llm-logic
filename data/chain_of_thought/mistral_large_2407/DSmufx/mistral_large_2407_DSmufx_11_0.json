It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed.\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction (an \"or\" statement), which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true. The second statement negates the first condition of the disjunction. Therefore, if the flug is not zimmed, then according to the first statement, the only remaining option is that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes."
