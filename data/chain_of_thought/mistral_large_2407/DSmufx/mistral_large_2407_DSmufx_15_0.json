            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a logical disjunction and a negation. The first statement, \"Either the dreb must be spened or it is vroombed,\" can be represented as P or Q, where P is \"the dreb must be spened\" and Q is \"the dreb is vroombed.\" The second statement, \"It's not the case that the dreb must be spened,\" is the negation of P, represented as not P.\n\nIn logic, if we have a disjunction (P or Q) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false (not P), then we can infer that the other disjunct must be true (Q). This is known as the disjunctive syllogism.\n\nTherefore, if \"the dreb must be spened\" is false, then according to the first statement, \"the dreb is vroombed\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
