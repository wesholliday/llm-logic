The first statement is a disjunction: \"Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged.\" This means that at least one of these two conditions must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is a negation: \"It's not the case that the glip must be tragged.\" This means that the first condition (\"the glip must be tragged\") is false.\n\n3. If the first condition is false, then for the first statement to be true, the second condition (\"it is slogged\") must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The glip is slogged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
