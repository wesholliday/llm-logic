The first statement is \"Either the twonk must be varnished or it is plinked.\" This can be written in logical terms as \"P or Q,\" where P is \"the twonk must be varnished\" and Q is \"it is plinked.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the twonk must be plinked.\" This can be written as \"not Q.\"\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- We know that \"P or Q\" is true.\n- We also know that \"not Q\" is true, which means Q is false.\n\nIf Q is false, then for the statement \"P or Q\" to be true, P must be true. Therefore, \"the twonk must be varnished\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
