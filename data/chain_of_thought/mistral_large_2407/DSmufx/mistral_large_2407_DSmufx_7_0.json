According to the rules of logic, if we have \"P or Q\" and \"not P\", then we can infer \"Q\". In this case, \"P\" is \"the whiffle must be tinked\" and \"Q\" is \"the whiffle is shanked\". Since we are given \"not P\" (It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked), we can infer \"Q\" (The whiffle is shanked).\n\nAnswer: yes"
