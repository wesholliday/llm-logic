The first statement is a disjunction: \"Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed.\" This means that at least one of these conditions must be true.\n2. The second statement is a negation: \"It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped.\" This means that the first condition in the disjunction is false.\n3. If the first condition is false, then for the disjunction to hold true, the second condition must be true. Therefore, if the grommet is not plopped, it must be sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
