According to the rules of logic, specifically the disjunctive syllogism, if we have \"A or B\" and \"Not A\", then we can infer \"B\". In this case, \"A\" is \"the wug must be garpled\" and \"B\" is \"the wug is sproinged\". Since we are given \"Not A\" (\"It's not the case that the wug must be garpled\"), we can infer \"B\" (\"The wug is sproinged\").\n\nAnswer: yes"
