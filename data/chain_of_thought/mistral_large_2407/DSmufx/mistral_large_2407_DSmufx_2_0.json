According to the rules of logic, specifically the disjunctive syllogism, if we have \"P or Q\" and \"not P\", then we can infer \"Q\". In this case, \"P\" is \"the wug must be bimmed\" and \"Q\" is \"the wug is flooped\". Since we are given \"not P\" (It's not the case that the wug must be bimmed), we can infer \"Q\" (The wug is flooped).\n\nAnswer: yes"
