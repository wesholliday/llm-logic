            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a disjunction (\"Either A or B\") and a negation (\"Not A\"). According to logical reasoning, if we have \"Either A or B\" and we know that \"A is not true\", then it must be the case that \"B is true\". In this scenario, \"A\" is \"the fleeg must be surned\" and \"B\" is \"it is bluttered\". Since we are given that \"It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned\" (i.e., \"A is not true\"), we can infer that \"B\" is true, which means \"The fleeg is bluttered\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
