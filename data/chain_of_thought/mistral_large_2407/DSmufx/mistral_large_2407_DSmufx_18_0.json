            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a disjunction (either/or) and a negation. The first statement, \"Either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked,\" can be written logically as P or Q, where P is \"the shank must be nugged\" and Q is \"the shank is plooked.\" The second statement, \"It's not the case that the shank must be nugged,\" is the negation of P, written as not P.\n\nIn logic, if we have a disjunction (P or Q) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false (not P), then we can infer that the other disjunct must be true (Q). This is known as the disjunctive syllogism.\n\nSo, if \"the shank must be nugged\" is false, then according to the first statement, \"the shank is plooked\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
