According to logical reasoning, if we have \"Either P or Q\" and we know that \"Not P\" is true, then it must be the case that Q is true. In this scenario, let P be \"the sneg must be sproted\" and Q be \"it is crampled\". We are given that P is false (\"It's not the case that the sneg must be sproted\"), so we can conclude that Q is true (\"The sneg is crampled\").\n\nAnswer: yes"
