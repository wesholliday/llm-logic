According to logical reasoning, if we have \"Either A or B\" and we know that \"A\" is false, then \"B\" must be true. In this case, \"A\" is \"the smip must be lupped\" and \"B\" is \"the smip is shripped\". Since it's given that \"the smip must be lupped\" is not the case, we can infer that \"the smip is shripped\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
