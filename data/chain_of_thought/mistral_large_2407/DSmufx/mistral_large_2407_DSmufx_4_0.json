            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a logical disjunction and a negation. The first statement, \"Either the fribble must be crinked or it is snurgled,\" can be represented as P or Q, where P is \"the fribble must be crinked\" and Q is \"the fribble is snurgled.\" The second statement, \"It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked,\" is the negation of P, represented as not P.\n\nIn logic, if we have a disjunction (P or Q) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false (not P), then we can infer that the other disjunct must be true (Q). This is known as the disjunctive syllogism.\n\nTherefore, if \"the fribble must be crinked\" is false, then according to the first statement, \"the fribble is snurgled\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
