According to logical reasoning, if we have \"P or Q\" and \"not P\", then we can infer \"Q\". In this case, let P be \"the splat must be quanked\" and Q be \"the splat is morphed\". We are given \"Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed\" (P or Q) and \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked\" (not P). Therefore, we can logically infer \"The splat is morphed\" (Q).\n\nAnswer: yes"
