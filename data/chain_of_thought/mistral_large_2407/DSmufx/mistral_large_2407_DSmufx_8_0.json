The first statement is a disjunction: \"Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked.\" This means that at least one of these conditions must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is a negation: \"It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled.\" This means that the sprocket is not daggled.\n\n3. If the sprocket is not daggled, then according to the first statement, the only remaining option is that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nTherefore, based on these two statements, we can infer that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
