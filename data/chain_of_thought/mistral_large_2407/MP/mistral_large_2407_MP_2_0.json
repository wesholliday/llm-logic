            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a logical implication and a fact. The first statement, \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest,\" can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the griffin was in the forest\" and Q is \"the unicorn was in the forest.\" The second statement asserts that P is true. In logic, if P is true and P \u2192 Q is true, then Q must also be true. This is known as modus ponens in logical reasoning. Therefore, if the griffin was indeed in the forest, then according to the given implication, the unicorn must also have been in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes"
