            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement. It sets up a condition (the car being red) and a consequence (the truck being blue). The second statement, \"The car was red,\" fulfills the condition set by the first statement. Therefore, according to the rules of logical inference, specifically modus ponens, we can conclude that the consequence must also be true, which is \"The truck was blue.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
