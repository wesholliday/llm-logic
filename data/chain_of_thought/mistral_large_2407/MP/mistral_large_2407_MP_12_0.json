It means that if the condition \"Joe went to the park\" is true, then the conclusion \"Lucy went to the zoo\" must also be true. Given that we are told \"Joe went to the park,\" we can apply this information to the conditional statement. Since the condition is met, the conclusion follows. Therefore, we can infer that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: yes"
