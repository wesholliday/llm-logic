            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\". Here, P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins were blueberry\". The second statement \"The cake was chocolate\" affirms P. According to modus ponens, a valid form of argument in logic, if P is true and \"If P, then Q\" is true, then Q must also be true. Therefore, if the cake was indeed chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nAnswer: yes"
