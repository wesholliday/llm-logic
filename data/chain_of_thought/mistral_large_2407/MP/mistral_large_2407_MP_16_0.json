If P, then Q (In this case, \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\")\n2. P (In this case, \"The shirt was cotton\")\n3. Therefore, Q (We can conclude \"The pants were denim\")\n\nSo, if the shirt being cotton implies the pants are denim, and we know the shirt is indeed cotton, then we can logically infer that the pants are denim.\n\nAnswer: yes"
