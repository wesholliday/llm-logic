            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' is a conditional statement. It means that if the condition 'Tom watched football' is true, then the conclusion 'Jen watched basketball' must also be true. Given that we are also told 'Tom watched football', we can apply the rule of Modus Ponens, which allows us to infer the conclusion of a conditional statement when its condition is true. Therefore, we can indeed infer that 'Jen watched basketball'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
