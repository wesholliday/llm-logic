            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\". Here, P is \"Alex finished the race\" and Q is \"Chris finished the race\". The second statement \"Alex finished the race\" confirms that P is true. In logic, if P is true in a \"If P, then Q\" statement, then Q must also be true. Therefore, if Alex finished the race, then it follows that Chris finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes"
