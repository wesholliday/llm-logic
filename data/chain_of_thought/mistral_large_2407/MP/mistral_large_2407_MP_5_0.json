            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis' is a conditional statement of the form 'If P, then Q'. Here, P is 'Jeff played basketball' and Q is 'Amy played tennis'. We are given that P is true ('Jeff played basketball'). According to the rules of inference in logic, specifically modus ponens, if P is true and 'If P, then Q' is true, then we can conclude that Q is also true. Therefore, if 'Jeff played basketball' is true, then 'Amy played tennis' must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
