            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement of the form 'If P, then Q', where P is 'Mary was at the wedding' and Q is 'Sue was at the wedding'. The second statement 'Mary was at the wedding' confirms that P is true. In logic, if the conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is true and P is true, then Q must also be true. Therefore, if Mary was at the wedding, then according to the given conditional statement, Sue must also have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes"
