The original statement does not provide any information about \"flimble a zibble.\" In logic, you cannot add new information or conditions unless they are implied by the original statement. Since the original statement does not imply or mention \"flimble a zibble,\" we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no"
