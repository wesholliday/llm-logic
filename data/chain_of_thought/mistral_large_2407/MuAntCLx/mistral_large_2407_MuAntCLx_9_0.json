It does not provide any information about the zazzle being \"flump\". To infer that \"The zazzle must be glorp and flump\", we would need additional information that links or equates \"glorp\" with \"flump\" or states that the zazzle is also \"flump\". Without such information, we cannot make the inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
