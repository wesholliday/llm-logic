It does not provide any information about \"quimble quibble\". To infer \"The snorkel must be in the wumble and quimble quibble\", we would need additional information that connects the snorkel or the wumble to \"quimble quibble\". Without such information, we cannot make the inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
