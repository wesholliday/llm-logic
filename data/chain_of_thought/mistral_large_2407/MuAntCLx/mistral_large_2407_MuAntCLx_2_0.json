The second statement, \"The bimboozle must be on the plonk and froodle a wobble quank,\" adds an additional condition. Logically, you cannot infer the second statement from the first because the first statement does not provide any information about \"froodling a wobble quank.\" In other words, the first statement does not imply or necessitate the additional condition in the second statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
