The premise is \"The vampire might not have been awake,\" which can be translated to \"It is possible that the vampire was not awake.\" The conclusion is \"It's not the case that the vampire must have been awake,\" which can be translated to \"It is not necessary that the vampire was awake.\" In modal logic, if it is possible that P (where P is \"the vampire was not awake\"), then it is not necessary that not P. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes"
