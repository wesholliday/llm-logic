            "content": "Explanation: The argument presented is in the form of a modal logic statement. The premise \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" can be translated to \"It is possible that Mary was not at the wedding.\" The conclusion \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" can be translated to \"It is not necessary that Mary was at the wedding.\" In modal logic, the statement \"possibly not P\" is equivalent to \"not necessarily P.\" Therefore, if the premise is true (that it is possible Mary was not at the wedding), then the conclusion must also be true (that it is not necessary that Mary was at the wedding). This makes the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
