P \u2192 Q (If the griffin must have been in the forest, then the griffin would have been in the forest)\n2. ~Q (The griffin might not have been in the forest)\n3. Therefore, ~P (It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest)\n\nIn modus tollens, if the consequent (Q) is false, then the premise (P) must also be false. In this case, if it's true that the griffin might not have been in the forest, then it cannot be the case that the griffin must have been in the forest. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
