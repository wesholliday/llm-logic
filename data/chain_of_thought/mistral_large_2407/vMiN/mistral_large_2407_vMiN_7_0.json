The premise \"Alex might not have finished the race\" can be interpreted as \"It is possible that Alex did not finish the race.\" The conclusion \"It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race\" negates the necessity of Alex finishing the race. In modal logic, if something is possibly not true, then it is not necessarily true. Therefore, if it is possible that Alex did not finish the race, it follows that it is not necessarily true that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes"
