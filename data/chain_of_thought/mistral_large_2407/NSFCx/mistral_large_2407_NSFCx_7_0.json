Therefore, we can break down the statement into two separate possibilities: \"The blimp might bimboozle the snork\" and \"The blimp might zizz the snork.\" Since the original statement allows for either or both to be true, we can indeed infer that \"The blimp might bimboozle the snork and the blimp might zizz the snork.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
