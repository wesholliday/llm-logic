The original statement specifies that the plonk must \"frozz floob gronk.\" The second statement adds additional conditions (\"blimple quibble frozz\") before the original condition. However, without additional context or definitions for these terms, we cannot logically deduce that the plonk must also \"blimple quibble frozz\" simply because it must \"frozz floob gronk.\" The additional conditions are not implied by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
