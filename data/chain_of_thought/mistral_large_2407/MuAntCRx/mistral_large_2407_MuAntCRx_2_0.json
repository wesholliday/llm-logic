The first statement requires the grazzle to perform one action: \"flump a bimboozle quazzle.\" The second statement requires the grazzle to perform two actions: \"glorp a zibble snizzle\" and \"flump a bimboozle quazzle.\" Since the second statement includes an additional action that is not mentioned in the first statement, we cannot infer the second statement from the first. The first statement does not provide any information about the grazzle needing to \"glorp a zibble snizzle.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
