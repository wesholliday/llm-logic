The first statement is \"The grooble must frazzle quibble wibble.\" The second statement is \"The grooble must snork wozzle grooble and frazzle quibble wibble.\" The second statement includes all the elements of the first statement but also includes additional elements (\"snork wozzle grooble\"). Since the second statement contains additional requirements that are not present in the first statement, we cannot infer the second statement from the first. The first statement does not provide any information about the \"snork wozzle grooble\" part.\n\nAnswer: no"
