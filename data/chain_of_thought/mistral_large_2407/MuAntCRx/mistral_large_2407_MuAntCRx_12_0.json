The original statement specifies only one condition: \"fizzle blimple.\" The inferred statement adds an additional condition: \"flump frazzle.\" Since the original statement does not provide any information about \"flump frazzle,\" we cannot logically infer the additional condition from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
