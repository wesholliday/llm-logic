The original statement specifies only that the wibble must \"wibble fribble zizz.\" The second statement includes additional actions (\"blimp zibble plimp\") that are not mentioned or implied in the original statement. Since the original statement does not provide any information about these additional actions, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no"
