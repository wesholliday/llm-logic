It does not mention or imply any additional conditions such as being \"frazzle by flibbit.\" To infer the second statement, we would need additional information that links \"frazzle by flibbit\" with the original condition, which is not provided. Therefore, we cannot logically infer \"The quazzle must be frazzle by flibbit and be flibbit by zizz\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
