The original statement specifies only one condition: \"The zazzle must be flonk a wumble.\" The inferred statement adds an additional condition: \"The zazzle must frozz a quimble.\" Since the original statement does not mention or imply anything about \"frozzing a quimble,\" we cannot logically infer the additional condition from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
