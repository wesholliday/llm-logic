The original statement is a conditional (if P, then Q), and we are given that Q is true. However, knowing that Q is true does not necessarily mean that P is true, as there could be other reasons why Q is true. In logical terms, we cannot infer the truth of the antecedent (P) from the truth of the consequent (Q) alone. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"The smonk was vreebled\" based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no"
