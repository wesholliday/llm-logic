            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled' implies that cranking the sprocket is a sufficient condition for the sprocket to be daggled. However, it does not imply that it is a necessary condition. In other words, the sprocket could be daggled due to other reasons besides being cranked. Therefore, from the fact that the sprocket was daggled, we cannot definitively conclude that it was cranked.\n\nAnswer: no"
