When we combine these two possibilities, we get a scenario where the scientist might be doing both at the same time\u2014that is, the scientist might be conducting an experiment in the lab. This inference logically follows from the original statement because if the scientist could be in the lab and could also be conducting an experiment, then it's possible that these two events are happening simultaneously.\n\nAnswer: yes"
