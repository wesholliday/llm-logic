            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The restaurant might be expensive and the restaurant might be busy\" presents two independent possibilities. It does not necessarily mean that both conditions will be true at the same time. The phrase \"might be\" indicates a possibility, not a certainty. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The restaurant might be expensive and busy\" because it is also possible that the restaurant might be expensive but not busy, or busy but not expensive.\n\nAnswer: no"
