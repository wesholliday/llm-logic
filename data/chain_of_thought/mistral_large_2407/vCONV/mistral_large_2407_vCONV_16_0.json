If P, then Q (If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim)\n2. Q (The pants were denim)\n3. Therefore, P (The shirt was cotton)\n\nThis form of argument is not logically valid because the truth of the consequent (Q) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (P). In other words, just because the pants were denim, it does not necessarily mean that the shirt was cotton; there could be other possibilities for the shirt's material.\n\nAnswer: no"
