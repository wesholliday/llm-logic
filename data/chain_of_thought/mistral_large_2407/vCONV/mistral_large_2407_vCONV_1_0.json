            "content": "Explanation: The given argument is a logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\" The premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding.\" The conclusion, however, incorrectly reverses this to say that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding (Q \u2192 P). In logic, P \u2192 Q does not imply Q \u2192 P. For example, if it's true that \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet,\" it doesn't mean that \"If the ground is wet, then it's raining.\" The ground could be wet due to other reasons. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
