            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow,\" which can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow.\" The conclusion is also a conditional statement but with the antecedent and consequent swapped: \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red,\" which can be represented as Q \u2192 P.\n\nIn logic, the truth of P \u2192 Q does not necessarily imply the truth of Q \u2192 P. For example, consider the statements \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\" (P \u2192 Q) and \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining\" (Q \u2192 P). The first statement is true, but the second statement can be false because the ground could be wet for other reasons (e.g., a sprinkler).\n\nTherefore, the argument form presented is not logically valid because the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
