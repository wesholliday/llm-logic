However, this does not mean that every mystery novel must have been written by James. There could be other authors who write mystery novels. Therefore, the conclusion that if the book is a mystery novel, then it was written by James, is not necessarily true. The argument is not logically valid because it does not follow a valid form of reasoning.\n\nAnswer: no"
