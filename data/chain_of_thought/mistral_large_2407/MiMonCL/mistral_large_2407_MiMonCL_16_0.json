            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The artwork might be authentic and worth millions\" is a compound statement combining two possibilities: that the artwork might be authentic, and that it might be worth millions. The use of the word \"and\" in this context does not exclude the possibility of each condition being true independently. Therefore, if the artwork might be both authentic and worth millions, it logically follows that it might be authentic.\n\nAnswer: yes"
