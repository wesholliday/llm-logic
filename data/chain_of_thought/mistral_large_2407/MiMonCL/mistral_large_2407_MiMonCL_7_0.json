            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The investment might be risky and offer high returns\" is a compound statement combining two independent clauses: \"The investment might be risky\" and \"offer high returns.\" In logic, if a compound statement connected by \"and\" is true, then each of its individual components must also be true. Therefore, if the entire statement is given, we can infer that each part, including \"The investment might be risky,\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
