            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The concert might be sold out and feature a famous band\" is a compound statement combining two possibilities: that the concert might be sold out and that it might feature a famous band. The use of the word \"and\" in this context does not imply that both conditions must be true simultaneously; rather, it suggests that each is a separate possibility. Therefore, from the given statement, we can indeed infer that \"The concert might be sold out\" as it is one of the possibilities mentioned.\n\nAnswer: yes"
