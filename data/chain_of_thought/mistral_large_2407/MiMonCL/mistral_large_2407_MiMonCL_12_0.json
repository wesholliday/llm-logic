            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The contract might be legally binding and have hidden clauses\" is a compound statement combining two possibilities: that the contract might be legally binding, and that it might have hidden clauses. The use of the word \"and\" in this context does not exclude the possibility that only one of the conditions is true. Therefore, if the contract might be legally binding and have hidden clauses, it logically follows that it might be legally binding, regardless of whether it has hidden clauses or not.\n\nAnswer: yes"
