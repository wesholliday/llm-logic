It does not provide any information about the budget of the project. The phrase \"and been under budget\" introduces a new condition that is not implied or mentioned in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that the project must have been both completed by Friday and under budget based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
