It does not provide any information about whether a signature was required or obtained. The phrase \"and signed for\" adds an additional condition that is not implied or mentioned in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that the package was both delivered and signed for based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
