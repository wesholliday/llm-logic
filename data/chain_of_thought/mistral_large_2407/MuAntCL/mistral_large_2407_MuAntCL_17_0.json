It does not provide any information about when the report was submitted. The phrase \"and been submitted by noon\" introduces a new condition that is not implied or required by the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that the report must have been submitted by noon based solely on the information that it must have been accurate.\n\nAnswer: no"
