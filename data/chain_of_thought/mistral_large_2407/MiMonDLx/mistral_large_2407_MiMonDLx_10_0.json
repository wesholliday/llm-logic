When we consider the statement \"The snork might be plonk or wobble,\" this includes the possibility that the snork is plonk, as well as the additional possibility that the snork is wobble. Since the original statement already allows for the snork to be plonk, it is logically included in the second statement which offers an additional option. Therefore, if the snork might be plonk, it can also be said that the snork might be plonk or wobble.\n\nAnswer: yes"
