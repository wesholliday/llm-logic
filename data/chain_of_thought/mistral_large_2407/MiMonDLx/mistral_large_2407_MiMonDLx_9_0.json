            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The frazzle might be wump\" suggests that there is a possibility that the frazzle is wump. When we consider the statement \"The frazzle might be wump or quimble,\" this statement suggests that there is a possibility that the frazzle is either wump or quimble. Since the original statement already allows for the possibility of the frazzle being wump, it does not exclude the additional possibility of it being quimble. Therefore, the original statement can indeed be expanded to include the additional possibility without contradiction.\n\nAnswer: yes"
