            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The zibble might be wozzle\" suggests that there is a possibility of the zibble being wozzle. When we consider the statement \"The zibble might be wozzle or snork,\" this includes the original possibility (that the zibble might be wozzle) and adds an additional possibility (that the zibble might be snork). Logically, if the zibble might be wozzle, then it is also true that the zibble might be wozzle or something else (in this case, snork). Therefore, the original statement implies the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
