            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The plimp might be wobble\" suggests that there is a possibility of the plimp being wobble. When we consider the statement \"The plimp might be wobble or blimple,\" this includes the original possibility (the plimp being wobble) and adds an additional possibility (the plimp being blimple). Since the original statement does not exclude the plimp being blimple, the inference is valid. In logical terms, if A is possible, then A or B is also possible.\n\nAnswer: yes"
