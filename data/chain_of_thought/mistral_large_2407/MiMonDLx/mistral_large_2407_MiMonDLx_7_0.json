            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The frazzle might be wozzle\" presents a possibility. When we consider the statement \"The frazzle might be wozzle or on flump,\" it includes the original possibility (\"The frazzle might be wozzle\") and adds an additional possibility (\"or on flump\"). Logically, if the first statement is true, then the second statement, which includes the first as one of its possibilities, must also be true. This is because the second statement does not exclude the first possibility but rather expands upon it.\n\nAnswer: yes"
