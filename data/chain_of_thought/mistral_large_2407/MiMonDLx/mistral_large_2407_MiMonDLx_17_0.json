            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The zibber might be wozzle flim\" suggests that there is a possibility of the zibber being wozzle flim. When we consider the statement \"The zibber might be wozzle flim or quibble frazzle fribble,\" this includes the original possibility (wozzle flim) and adds an additional possibility (quibble frazzle fribble). Since the original statement is already included in the second statement, we can indeed infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
