When we consider the statement \"The zibber might be froodle or on wibble,\" this includes the original possibility (that the zibber is froodle) and adds an additional possibility (that the zibber is on wibble). Since the original statement does not exclude the zibber being on wibble, the inference is valid. In logical terms, if P is possible, then P or Q is also possible.\n\nAnswer: yes"
