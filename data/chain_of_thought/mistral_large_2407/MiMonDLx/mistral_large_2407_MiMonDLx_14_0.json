When we consider the statement \"The zibble might snork frozz or be in flibbit wump,\" we are introducing an additional possibility. In logic, if one possibility is true, then adding another possibility with an \"or\" statement does not negate the original possibility. Therefore, if the zibble might snork frozz, it is also true that it might snork frozz or be in flibbit wump, because the first part of the \"or\" statement is already established as a possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes"
