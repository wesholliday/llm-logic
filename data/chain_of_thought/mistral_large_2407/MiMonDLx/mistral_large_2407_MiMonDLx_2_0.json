            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The blimple might be on the flump\" suggests that there is a possibility the blimple is located on the flump. When we consider the statement \"The blimple might be on the flump or in the wobble,\" this statement includes the original possibility (on the flump) and adds an additional possibility (in the wobble). Since the original statement does not exclude the blimple from being in other locations, adding another possible location (in the wobble) is a logical extension. Therefore, if the blimple might be on the flump, it can also be said that it might be on the flump or in the wobble.\n\nAnswer: yes"
