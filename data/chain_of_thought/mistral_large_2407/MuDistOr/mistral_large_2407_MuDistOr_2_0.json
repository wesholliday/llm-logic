            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The car must have been in the garage or at the repair shop\" suggests that the car could be in either of the two places, but it doesn't explicitly state that it must be in one or the other. The rephrased statement \"The car must have been in the garage or it must have been at the repair shop\" implies a stronger assertion that the car definitely was in one of the two locations. However, the logical structure of the sentence remains the same, as the use of \"or\" in both sentences implies that one of the two conditions is true. Therefore, the rephrased statement can be inferred from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
