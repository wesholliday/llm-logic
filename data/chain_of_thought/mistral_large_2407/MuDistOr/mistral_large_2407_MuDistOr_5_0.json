            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The meeting must have been on Monday or Tuesday\" suggests that the meeting occurred on one of those two days, but it does not specify which one. It leaves open the possibility that it could have been either day. The second statement \"The meeting must have been on Monday or it must have been on Tuesday\" also suggests that the meeting occurred on one of those two days, and it similarly does not specify which one. Therefore, the second statement is a logical equivalent of the first statement, just phrased differently.\n\nAnswer: yes"
