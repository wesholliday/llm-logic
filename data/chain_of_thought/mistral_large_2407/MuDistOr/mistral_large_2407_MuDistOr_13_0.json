            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The meal must have included a salad or soup\" implies that at least one of the two items (salad or soup) was part of the meal. This statement leaves open the possibility that either one or both were included. When we break it down into \"The meal must have included a salad or it must have included soup,\" we are essentially saying the same thing. The use of \"or\" in both statements indicates a non-exclusive disjunction, meaning it could be one, the other, or both. Therefore, the inference is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
