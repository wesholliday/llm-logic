This is a logical disjunction (OR) that doesn't exclude any of the possibilities. When we break it down into \"The contract must have been approved by the legal team or it must have been approved by the CEO,\" we are essentially restating the same condition with more words but not changing the logical structure or the meaning. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
