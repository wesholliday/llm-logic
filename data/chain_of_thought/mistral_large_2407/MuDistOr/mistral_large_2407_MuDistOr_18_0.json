            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The product must have been eco-friendly or recyclable\" suggests that the product has at least one of the two properties: it is either eco-friendly, recyclable, or both. When we break this down into \"The product must have been eco-friendly or it must have been recyclable,\" we are essentially saying the same thing. The use of \"or\" in both statements implies that at least one of the conditions must be true. Therefore, the inference is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
