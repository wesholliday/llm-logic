            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The document must have been signed or notarized\" suggests that at least one of the two conditions (signed or notarized) must be true. It does not specify that only one of the conditions must be true; it could be one or both. The rephrased statement \"The document must have been signed or it must have been notarized\" implies that only one of the conditions is necessary, which aligns with the original statement's meaning. Therefore, the rephrased statement can be inferred from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
