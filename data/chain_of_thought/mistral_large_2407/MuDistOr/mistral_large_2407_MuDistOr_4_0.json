            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The keys must have been in the drawer or on the hook\" suggests that there are two possible locations where the keys could have been. The phrase \"or\" in this context is used to indicate that the keys could be in one of the two places, not necessarily both. When we break it down into \"The keys must have been in the drawer or they must have been on the hook,\" we are essentially restating the same idea with a slight rephrasing. The meaning remains the same: the keys were either in the drawer or on the hook. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
