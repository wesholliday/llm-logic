            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package must have been delivered by truck or by plane\" implies that one of the two methods was used for delivery. The phrase \"by truck or by plane\" acts as a single combined condition for the delivery. When we break it down into \"The package must have been delivered by truck or it must have been delivered by plane,\" we are essentially saying the same thing, just in a more explicit manner. The logical structure remains the same, with the package having been delivered by one of the two methods. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
