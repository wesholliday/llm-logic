            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The building must have had an elevator or wheelchair ramps\" suggests that the building had at least one of these two features. When we break this down, it implies that the building either had an elevator, or it had wheelchair ramps, or it had both. The rephrased statement \"The building must have had an elevator or it must have had wheelchair ramps\" carries the same meaning. It also suggests that at least one of these two features was present in the building. Therefore, the rephrased statement can be inferred from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
