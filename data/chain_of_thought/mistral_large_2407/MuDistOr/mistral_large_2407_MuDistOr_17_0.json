When we break this down into \"The experiment must have been conducted in a lab or it must have been conducted in the field,\" we are essentially restating the same disjunction with slightly different phrasing. The logical structure remains the same, as it still indicates that the experiment was conducted in one of the two locations. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
