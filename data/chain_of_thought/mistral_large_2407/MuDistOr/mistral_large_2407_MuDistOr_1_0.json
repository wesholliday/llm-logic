            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The envelope must have been upstairs or under a bed\" suggests that the envelope could be in one of two places: upstairs or under a bed. The phrase \"or\" in this context is inclusive, meaning it covers both possibilities. When we rephrase it to \"The envelope must have been upstairs or it must have been under a bed,\" we are essentially breaking down the same inclusive \"or\" into two separate clauses, but the meaning remains the same. Both statements are saying that the envelope could be in one of two places, so the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
