When we break it down into \"The book must have been on the shelf or it must have been in the backpack,\" we are essentially saying the same thing. The phrase \"it must have been\" is simply repeated for each location, emphasizing that the book was definitely in one of these two places. This repetition does not change the meaning or the certainty of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
