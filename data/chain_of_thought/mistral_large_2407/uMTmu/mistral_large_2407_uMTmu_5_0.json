(This can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\")\n2. It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis. (This can be written as \u00acQ, where Q is \"Amy played tennis.\")\n\nNow, if Jeff had played basketball (P), then according to the first statement, Amy must have played tennis (Q). But we know from the second statement that Amy did not play tennis (\u00acQ). Therefore, since Amy did not play tennis, Jeff could not have played basketball, because if he had, Amy would have had to play tennis.\n\nAnswer: yes."
