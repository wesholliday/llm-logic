This is a conditional statement, which we can write as \"Plastic doll \u2192 Metal truck\".\n2. It's not the case that the truck must have been metal. This means that the truck could be made of any material, not necessarily metal.\n\nNow, let's use contraposition to infer the information about the doll. The contrapositive of the first statement is \"Not Metal truck \u2192 Not Plastic doll\".\n\nSince we know that it's not necessarily the case that the truck is metal, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes"
