            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down logically. We are given two statements:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. (This is a conditional statement, which we can write as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\")\n2. It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. (This is the negation of Q, which we can write as \u00acQ.)\n\nWe are asked to infer whether Lisa did not buy the red shirt. If Lisa had bought the red shirt (P), then according to the first statement, Mark must have bought the blue shirt (Q). But we know that's not the case (\u00acQ). Therefore, our assumption that Lisa bought the red shirt (P) must be false. So, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes"
