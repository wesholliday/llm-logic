It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the mummy was not necessarily awake. Now, let's consider the contrapositive of the first statement: If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake. Since we know that the mummy was not necessarily awake, we can infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes"
