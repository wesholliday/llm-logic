It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad. (\u00acS)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta (\u00acP).\n\nAccording to the first statement, if Ben ate pasta, then Kate eating salad is a necessity. However, the second statement tells us that Kate did not necessarily eat salad. Therefore, for both statements to be true, Ben cannot have eaten pasta, because if he had, it would make the second statement false.\n\nAnswer: yes"
