It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the truck could be any color other than necessarily blue. Now, let's consider the first statement. If the car being red necessitates the truck being blue, but we know the truck doesn't have to be blue, then the car cannot be red. If the car were red, it would force the truck to be blue, which contradicts the second statement. Therefore, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes"
