            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down logically. The first statement tells us that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest as well. This can be written as \"If Griffin then Unicorn.\" The second statement tells us that it's not necessarily the case that the unicorn was in the forest. This means that the condition \"Unicorn\" is not a given. Since the presence of the griffin would necessitate the presence of the unicorn, and we know that the presence of the unicorn is not a given, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest. If the griffin were in the forest, then the unicorn would have to be there as well, but since we know that's not necessarily the case, the griffin must not have been there.\n\nAnswer: yes"
