It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that Bob did not necessarily choose pasta. This means that the condition where Sue choosing pizza leads to Bob choosing pasta cannot be true, because we know Bob didn't have to choose pasta. Therefore, Sue could not have chosen pizza, because if she had, it would have forced Bob to choose pasta, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
