It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the pants not being denim is a possibility. Now, let's consider the first statement. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants would have to be denim. However, since we know that the pants not being denim is a possibility, the shirt cannot have been cotton, because that would necessitate the pants being denim, which contradicts our second statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes"
