It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race. (Not necessarily Chris)\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that Chris might not have finished the race. Now, let's use the first statement. If Alex had finished the race, then Chris would have had to finish the race as well. But since we know that's not necessarily the case, it implies that Alex could not have finished the race, because if he had, it would guarantee Chris's completion, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
