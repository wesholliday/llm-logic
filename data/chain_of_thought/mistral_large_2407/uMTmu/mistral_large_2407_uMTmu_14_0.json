            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step.\n\n1. We are given that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den. This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the bear was in the cave\" and Q is \"the wolf must have been in the den.\"\n\n2. We are also given that it's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den. This is the negation of Q.\n\n3. In logic, if we have \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false, we can infer that P must also be false. This is known as modus tollens.\n\nTherefore, if the wolf was not in the den, we can infer that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes"
