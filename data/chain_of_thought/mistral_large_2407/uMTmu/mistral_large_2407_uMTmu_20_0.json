            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down logically. We have two statements:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. (This is a conditional statement, let's call it P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana must have been yellow.\")\n2. It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow. (This is the negation of Q, so we can write it as \u00acQ.)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer that the apple was not red (\u00acP).\n\nAccording to the principle of modus tollens in logic, if P \u2192 Q is true and \u00acQ is true, then we can indeed infer \u00acP. In other words, if the banana wasn't necessarily yellow, then the apple couldn't have been red, assuming our initial conditional statement is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
