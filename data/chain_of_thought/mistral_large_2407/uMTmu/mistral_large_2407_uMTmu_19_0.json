            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\" implies that Jen watching basketball is a necessary consequence of Tom watching football. However, the second statement \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball\" tells us that Jen did not necessarily watch basketball. If Jen did not necessarily watch basketball, then the condition for Tom watching football (which is Jen watching basketball) cannot be met. Therefore, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes"
