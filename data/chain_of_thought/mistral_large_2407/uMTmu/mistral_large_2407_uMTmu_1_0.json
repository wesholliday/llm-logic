            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" implies that Mary's presence at the wedding is a sufficient condition for Sue's presence. However, the second statement \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding\" indicates that Sue's presence was not necessary. If Sue did not have to be at the wedding, then there is no requirement for Mary to be there either, since Mary's presence would necessitate Sue's presence. Therefore, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes"
