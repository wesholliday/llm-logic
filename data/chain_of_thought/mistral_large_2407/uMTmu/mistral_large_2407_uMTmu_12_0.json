            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down logically. The statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" implies that Lucy going to the zoo is a necessary consequence of Joe going to the park. However, the second statement \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" tells us that Lucy did not necessarily go to the zoo. If Lucy did not necessarily go to the zoo, then the condition for Joe going to the park (which is Lucy going to the zoo) is not met. Therefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes"
