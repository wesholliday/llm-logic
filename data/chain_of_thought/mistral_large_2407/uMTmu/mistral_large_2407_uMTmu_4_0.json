It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter. (\u00acQ)\n\nIf the robot did not visit Jupiter (\u00acQ), then according to the first statement (P \u2192 Q), the alien could not have visited Mars (\u00acP). This is because if P were true (the alien visited Mars), then Q would have to be true (the robot visited Jupiter), but we know Q is not true. Therefore, P cannot be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
