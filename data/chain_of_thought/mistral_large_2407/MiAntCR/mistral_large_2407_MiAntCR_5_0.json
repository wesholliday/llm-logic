            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package might be signed for\" indicates a possibility of the package being signed for at some point in time. However, it does not provide any specific time frame for when this might occur. The phrase \"might be delivered today and signed for\" adds a specific time frame (today) that is not implied in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the package might be delivered today and signed for based solely on the statement \"The package might be signed for.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
