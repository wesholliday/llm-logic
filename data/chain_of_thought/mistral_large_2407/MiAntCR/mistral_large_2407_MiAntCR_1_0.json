            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The envelope might be under a bed\" suggests a possibility without specifying the location of the bed. The phrase \"might be\" indicates uncertainty about the envelope's location, but it does not restrict the bed's location. Therefore, it is possible that the bed could be upstairs, downstairs, or anywhere else in the context. Adding \"upstairs\" to the statement simply narrows down the possible locations of the bed, but it does not contradict the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
