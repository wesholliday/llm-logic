It does not give any information about the completion time of the project. The phrase \"might be completed by Friday\" is not implied or suggested by the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The project might be completed by Friday and be under budget\" from \"The project might be under budget\" alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
