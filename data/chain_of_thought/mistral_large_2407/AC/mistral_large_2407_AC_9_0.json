            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\". Here, P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\", and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\". We are given that Q is true (\"Mark bought the blue shirt\"), and we want to determine if P is true (\"Lisa bought the red shirt\"). However, in a conditional statement, knowing that Q is true does not necessarily mean that P is true. This is because P might be a sufficient condition for Q, but it is not necessarily a necessary condition. In other words, there could be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt, not just because Lisa bought the red shirt. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that Lisa bought the red shirt based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no"
