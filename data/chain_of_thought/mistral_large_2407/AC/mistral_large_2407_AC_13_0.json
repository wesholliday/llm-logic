            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement that can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\" We are given that Q is true (\"The truck was blue\"), but we cannot infer from this that P is true. In logic, P \u2192 Q being true and Q being true does not necessarily mean that P is true. For example, the truck could be blue for reasons unrelated to the color of the car. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that \"The car was red\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
