            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is an implication: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This does not mean that the truck being metal automatically implies that the doll was plastic. In logical terms, the statement is a conditional (if P, then Q), which does not imply the converse (if Q, then P). Therefore, knowing that the truck was metal does not necessarily mean that the doll was plastic; the doll could be made of any material.\n\nAnswer: no"
