            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement that tells us Sue's presence is a necessary condition for Mary's presence. It means that if Mary was there, then Sue must have been there as well. However, it does not imply that Sue's presence means Mary was there. In other words, Sue being at the wedding does not guarantee that Mary was also there. Therefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no"
