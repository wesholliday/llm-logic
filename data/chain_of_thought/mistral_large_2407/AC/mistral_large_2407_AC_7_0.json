The second statement asserts that Q is true, i.e., \"Chris finished the race\". However, in logic, just because the consequent (Q) is true does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (P) is true. In other words, just because Chris finished the race does not mean that Alex must have finished the race. The conditional statement only tells us that if Alex did finish, then Chris did as well, but it does not provide any information about whether Alex actually finished the race or not.\n\nAnswer: no"
