The conditional statement is \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\" The additional statement is \"The robot visited Jupiter.\" In logic, if the conditional statement is true and the consequent (the \"then\" part) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is true. This is because the truth of the consequent does not imply the truth of the antecedent; the antecedent could be false and the consequent could still be true due to some other reason. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that \"The alien visited Mars\" based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
