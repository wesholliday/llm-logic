            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\". Here, P is \"the shirt was cotton\", and Q is \"the pants were denim\". The second statement is \"The pants were denim\", which is Q. We are asked if we can infer P from Q. In logic, the truth of the consequent (Q) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (P). In other words, just because the pants were denim does not mean that the shirt must have been cotton; the shirt could be made of another material. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The shirt was cotton' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
