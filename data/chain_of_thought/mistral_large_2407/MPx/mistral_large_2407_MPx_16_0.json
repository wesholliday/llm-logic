            "content": "Explanation: The given information presents us with a conditional statement: \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\" This can be logically represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the sneg was crampled\" and Q is \"the sneg sproted the frink.\" The second statement asserts that P is true: \"The sneg was crampled.\" In logic, if P is true and P \u2192 Q is true, then Q must also be true. This is known as modus ponens, a fundamental rule of inference in logic. Therefore, if the sneg was indeed crampled, then it follows that the sneg sproted the frink.\n\nAnswer: yes"
