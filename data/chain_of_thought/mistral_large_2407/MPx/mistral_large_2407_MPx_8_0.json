            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a conditional (if P, then Q) and a premise (P). According to modus ponens, a valid form of argument in logic, if the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is true and the antecedent P is true, then the consequent Q must also be true. In this case, \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" is the conditional statement, and \"The sprocket was cranked\" is the premise. Since both are given as true, we can indeed infer that \"The sprocket was daggled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
