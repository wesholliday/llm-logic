The conditional statement is \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\" The fact is \"The splat was morphed.\" According to modus ponens, a logical rule of inference, if the condition (the splat was morphed) is true, then the consequence (the splat quanked) must also be true. Therefore, based on the given information, we can logically infer that the splat quanked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
