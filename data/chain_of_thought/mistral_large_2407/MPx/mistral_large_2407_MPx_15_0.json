The conditional statement is \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\" The fact is \"The dreb was vroombed.\" According to modus ponens, a logical rule of inference, if the condition (the dreb was vroombed) is true, then the consequence (the dreb was spened) must also be true. Therefore, given that the dreb was indeed vroombed, we can logically infer that the dreb was spened.\n\nAnswer: yes"
