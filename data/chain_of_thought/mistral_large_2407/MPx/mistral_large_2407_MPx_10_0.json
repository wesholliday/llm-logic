The conditional statement establishes a relationship between two events: if the first event (\"the wug was sproinged\") occurs, then the second event (\"it was garpled\") must also occur. Since the factual statement confirms that the first event did indeed occur, we can logically infer that the second event also occurred based on the relationship established by the conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
