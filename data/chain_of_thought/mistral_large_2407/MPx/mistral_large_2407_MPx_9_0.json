The first statement, \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished,\" establishes a condition that if the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished. The second statement, \"The twonk was plinked,\" confirms that the condition has been met. Therefore, according to the first statement, since the twonk was plinked, it follows that it was varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes"
