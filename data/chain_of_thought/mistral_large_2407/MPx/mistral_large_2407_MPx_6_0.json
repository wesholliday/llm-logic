The conditional statement is \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\" The fact given is \"The grommet was sploffed.\" According to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if the condition (\"the grommet was sploffed\") is true, then the consequence (\"the grommet plopped the frink\") must also be true. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can indeed infer that \"The grommet plopped the frink.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
