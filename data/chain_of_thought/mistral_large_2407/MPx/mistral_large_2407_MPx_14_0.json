The conditional statement is \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\" The fact is \"The clug was fleeked.\" According to modus ponens, a logical rule of inference, if the condition (the clug was fleeked) is true, then the consequence (the clug snugged) must also be true. Therefore, given that the clug was indeed fleeked, we can logically infer that the clug snugged.\n\nAnswer: yes"
