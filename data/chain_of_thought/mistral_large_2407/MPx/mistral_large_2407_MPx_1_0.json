The conditional statement is \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\" The fact is \"The flugel was blimmed.\" According to modus ponens, a logical rule of inference, if the condition (the flugel was blimmed) is true, then the consequence (the flugel was zargled) must also be true. Therefore, based on the given information, we can logically infer that the flugel was zargled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
