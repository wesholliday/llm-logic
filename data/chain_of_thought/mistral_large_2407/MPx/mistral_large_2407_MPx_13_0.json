The conditional statement is \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\" The fact given is \"The glip was slogged.\" According to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if the condition (\"the glip was slogged\") is true, then the consequence (\"the glip was tragged\") must also be true. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can indeed infer that \"The glip was tragged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
