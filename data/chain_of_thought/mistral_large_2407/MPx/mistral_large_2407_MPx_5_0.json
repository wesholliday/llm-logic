            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a conditional (if-then) statement and a fact. The first statement is \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled,\" which can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the zinger was fraggled\" and Q is \"the zinger was smoogled.\" The second statement is \"The zinger was fraggled,\" which is asserting that P is true. According to modus ponens, a valid form of argument in propositional logic, if P \u2192 Q is true and P is true, then Q must also be true. Therefore, if \"the zinger was fraggled\" is true, then \"the zinger was smoogled\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
