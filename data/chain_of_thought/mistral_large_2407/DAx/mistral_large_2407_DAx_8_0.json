            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" and \"The sprocket was not cranked.\" The first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and Q is \"the sprocket was daggled.\" The second statement tells us that P is false (\"The sprocket was not cranked\"). In logic, if the condition (P) of a conditional statement is false, then the conclusion (Q) does not necessarily follow. However, we cannot infer that Q is false just because P is false. The statement doesn't provide any information about what happens to the sprocket when it is not cranked. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The sprocket was not daggled\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
