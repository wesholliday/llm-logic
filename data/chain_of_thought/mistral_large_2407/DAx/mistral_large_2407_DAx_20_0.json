            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a conditional and a negation. The first statement, \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned,\" can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the fleeg was bluttered\" and Q is \"it surned.\" The second statement is \"The fleeg was not bluttered,\" which is \u00acP.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The fleeg did not surn\" (\u00acQ), we can use the logical principle of modus tollens, which states that if P \u2192 Q and \u00acP are true, then \u00acQ must also be true. In other words, if the condition (P) is not met, then the result (Q) does not happen.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and using modus tollens, we can infer that \"The fleeg did not surn.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
