            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a conditional and a negation. The first statement, \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged,\" can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the glip was slogged\" and Q is \"the glip was tragged.\" The second statement is \"The glip was not slogged,\" which is \u00acP.\n\nAccording to the principle of modus tollens in logic, if P \u2192 Q is true and \u00acP is true, then \u00acQ must also be true. In other words, if the glip was not slogged, then it cannot be true that the glip was tragged (since being tragged is a consequence of being slogged).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can indeed infer that the glip was not tragged.\n\nAnswer: yes"
