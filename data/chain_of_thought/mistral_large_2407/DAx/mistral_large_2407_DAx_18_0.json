            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a conditional statement and a negation. The first statement, \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged,\" can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the shank was plooked\" and Q is \"the shank was nugged.\" The second statement is \"The shank was not plooked,\" which can be written as \u00acP.\n\nAccording to the rules of inference in logic, specifically modus tollens, if we have P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then we can infer \u00acP. However, in this case, we have \u00acP, not \u00acQ. But since P is false (\u00acP is true), we cannot conclude anything about Q from the given statements alone. The shank might or might not have been nugged; the information is not sufficient to determine the truth value of Q.\n\nAnswer: no"
