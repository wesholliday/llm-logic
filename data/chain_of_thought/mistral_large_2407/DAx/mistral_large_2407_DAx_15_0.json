            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a conditional statement and a negation. The first statement, \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened,\" can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and Q is \"the dreb was spened.\" The second statement is \"The dreb was not vroombed,\" which is the negation of P (~P).\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement P \u2192 Q and we know that ~P is true, we can't directly infer anything about Q. This is because the truth of P \u2192 Q only tells us what happens when P is true, not when P is false. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The dreb was not spened\" (~Q) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
