According to the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens, if the antecedent (P) is false, then the consequent (Q) does not necessarily have to be false. In other words, \"If P, then Q\" and \"not P\" do not lead to \"not Q\". We cannot infer the truth value of Q from these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
