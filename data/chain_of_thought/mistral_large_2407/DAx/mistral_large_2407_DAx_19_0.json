            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a conditional and a negation. The first statement, \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged,\" can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the smonk was vreebled\" and Q is \"the smonk plagged.\" The second statement is \"The smonk was not vreebled,\" which is \u00acP.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The smonk was not plagged\" (\u00acQ), we can use the logical principle of modus tollens, which states that if P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ are true, then \u00acP must be true. However, in this case, we have \u00acP as a given, not \u00acQ.\n\nInstead, we can use the principle of the contrapositive, which states that P \u2192 Q is logically equivalent to \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP. Since we know \u00acP is true, we can infer that \u00acQ is also true, meaning \"The smonk was not plagged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
