            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a conditional and a negation. The first statement, \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink,\" can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the grommet was sploffed\" and Q is \"the grommet plopped the frink.\" The second statement is \"The grommet was not sploffed,\" which is \u00acP.\n\nIn logic, if we have P \u2192 Q and we know that \u00acP is true, it doesn't directly tell us anything about Q. However, we can use the contrapositive of the first statement, which is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP. Since we know \u00acP is true, the contrapositive implies that \u00acQ must also be true to maintain the truth of the original statement. Therefore, \"The grommet did not plop the frink\" (\u00acQ) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
