            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" and \"The splat was not morphed.\" The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the splat was morphed) is true, then the consequence (the splat quanked) is also true. However, the second statement tells us that the condition is not true (the splat was not morphed). Since the condition is not true, the conditional statement does not give us any information about whether the splat quanked or not. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The splat did not quank\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
