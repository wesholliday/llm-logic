            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a conditional (if-then) statement and a negation. The first statement is \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink,\" which can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the sneg was crampled\" and Q is \"the sneg sproted the frink.\" The second statement is \"The sneg was not crampled,\" which is the negation of P (~P).\n\nIn logic, if the condition (P) is false (~P), then the implication (P \u2192 Q) does not necessarily tell us anything about Q. However, since the second statement asserts that P is false, we can infer that the condition for Q to happen did not occur. Therefore, we can conclude that Q did not happen, which means \"The sneg did not sprot the frink.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
