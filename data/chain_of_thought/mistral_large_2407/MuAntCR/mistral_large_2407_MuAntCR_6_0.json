It does not give any information about the ticket sales or attendance. Therefore, we cannot infer that the concert must have been sold out based solely on the given statement. The two parts of the inferred statement (\"the concert must have been sold out\" and \"started at 8 PM\") are not both supported by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
