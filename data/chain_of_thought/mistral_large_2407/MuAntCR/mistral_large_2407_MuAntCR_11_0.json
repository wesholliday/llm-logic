It doesn't provide any information about whether the software was also updated. The phrase \"must have been\" indicates a certainty about the restart, but it doesn't extend that certainty to an update. Therefore, we cannot infer that the software was both updated and restarted based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
