            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The milk might not be on the counter\" suggests that there is a possibility the milk is not on the counter. It does not definitively state where the milk is, just that it might not be on the counter. If the milk must be on the counter, then the statement \"The milk might not be on the counter\" would be false, because \"must\" implies certainty, while \"might not\" implies uncertainty or possibility. Therefore, if the milk might not be on the counter, it's not certain that the milk is there, which means it's not the case that the milk must be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes"
