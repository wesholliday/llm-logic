It does not definitively rule out the possibility that Jeff played basketball, but it introduces doubt. Therefore, if Jeff might not have played basketball, we cannot definitively say that he must have played basketball. The phrase \"might not have\" suggests a lack of certainty, which contradicts the idea that something \"must have\" happened.\n\nAnswer: yes"
