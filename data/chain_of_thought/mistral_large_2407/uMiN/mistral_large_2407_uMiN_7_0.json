It suggests that there are two possibilities: either Alex finished the race or Alex did not finish the race. This uncertainty means that we cannot definitively say that Alex must have finished the race. Therefore, we can indeed infer that it's not the case that Alex must have finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes"
