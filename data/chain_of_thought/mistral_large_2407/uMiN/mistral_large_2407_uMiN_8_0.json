This possibility introduces uncertainty about the vampire's state of wakefulness. If it's possible that the vampire was not awake, then we cannot definitively say that the vampire must have been awake. The use of \"might not\" indicates that there is room for doubt, which contradicts the certainty implied by \"must have been.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
