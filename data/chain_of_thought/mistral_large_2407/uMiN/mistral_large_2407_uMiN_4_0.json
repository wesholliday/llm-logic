It does not definitively rule out the possibility that the alien did visit Mars; it simply introduces uncertainty. The phrase \"it's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars\" means that it is not certain or necessary that the alien visited Mars. Given the uncertainty introduced by \"might not,\" we can indeed infer that it's not certain that the alien visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes"
