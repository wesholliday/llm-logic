            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The toy might not be in the toy box\" implies that there is a possibility that the toy is not in the toy box. It does not definitively state that the toy is not in the toy box, but rather that it is not guaranteed to be there. Therefore, if the toy might not be in the toy box, it cannot be true that the toy must be in the toy box, as the word \"must\" indicates a certainty that the statement does not support.\n\nAnswer: yes"
