            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The book might not have been written by James\" suggests that there is some uncertainty or possibility that someone other than James wrote the book. It does not definitively rule out James as the author; it simply introduces doubt. The phrase \"it's not the case that the book must have been written by James\" means that it is not necessarily true that James wrote the book, which aligns with the initial statement's implication of uncertainty. Therefore, we can indeed infer that it's not the case that the book must have been written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes"
