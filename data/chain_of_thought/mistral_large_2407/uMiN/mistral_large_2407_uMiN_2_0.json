            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The griffin might not have been in the forest\" suggests that there is a possibility that the griffin was not in the forest. It does not definitively state that the griffin was not there, but rather that it is not certain that the griffin was there. If it's not certain that the griffin was in the forest, then we cannot say that the griffin must have been in the forest. Therefore, we can infer that it's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes"
