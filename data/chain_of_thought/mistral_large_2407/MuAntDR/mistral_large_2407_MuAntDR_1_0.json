The use of the word \"or\" indicates that either one of the conditions could be true. It does not necessarily mean that both conditions must be true at the same time. Therefore, from the given statement, we cannot definitively conclude that the envelope must have been upstairs, as it could also have been under a bed.\n\nAnswer: no"
