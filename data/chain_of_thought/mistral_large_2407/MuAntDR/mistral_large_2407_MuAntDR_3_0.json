            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The keys must have been in the drawer or on the table\" presents two possible locations for the keys. The use of \"or\" in this context implies that either one or the other could be true, or possibly both. However, it does not necessarily mean that the keys must have been on the table specifically. The keys could have been in the drawer, on the table, or in either place. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The keys must have been on the table\" from the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
