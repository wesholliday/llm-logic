            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document must have been signed or notarized\" presents two possible conditions for the document: it could have been signed, or it could have been notarized. The use of the word \"or\" indicates that either condition is sufficient, but it does not necessarily mean that both conditions must be true. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The document must have been notarized\" from the given statement, as it is possible that the document was only signed.\n\nAnswer: no"
