The use of the word \"or\" indicates that either one of these actions could have occurred, but it does not necessarily mean that both did. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The software must have been reinstalled\" from the given statement, as it is possible that the software was only updated.\n\nAnswer: no"
