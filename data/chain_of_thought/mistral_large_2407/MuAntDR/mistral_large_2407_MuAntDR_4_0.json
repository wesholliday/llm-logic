However, without additional information, we cannot definitively conclude that the meeting was cancelled. The statement does not provide enough evidence to rule out the possibility that the meeting occurred at 2 PM. Therefore, we cannot infer that the meeting must have been cancelled based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
