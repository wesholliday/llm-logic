            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The restaurant must have been closed on Monday or open for limited hours\" presents two possibilities. It does not provide a definitive condition that allows us to infer one possibility over the other. The use of \"or\" in this context means that either one of the conditions could be true, or both could be true. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the restaurant must have been open for limited hours based on the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
