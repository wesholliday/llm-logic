The use of \"or\" in this context is inclusive, meaning the book could be in either place or both. However, it does not necessarily mean that the book must have been in the library; it could have been on the shelf instead. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The book must have been in the library\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
