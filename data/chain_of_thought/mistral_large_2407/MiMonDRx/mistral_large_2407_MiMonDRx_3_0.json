It does not exclude other possibilities, such as the wozzle being in the quazzle. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that \"The wozzle might be in the quazzle or in the grooble\" because this statement includes the original possibility (the grooble) and adds another possibility (the quazzle).\n\nAnswer: yes"
