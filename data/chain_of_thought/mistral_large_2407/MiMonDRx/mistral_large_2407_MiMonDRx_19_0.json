When we consider the statement \"The flonk might be frazzle or be grazzle,\" this includes the possibility that the flonk is grazzle, as well as the additional possibility that the flonk is frazzle. Since the original statement does not exclude the flonk being frazzle, it is logically valid to infer that \"The flonk might be frazzle or be grazzle\" from \"The flonk might be grazzle.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
