The question asks if we can infer that \"The zibber might wibble a frazzle or be flim a grazzle.\" This new statement includes the original possibility (\"be flim a grazzle\") and adds another possibility (\"wibble a frazzle\"). Since the original statement does not exclude other possibilities, it is valid to infer that the zibber might do something else in addition to what was originally stated.\n\nAnswer: yes"
