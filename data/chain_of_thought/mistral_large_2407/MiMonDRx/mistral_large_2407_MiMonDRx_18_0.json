            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The snizzle might be zazzle\" suggests that there is a possibility that the snizzle is zazzle. When we consider the statement \"The snizzle might be glorp or zazzle,\" this includes the original possibility (that the snizzle is zazzle) and adds an additional possibility (that the snizzle is glorp). Since the original statement does not exclude the snizzle being glorp, the inference is valid. In other words, if the snizzle might be zazzle, it can certainly be one of multiple possibilities, including glorp or zazzle.\n\nAnswer: yes"
