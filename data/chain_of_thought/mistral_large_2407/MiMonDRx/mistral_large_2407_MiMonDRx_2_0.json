            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The zibber might be on the wump\" suggests that there is a possibility the zibber is located on the wump. When we consider the statement \"The zibber might be on the floob or on the wump,\" this statement includes the possibility that the zibber is on the wump, among other possibilities (such as being on the floob). Since the original statement does not exclude the zibber from being on the floob, and it explicitly includes the possibility of the zibber being on the wump, the inference is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
