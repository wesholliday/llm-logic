When we consider the statement \"The gronk might be zazzle or flimble,\" this includes the possibility that the gronk is flimble, as well as the additional possibility that the gronk is zazzle. Since the original statement does not exclude the gronk being zazzle, the inference is valid because it merely adds another possibility without contradicting the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
