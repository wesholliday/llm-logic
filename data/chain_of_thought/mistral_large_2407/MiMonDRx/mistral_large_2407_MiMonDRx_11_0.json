When we consider the statement \"The frazzle might be quork or snork,\" this includes \"snork\" as one of the possibilities. Since \"snork\" is already a possibility in the original statement, it is logically included in the second statement that presents \"snork\" as one of multiple possibilities. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
