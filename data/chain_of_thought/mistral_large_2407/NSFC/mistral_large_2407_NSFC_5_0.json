            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"Sarah might study biology or chemistry\" indicates that there are two possibilities: Sarah might study biology, or she might study chemistry. It does not exclude the possibility that she could study either one. Therefore, we can break down the statement into two separate possibilities: \"Sarah might study biology\" and \"Sarah might study chemistry.\" This is because the use of \"or\" in the original statement implies that at least one of the two options is possible, but it does not restrict it to only one of them.\n\nAnswer: yes"
