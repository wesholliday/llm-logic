            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package might arrive on Monday or Tuesday\" means that there are two possible days for the package to arrive, and it could be either one of them. When we break this down, it implies that each day is a possibility on its own. Therefore, we can say \"The package might arrive on Monday\" and also \"The package might arrive on Tuesday\" because both are valid possibilities according to the original statement. The use of \"or\" in the original statement does not exclude the possibility of considering each option separately.\n\nAnswer: yes"
