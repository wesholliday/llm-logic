It means that the candidate could potentially win the election, and the candidate could also potentially lose the election. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that \"The candidate might win the election and the candidate might lose the election\" because both scenarios are acknowledged as possibilities in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
