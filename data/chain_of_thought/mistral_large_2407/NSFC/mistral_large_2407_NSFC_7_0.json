            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The team might win or lose the match\" implies that there are two possible outcomes: winning or losing. The phrase \"might win or lose\" indicates that both outcomes are possible. When we break this down into two separate statements, \"The team might win the match\" and \"The team might lose the match,\" we are simply expressing the same possibilities individually. Therefore, the inference is valid because it accurately reflects the two potential outcomes described in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
