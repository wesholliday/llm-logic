When we say \"might,\" we indicate that both outcomes are possible. Therefore, it is reasonable to break down this statement into two separate possibilities: \"The student might pass the exam\" and \"The student might fail the exam.\" This breakdown maintains the original meaning of the statement, which is that both outcomes are possible.\n\nAnswer: yes"
