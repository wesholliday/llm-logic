            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The toy might not be in the toy box\" implies that there is a possibility that the toy is not in the toy box. It does not assert with certainty where the toy is, only that it is not guaranteed to be in the toy box. The phrase \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\" means that it is not necessarily true that the toy is in the toy box, which aligns with the original statement's implication of uncertainty. Therefore, the inference is logically consistent with the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
