            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The notebook might not be in the drawer' implies that there is a possibility that the notebook is not in the drawer. It does not confirm the notebook's absence; it merely suggests that its presence is not guaranteed. On the other hand, 'It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer' means that the notebook's presence is not a certainty, which aligns with the first statement. If something 'might not be,' then it's indeed not a necessity or certainty that it is.\n\nAnswer: yes"
