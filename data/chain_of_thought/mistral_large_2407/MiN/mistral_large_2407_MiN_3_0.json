This statement does not assert with certainty that James did not write the book; it merely introduces doubt. On the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James\" means that it is not necessarily true that James wrote the book, which aligns with the idea that there is some doubt or uncertainty about James being the author. Therefore, the first statement can indeed be inferred from the second.\n\nAnswer: yes"
