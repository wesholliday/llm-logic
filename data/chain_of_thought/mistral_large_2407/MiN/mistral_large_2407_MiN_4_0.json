            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The alien might not have visited Mars\" implies that there is a possibility that the alien did not visit Mars. It does not assert with certainty that the alien did or did not visit Mars; it merely suggests that it is not a necessity that the alien visited Mars. Therefore, if we negate the statement \"The alien must have visited Mars,\" we get \"It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars,\" which aligns with the original statement's implication of uncertainty.\n\nAnswer: yes"
