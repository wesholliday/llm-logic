This means that her presence at the wedding is not certain. If her presence was certain, then the statement would be \"Mary must have been at the wedding.\" Therefore, the phrase \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" indeed suggests that it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes"
