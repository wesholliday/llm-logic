            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The milk might not be on the counter\" implies that there is a possibility the milk is not on the counter. It does not assert with certainty where the milk is, only that it is not guaranteed to be on the counter. The phrase \"It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter\" means that it is not necessarily true that the milk is on the counter, which aligns with the original statement's implication of uncertainty. Therefore, the inference is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
