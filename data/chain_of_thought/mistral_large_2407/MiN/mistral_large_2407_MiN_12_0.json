            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The jacket might not be draped over the chair' implies that there is a possibility that the jacket is not on the chair. This means it's not a certainty that the jacket is on the chair. Therefore, it logically follows that 'It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair' because 'must' implies certainty, which is contradicted by the original statement's suggestion of uncertainty.\n\nAnswer: yes"
