The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\n\nThe first statement presents two possibilities: the jacket is either on the chair or in the closet. The second statement introduces uncertainty about the jacket being in the closet. However, since the jacket has to be in one of the two places (according to the first statement), and it might not be in the closet (according to the second statement), the only remaining possibility is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes"
