The book might not be resting on the table.\n\nThe first statement presents two possibilities: the book is on the shelf or the book is on the table. The second statement introduces doubt about the book being on the table. However, it does not confirm that the book is not on the table; it only suggests that it might not be. Since the book could still be on the table, we cannot definitively conclude that the book is on the shelf based solely on these statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
