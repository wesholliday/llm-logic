However, the additional statement \"the milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" introduces uncertainty about the second location but does not confirm the first. Logically, if the milk is not definitely in the fridge, it could still be somewhere else besides the counter. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the milk is on the counter based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
