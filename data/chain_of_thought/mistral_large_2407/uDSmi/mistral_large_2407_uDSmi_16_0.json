However, the additional statement \"the pen might not be on my desk\" introduces uncertainty about the pen's location on the desk. Since the pen might not be on the desk, the only remaining option from the first statement is that the pen is in the bag. Therefore, we can infer that the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
