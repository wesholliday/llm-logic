However, it also states that the notebook might not be on the nightstand. This second part does not confirm that the notebook is indeed not on the nightstand; it merely introduces doubt about that location. Since there's uncertainty about the nightstand, we cannot definitively conclude that the notebook must be in the drawer. We can only infer that it might be.\n\nAnswer: no"
