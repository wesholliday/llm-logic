However, the additional statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" introduces uncertainty about Fido's location in the garden. Since the first statement allows for the possibility that Fido is inside, and the second statement does not exclude the possibility that Fido is inside, we cannot definitively conclude that Fido is inside. The uncertainty about Fido's presence in the garden does not provide enough information to infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: no"
