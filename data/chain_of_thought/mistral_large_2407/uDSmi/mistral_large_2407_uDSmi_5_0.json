However, it also states that the cookies might not be hidden in the pantry. This means that the only remaining option from the initial statement is that the cookies are in the jar. If the cookies were not in the jar, then they would have to be in the pantry, but since they might not be in the pantry, the only logical conclusion is that the cookies are indeed in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes"
