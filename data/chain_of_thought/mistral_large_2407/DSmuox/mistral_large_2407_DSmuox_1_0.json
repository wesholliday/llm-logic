The first statement is \"It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled.\" This can be rewritten as \"The flugel does not have to be zargled.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled.\" This means that if the flugel is not blimmed, then it must be zargled.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- Since the flugel does not have to be zargled (from the first statement), the only possibility left in the second statement is that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that \"The flugel is blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
