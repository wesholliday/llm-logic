The first statement is \"It's not the case that the flob must be movated.\" This can be rephrased as \"The flob does not have to be movated.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated.\" This gives us two possibilities: either the flob is skizzled, or it must be movated.\n\n3. Since we know from the first statement that the flob does not have to be movated, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the flob is skizzled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
