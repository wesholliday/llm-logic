The first statement is \"It's not the case that the wug must be garpled.\" This can be rephrased as \"The wug does not have to be garpled.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled.\" This gives us two possibilities: either the wug is sproinged, or it must be garpled.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. Since we know from the first statement that the wug does not have to be garpled, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the wug is sproinged.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The wug is sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
