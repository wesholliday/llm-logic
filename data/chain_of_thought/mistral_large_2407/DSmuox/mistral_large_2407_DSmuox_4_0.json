The first statement is \"It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked.\" This can be rephrased as \"The fribble does not have to be crinked.\"\n2. The second statement is \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked.\" This gives us two possibilities: either the fribble is snurgled, or it must be crinked.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. Since the first statement tells us that the fribble does not have to be crinked, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
