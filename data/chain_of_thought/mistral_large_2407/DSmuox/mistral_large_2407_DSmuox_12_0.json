The first statement is \"It's not the case that the smip must be lupped.\" This can be rewritten as \"The smip does not have to be lupped.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the smip is shripped or it must be lupped.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- Since the first statement tells us that \"The smip does not have to be lupped,\" the only way for the second statement to be true is if \"The smip is shripped.\"\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"The smip is shripped.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
