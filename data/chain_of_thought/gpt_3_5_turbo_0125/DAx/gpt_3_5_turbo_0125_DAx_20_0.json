However, we are given that the fleeg was not bluttered (Not A). \n\nSince we do not have any information about what happens when the fleeg is not bluttered, we cannot directly infer that the fleeg did not surn. The absence of being bluttered does not necessarily mean the absence of surning.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The fleeg did not surn\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
