The contrapositive of the statement \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A.\" \n\nGiven:\n1. If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint. (If A then B)\n2. The wug was not flooped. (Not A)\n\nFrom the contrapositive, we have:\n- If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped. (If not B then not A)\n\nTherefore, based on the contrapositive, we can infer that if the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped. This means that we cannot directly infer 'The wug did not bim the zoint' from the given statements.",
