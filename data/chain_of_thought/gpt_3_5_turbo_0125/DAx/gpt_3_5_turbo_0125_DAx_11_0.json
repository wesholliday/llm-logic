The contrapositive of \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A.\" \n\nGiven:\n1. If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\n2. The flug was not blummed.\n\nContrapositive of the first statement:\n- If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed.\n\nNow, combining the contrapositive with the second statement:\n- The flug was not blummed.\n- Therefore, we can infer that the flug was not zimmed.\n\nThis inference is valid based on the contrapositive relationship between the statements. \n\nAnswer: yes",
