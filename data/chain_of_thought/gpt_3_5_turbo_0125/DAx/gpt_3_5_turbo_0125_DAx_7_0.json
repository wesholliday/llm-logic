It states that if the whiffle was shanked, then it tinked.\n\n2. \"The whiffle was not shanked\" - This statement tells us that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer the following:\n\n- Since the whiffle was not shanked, we cannot determine whether it tinked or not based on the first conditional statement.\n- The first conditional statement only tells us what happens if the whiffle was shanked, but it does not provide information about what happens if the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the whiffle did not tink based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
