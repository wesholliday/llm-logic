However, the second statement tells us that the grommet was not sploffed. \n\nSince the condition for the grommet to plop the frink (being sploffed) did not occur, we cannot definitively conclude whether the grommet plopped the frink or not based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The grommet did not plop the frink\" from the provided statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
