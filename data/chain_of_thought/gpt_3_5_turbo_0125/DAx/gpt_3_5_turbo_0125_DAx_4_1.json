However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the fribble was not snurgled.\n\n2. \"The fribble was not snurgled\" - This statement tells us that the fribble was not snurgled. Since the first statement only gives us information about what happens if the fribble was snurgled, the fact that the fribble was not snurgled does not directly contradict it.\n\n3. From the information provided, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The fribble did not crinkle\" because the first statement leaves open the possibility that the fribble crinked in a different scenario (when it was snurgled). The absence of information about what happens when the fribble is not snurgled limits our ability to make a definitive inference about whether it crinkled or not.\n\nIn summary, based on the given statements, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The fribble did not crinkle.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
