However, the second statement tells us that the splat was not morphed (\u00acA). \n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot directly infer that \"The splat did not quank\" because the first statement only establishes a conditional relationship between morphing and quanking. Since we know the splat was not morphed, we do not have enough information to determine whether it quanked or not. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The splat did not quank' from the given statements.",
