If we deny the consequent in the original conditional statement, we can conclude the denial of the antecedent. So, if we deny B (whiffle did not tink), we can infer the negation of A (whiffle was shanked). \n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and applying modus tollens, we can infer that \"The whiffle did not tink.\" \n\nAnswer: yes",

The given conditional statement is: If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.

The statement \"The whiffle was not shanked\" can be represented as: \\( \\neg \\text{Shanked} \\), where \\( \\neg \\) denotes \"not\".\n\n3. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent. The contrapositive of the given conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). Therefore, in this case, the contrapositive of \\( \\text{Shanked} \\rightarrow \\text{Tinked} \\) is \\( \\neg \\text{Tinked} \\rightarrow \\neg \\text{Shanked} \\), which can be read as \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked.\"\n\n4.
