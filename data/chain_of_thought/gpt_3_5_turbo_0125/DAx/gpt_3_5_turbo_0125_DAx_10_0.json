However, we are given that the wug was not sproinged. \n\nSince we do not have any information about what happens when the wug is not sproinged, we cannot definitively infer whether the wug was or was not garpled based on the given information. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the wug was not garpled. \n\nAnswer: no",
