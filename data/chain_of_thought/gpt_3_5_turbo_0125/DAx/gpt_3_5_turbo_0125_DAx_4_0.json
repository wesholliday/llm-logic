The first statement is: \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"The fribble was not snurgled.\"\n\nGiven these statements, we can analyze the logic:\n\n- If the fribble was snurgled, then it crinked. This means that crinking is a consequence of being snurgled.\n- The second statement tells us that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot directly infer that the fribble did not crink. This is because the first statement only tells us what happens if the fribble was snurgled, but it does not provide information about what happens if the fribble was not snurgled. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the fribble did not crink.\n\nAnswer: no",
