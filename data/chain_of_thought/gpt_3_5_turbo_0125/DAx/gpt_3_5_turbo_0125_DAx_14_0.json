It states that if the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\n\n2. \"The clug was not fleeked\" - This statement tells us that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nFrom these two premises, we can infer that since the clug was not fleeked, we cannot conclude anything about whether the clug was snugged or not. The first premise only tells us what happens if the clug was fleeked, but it does not provide information about what happens if the clug was not fleeked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The clug was not snugged\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
