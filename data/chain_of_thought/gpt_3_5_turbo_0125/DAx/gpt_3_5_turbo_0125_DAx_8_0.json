(Not A)\n\nFrom the contrapositive of the first statement:\n- If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked. (If not B then not A)\n\nSince we know that the sprocket was not cranked (Not A), we can conclude that the sprocket was not daggled based on the contrapositive of the first statement.\n\nTherefore, the inference \"The sprocket was not daggled\" can be made from the given statements.",
