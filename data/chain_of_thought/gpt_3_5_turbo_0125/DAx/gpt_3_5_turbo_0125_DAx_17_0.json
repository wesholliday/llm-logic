The contrapositive of \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A.\" \n\nGiven:\n1. If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated. (A -> B)\n2. The flob was not skizzled. (not A)\n\nContrapositive of statement 1:\n3. If the flob was not movated, then the flob was not skizzled. (not B -> not A)\n\nNow, combining statement 2 and the contrapositive of statement 1:\n- The flob was not skizzled (not A)\n- If the flob was not movated, then the flob was not skizzled (not B -> not A)\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The flob was not movated\" from the given statements. \n\nAnswer: yes",
