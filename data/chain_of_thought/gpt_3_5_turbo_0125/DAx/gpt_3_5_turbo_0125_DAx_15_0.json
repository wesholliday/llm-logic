The contrapositive of \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A.\"\n\nGiven:\n1. If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened. (If A then B)\n2. The dreb was not vroombed. (Not A)\n\nFrom the contrapositive of the first statement:\n- If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed. (If not B then not A)\n\nNow, combining the second premise with the contrapositive:\n- The dreb was not vroombed. (Not A)\n- Therefore, we can infer that the dreb was not spened. (Not B)\n\nSo, based on the given premises and the contrapositive reasoning, we can infer that \"The dreb was not spened.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
