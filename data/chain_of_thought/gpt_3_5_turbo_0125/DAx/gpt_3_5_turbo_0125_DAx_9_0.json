The contrapositive of \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A.\"\n\nGiven:\n1. If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished. (A -> B)\n2. The twonk was not plinked. (not A)\n\nContrapositive of statement 1:\n3. If the twonk was not varnished, then it was not plinked. (not B -> not A)\n\nFrom statements 2 and 3, we can infer that if the twonk was not plinked, then it was not varnished. Therefore, we can infer \"The twonk was not varnished.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
