When we add the new statement \"The wumble might floob the crunk or zibber the flimble,\" it introduces a new action of floobing the crunk. However, the original statement still holds true as a possibility within the new statement. Therefore, we can infer that the wumble might zibber the flimble based on the new statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
