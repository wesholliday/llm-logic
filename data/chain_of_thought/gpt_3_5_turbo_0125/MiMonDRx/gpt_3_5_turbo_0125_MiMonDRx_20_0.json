When we add the new statement \"The zooble might grazzle the flim or grooble the flonk,\" we see that it includes the original possibility of the zooble groobling the flonk. Additionally, it introduces a new possibility of the zooble grazzling the flim. Therefore, based on the new statement, we can infer that the zooble might grooble the flonk or might grazzle the flim.\n\nAnswer: yes",
