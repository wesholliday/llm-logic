The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This means that whenever the cake is chocolate, the muffins are blueberry.\n2. The second statement directly states that \"The muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nGiven these statements:\n- We cannot directly infer that the cake was chocolate just because the muffins were blueberry. The given information only tells us that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry, but it does not tell us anything about the cake if the muffins were blueberry.\n\nBy looking at the statements individually and considering the logical implications, we can see that we cannot logically infer \"The cake was chocolate\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
