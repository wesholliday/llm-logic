Since we are given that Mark bought the blue shirt, it satisfies the condition in the first statement. However, we cannot definitively conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt because the first statement only establishes a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. It does not provide any information about what happens if Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically infer that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
