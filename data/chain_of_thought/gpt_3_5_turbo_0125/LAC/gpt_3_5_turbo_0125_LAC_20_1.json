The original statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P represents the apple being red and Q represents the banana being yellow. When the second statement tells us that the banana was indeed yellow, it satisfies the consequent Q of the conditional statement. However, it does not tell us whether the antecedent P is true or false. \n\nJust because the banana was yellow does not necessarily mean that the apple was red, as there could be other reasons for the banana being yellow (e.g., the banana being painted yellow).
