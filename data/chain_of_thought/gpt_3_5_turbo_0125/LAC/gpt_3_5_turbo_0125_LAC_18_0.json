However, this does not tell us anything about the doll if the truck was metal. It only establishes a relationship between the doll being plastic and the truck being metal.\n\nGiven that the second statement tells us that the truck was metal, we can conclude that the first statement does not provide enough information to infer that the doll was plastic. The doll could be plastic or not, as the first statement only establishes a condition for the relationship between the doll and the truck.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically infer that the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: no",
