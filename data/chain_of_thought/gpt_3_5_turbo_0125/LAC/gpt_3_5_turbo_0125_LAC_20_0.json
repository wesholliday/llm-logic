However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the apple is not red.\n\n2. \"The banana was yellow\": This statement directly tells us that the banana was yellow.\n\nGiven these statements, we cannot definitively infer that the apple was red. The first statement only tells us about the relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana, but it does not provide information about the color of the apple when the banana is yellow. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that the apple was red based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
