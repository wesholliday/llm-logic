We also know that Chris finished the race. However, we cannot definitively conclude that Alex finished the race based on the information provided. This is because the first statement only establishes a one-way implication from Alex to Chris, but it does not provide information about whether Chris finishing the race implies Alex finishing the race.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot logically infer that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
