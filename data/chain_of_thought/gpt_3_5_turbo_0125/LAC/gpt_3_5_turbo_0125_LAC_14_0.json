If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. (If A then B)\n2. The wolf was in the den. (B)\n\nFrom statement 1, we can derive the contrapositive:\n3. If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave. (If not B then not A)\n\nSince we know that the wolf was in the den (statement 2), we can conclude that the contrapositive does not apply in this case. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that the bear was in the cave based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
