However, we cannot directly infer that the alien visited Mars (A) based on the given information alone. The statement \"If A then R\" does not provide enough information to conclude that A is true just because R is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot logically infer that the alien visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: no",
