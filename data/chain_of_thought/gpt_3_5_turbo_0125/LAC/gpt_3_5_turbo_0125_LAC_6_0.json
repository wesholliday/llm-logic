The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This statement does not provide any information about what happens if Bob chose pasta. It only tells us what happens if Sue chose pizza.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"Bob chose pasta.\" This statement does not provide any information about what Sue chose.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot logically infer that Sue chose pizza. The first statement only tells us what happens if Sue chose pizza, but it does not tell us what happens if Bob chose pasta. The second statement tells us that Bob chose pasta, but it does not provide any information about Sue's choice.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically infer that Sue chose pizza.\n\nAnswer: no",
