            "content": "To determine if we can logically infer that the car was red, we need to consider the given statements and the rules of logic. \n\n1. The first statement is \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q.\" In this case, P represents \"the car was red\" and Q represents \"the truck was blue.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"The truck was blue.\" This statement directly tells us that the truck was blue.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can analyze them together:\n\n- If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n- The truck was blue.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. Since we know that the truck was blue, it follows that the car must have been red based on the given conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can logically infer that the car was red. \n\nAnswer: yes",
