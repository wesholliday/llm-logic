In logic, the statement 'If A then B' means that if A is true, then B must be true. Given that 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad' and 'Kate ate salad' are both true, we can logically infer that Ben ate pasta if the first part of the statement is true.\n\nNow, as we know that 'Kate ate salad' is true, we need to evaluate the validity of the implication 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.' This statement does not tell us anything about whether Ben actually ate pasta; it only tells us that if he did, then Kate ate salad. It is possible that Kate ate salad for a different reason than Ben eating pasta.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that Ben ate pasta based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
