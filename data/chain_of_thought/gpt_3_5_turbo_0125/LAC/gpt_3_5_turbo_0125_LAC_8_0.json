However, this does not necessarily mean that if the mummy is awake, the vampire must also be awake. The first statement only establishes a one-way relationship from the vampire to the mummy, not the other way around.\n\nGiven that the mummy was awake, we cannot definitively conclude that the vampire was awake based on the information provided. The mummy being awake does not guarantee the vampire's state.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that the vampire was awake based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
