If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n2. The unicorn was in the forest.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was also in the forest. This means that the presence of the griffin in the forest implies the presence of the unicorn in the forest.\n\nGiven the second statement that the unicorn was in the forest, we can conclude that the unicorn was indeed in the forest.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer from these statements that the griffin was in the forest. The first statement only tells us about the relationship between the griffin and the unicorn, not the presence of the griffin in the forest.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically infer that the griffin was in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no",
