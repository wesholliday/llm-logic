The first statement is: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This is a conditional statement in the form of \"if p, then q.\" It does not provide any information about whether Ben actually ate pasta or not.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Kate ate salad.\" This statement directly tells us that Kate ate salad.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude that Ben ate pasta. The first statement only tells us about the relationship between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating salad, but it does not confirm whether Ben actually ate pasta. The fact that Kate ate salad does not provide direct evidence about Ben's food choice.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically infer that Ben ate pasta.\n\nAnswer: no",
