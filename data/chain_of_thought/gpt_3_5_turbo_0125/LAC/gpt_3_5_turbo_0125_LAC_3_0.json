We are also given that the book is a mystery novel. However, we cannot definitively conclude that the book was written by James based on this information alone. The first statement establishes a conditional relationship, but it does not provide information about the converse (if the book is a mystery novel, then it was written by James).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot logically infer that the book was written by James.\n\nAnswer: no",
