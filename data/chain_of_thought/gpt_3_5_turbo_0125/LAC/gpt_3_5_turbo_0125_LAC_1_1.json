The second premise states \"Sue was at the wedding,\" which can be represented as: Sue\n\nIf we combine these two premises, we have the conditional statement \"Mary \u27a1 Sue\" and the fact \"Sue\". \n\nGiven that the conditional statement \"Mary \u27a1 Sue\" is true and the fact that \"Sue\" is true, we can logically infer that Mary must also be at the wedding based on the implication. This is because if the condition of the implication (Mary) is true and the consequent (Sue) is also true, then the implication as a whole is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Mary was at the wedding based on the two premises provided.\n\nAnswer: yes",
