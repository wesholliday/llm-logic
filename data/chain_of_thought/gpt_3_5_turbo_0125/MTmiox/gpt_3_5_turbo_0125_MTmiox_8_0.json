This means that if the sprocket was cranked, it definitely was daggled.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that if the sprocket was cranked, it was daggled. Since the sprocket might not have been daggled, it implies that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
