It states that if the glip was slogged, then it must have tragged.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can analyze the implications:\n\n- If the glip was slogged, then it must have tragged.\n- The glip might not have tragged.\n\nFrom these statements, we cannot definitively infer that \"The glip was not slogged.\" This is because the first statement does not provide any information about whether the glip was slogged or not. It only talks about the consequence of the glip being slogged.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The glip was not slogged\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
