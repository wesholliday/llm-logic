It states that if the shank was plooked, then it must have been nugged.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer the following:\n\n- If the shank was plooked, then it must have been nugged.\n- It is possible that the shank was not nugged.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot definitively infer that the shank was not plooked. The first statement allows for the possibility that the shank was not nugged, but it does not provide enough information to determine whether the shank was plooked or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that the shank was not plooked.\n\nAnswer: no",
