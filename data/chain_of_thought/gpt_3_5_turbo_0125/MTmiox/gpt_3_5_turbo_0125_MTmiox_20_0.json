It states that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\n\nNow, let's combine the two statements:\n\n- If the fleeg was not surned, then it might not have been bluttered (contrapositive of statement 2).\n- Since the first statement allows for the possibility that the fleeg was not surned, we cannot definitively conclude that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that 'The fleeg was not bluttered' from the given statements.",
