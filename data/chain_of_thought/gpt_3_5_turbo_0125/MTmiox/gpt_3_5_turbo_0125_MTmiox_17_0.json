This can be represented as: Skizzled -> Movated.\n\nCombining the two statements:\n- The first statement does not provide direct information about skizzled or not skizzled.\n- The second statement links skizzled to movated: Skizzled -> Movated.\n\nFrom the given information, we cannot definitively infer that 'The flob was not skizzled' because the first statement does not provide any direct information about skizzled or not skizzled. The second statement only tells us about the relationship between skizzled and movated, not about the actual state of being skizzled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that 'The flob was not skizzled' based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
