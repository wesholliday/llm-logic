It only suggests a possibility regarding the garpling of the wug.\n\n2. \"If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled\" - This statement establishes a conditional relationship. If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot directly infer that \"The wug was not sproinged.\" The first statement does not provide information about the sproinging of the wug, and the second statement only tells us about the relationship between sproinging and garpling, not about the absence of sproinging.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The wug was not sproinged\" based on the given statements.",
