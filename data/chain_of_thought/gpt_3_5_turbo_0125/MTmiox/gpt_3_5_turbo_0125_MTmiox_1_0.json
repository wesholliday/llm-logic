This means that if the flugel was blimmed, it definitely was zargled.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that if the flugel was blimmed, it must have been zargled. Since the flugel might not have been zargled, it implies that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
