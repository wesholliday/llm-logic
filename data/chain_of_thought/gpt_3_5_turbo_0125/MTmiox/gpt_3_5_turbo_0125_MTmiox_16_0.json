It says that if the sneg was crampled, then it must have sproted the frink.\n\nCombining the two statements:\n\n- If the sneg did not sprot the frink, then it was not crampled (contrapositive of the second statement).\n- The first statement allows for the possibility that the sneg did not sprot the frink.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The sneg was not crampled\" from the given statements.",
