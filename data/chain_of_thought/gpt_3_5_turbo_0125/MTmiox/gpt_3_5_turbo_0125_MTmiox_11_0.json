It says that if the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed.\n\nCombining the two statements:\n\n- If the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed.\n- It is possible that the flug was not zimmed.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot definitively infer that \"The flug was not blummed.\" This is because the first statement only suggests a possibility that the flug was not zimmed, but it does not provide a definite conclusion about whether the flug was blummed or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The flug was not blummed' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
