It says that if the smip was shripped, then it must have lupped the zoint.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can reason as follows:\n- If the smip was shripped, then it must have lupped the zoint (from the second statement).\n- However, the first statement says that it is possible that the smip did not lup the zoint.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The smip was not shripped\" from the given statements because the first statement allows for the possibility that the smip did not lup the zoint, which would mean it was not shripped.",
