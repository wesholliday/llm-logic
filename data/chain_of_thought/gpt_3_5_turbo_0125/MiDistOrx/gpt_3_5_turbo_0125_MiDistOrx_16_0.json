            "content": "Explanation: In the original statement, \"The snorkel might be flibbit wibble or flump wibble\", the word \"it\" is not explicitly mentioned before \"flump wibble\". However, based on the structure of the sentence and the context, it is implied that the snorkel could be either \"flibbit wibble\" or \"flump wibble\". This implies that the snorkel might be one of the two options presented. Therefore, we can infer that the sentence means \"The snorkel might be flibbit wibble or it might be flump wibble\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
