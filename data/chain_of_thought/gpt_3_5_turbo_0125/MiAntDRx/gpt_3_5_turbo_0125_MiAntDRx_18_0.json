This means that the blimp could either have the quality of being zazzle with frozz or be on an plimp flump. Since the second part of the statement specifically mentions the blimp being on an plimp flump, we can infer that it is a possibility that the blimp might be on an plimp flump.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
