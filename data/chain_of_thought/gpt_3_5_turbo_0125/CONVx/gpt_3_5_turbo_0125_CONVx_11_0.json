The contrapositive of 'If P then Q' is 'If not Q then not P'.\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of the original statement 'If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed' is 'If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed'.\n\nBased on this logic, we cannot directly infer the statement 'If the flug was zimmed, then the flug was blummed' from the original statement provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
