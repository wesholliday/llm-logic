The first statement is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If A then B.\" In this case, A is \"the flugel was blimmed\" and B is \"the flugel was zargled.\"\n\nThe second statement is also a conditional statement: \"If B then A.\" In this case, B is \"the flugel was zargled\" and A is \"the flugel was blimmed.\"\n\nTo infer the second statement from the first, we need to check if the two statements are logically equivalent. In this case, they are not necessarily equivalent. Just because the flugel being blimmed implies it was zargled does not mean that the flugel being zargled implies it was blimmed. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first based on the information given.",
