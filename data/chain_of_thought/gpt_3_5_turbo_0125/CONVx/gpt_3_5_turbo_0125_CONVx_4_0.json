The original statement is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If A then B.\" In this case, A is \"the fribble was snurgled\" and B is \"the fribble crinked.\"\n\nWhen we have a conditional statement \"If A then B,\" it does not necessarily mean that \"If B then A\" is true. The original statement only tells us what happens if A occurs (snurgling), but it does not tell us what happens if B occurs (crinking).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the fribble crinked, then the fribble was snurgled\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
