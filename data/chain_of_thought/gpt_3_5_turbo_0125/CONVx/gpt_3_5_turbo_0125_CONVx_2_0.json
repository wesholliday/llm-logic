The first statement is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If A, then B.\" The second statement is also a conditional statement: \"If B, then A.\"\n\nIn general, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nTherefore, if we take the contrapositive of the first statement \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint,\" we get \"If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped.\"\n\nComparing the contrapositive of the first statement with the second statement \"If the wug bimmed the zoint, then the wug was flooped,\" we see that they are not logically equivalent. The contrapositive of the first statement does not match the second statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first statement. \n\nAnswer: no",
