The first statement is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If A then B.\" In this case, A is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and B is \"the dreb was spened.\"\n\nThe second statement is also a conditional statement: \"If B then A.\" In this case, B is \"the dreb was spened\" and A is \"the dreb was vroombed.\"\n\nTo infer the second statement from the first, we need to check if the two statements are logically equivalent. In other words, we need to determine if the truth of the first statement guarantees the truth of the second statement and vice versa.\n\nIn this case, we cannot infer the second statement from the first statement. Just because the dreb being vroombed implies that the dreb was spened, it does not necessarily mean that if the dreb was spened, then the dreb was vroombed. The two statements are not logically equivalent.\n\nTherefore, the second statement cannot be inferred from the first statement.",
