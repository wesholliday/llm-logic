The original statement is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If A then B.\" In this case, A is \"the smonk was vreebled\" and B is \"the smonk plagged.\"\n\nIn a conditional statement \"If A then B,\" the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A.\" \n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of the original statement \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged\" is \"If the smonk did not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled.\"\n\nNow, to infer the second statement \"If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was vreebled\" from the original statement, we need to check if it matches the contrapositive. \n\nAnswer: no",
