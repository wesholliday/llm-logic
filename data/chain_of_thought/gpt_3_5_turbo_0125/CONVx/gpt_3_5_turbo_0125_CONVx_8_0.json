The first statement is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If P then Q\" (If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled). \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P then Q\" is \"If not Q then not P.\" Therefore, if we take the contrapositive of the first statement, we get: \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\nGiven this information, we cannot directly infer the second statement from the first statement without additional information. The contrapositive of the first statement does not lead to the second statement. \n\nAnswer: no",
