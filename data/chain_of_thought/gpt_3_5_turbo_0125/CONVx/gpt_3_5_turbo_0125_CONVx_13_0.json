The original statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A then B.\" In this case, A is \"the glip was slogged\" and B is \"the glip was tragged.\"\n\nGiven the original statement \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged,\" we can rewrite it as \"If A then B.\" This means that whenever A occurs, B must also occur.\n\nNow, to infer the statement \"If the glip was tragged, then the glip was slogged,\" we would need to reverse the original conditional statement. This is known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A.\"\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of the original statement would be \"If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged.\" This is not the same as the statement we are trying to infer.\n\nSo, in this case, we cannot infer the statement \"If the glip was tragged, then the glip was slogged\" from the original statement \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
