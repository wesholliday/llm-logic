The original statement is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If A then B.\" In this case, A is \"the splat was morphed\" and B is \"the splat quanked.\"\n\nIn a conditional statement \"If A then B,\" the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A.\" \n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of the original statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" is \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed.\"\n\nGiven this, we cannot directly infer the statement \"If the splat quanked, then the splat was morphed\" from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: no",
