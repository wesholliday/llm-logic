In this case, we cannot directly infer the statement 'If the wug was garpled, then it was sproinged' from the original statement without additional information or logical reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the statement 'If the wug was garpled, then it was sproinged' cannot be inferred from the given statement 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled'.\n\nAnswer: no",
