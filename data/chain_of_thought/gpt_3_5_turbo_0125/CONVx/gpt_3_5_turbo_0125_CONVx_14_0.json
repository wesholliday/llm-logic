This is known as the converse of the original statement.\n\nIn logic, the converse of a conditional statement is not always true. Just because P implies Q does not mean that Q implies P. Therefore, we cannot directly infer the statement \"If the clug snugged, then the clug was fleeked\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
