The original statement is in the form \"If A then B.\" This does not necessarily mean that \"If B then A\" is true. In logic, the contrapositive of \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A.\" \n\nGiven the original statement \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished,\" the contrapositive would be \"If the twonk was not varnished, then it was not plinked.\" \n\nTherefore, we cannot directly infer \"If the twonk was varnished, then it was plinked\" from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: no",
