The original statement is in the form \"If A then B.\" This does not necessarily mean that \"If B then A\" is true. In logic, the contrapositive of \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A.\" \n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\" is \"If the sneg did not sprot the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\" This is not the same as \"If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
