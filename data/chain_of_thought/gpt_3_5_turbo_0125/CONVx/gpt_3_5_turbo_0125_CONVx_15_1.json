The original statement is: If A then B (If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened).\n2. For the reverse implication, we need to check if B then A is valid (If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was vroombed).\n3. To determine if the reverse implication holds, we need to assess if the original statement satisfies the definition of a symmetric relationship.\n4. In a symmetric relationship, A implies B and B implies A.\n5. If the original statement had been \"If and only if the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\", it would have been a symmetric relationship.\n6.
