Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nFrom the first statement, if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. Since we know Lucy went to the zoo from the second statement, it implies that Joe must have gone to the park based on the first statement. This is because the first statement establishes a conditional relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo. If the condition is met (Lucy going to the zoo), then the consequent (Joe going to the park) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Joe went to the park based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
