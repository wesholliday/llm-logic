Sue was at the wedding.\n\nBased on the first statement, if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. Since we know Sue was at the wedding from the second statement, it implies that Mary must have been at the wedding as well. This is because if Mary was at the wedding, Sue would be there too according to the first statement. Therefore, we can infer that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
