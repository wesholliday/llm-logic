(Conditional statement)\n2. Erin took a train. (Given information)\n\nFrom the given information, we know that Erin took a train. However, this does not necessarily mean that Sam took a plane.

But it does not provide any information about what mode of transportation Sam actually took.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that Sam took a plane.\n\nAnswer: no",
