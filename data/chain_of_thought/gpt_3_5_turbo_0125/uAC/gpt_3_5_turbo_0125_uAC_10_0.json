The cat was outside.\n\nBased on the first statement, if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. Since the cat was outside, it implies that the dog was inside. This is because the first statement establishes a conditional relationship between the dog being inside and the cat being outside. If the cat is outside, it must mean that the dog was inside according to the given condition.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the dog was inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
