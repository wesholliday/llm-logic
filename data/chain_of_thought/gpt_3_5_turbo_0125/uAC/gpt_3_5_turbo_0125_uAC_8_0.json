(Vampire awake -> Mummy awake)\n2. The mummy was awake. \n\nFrom the given information, we know that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. Since we are also given that the mummy was awake, we can conclude that the vampire must have been awake as well. This is because if the mummy was awake, it implies that the vampire was also awake based on the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the vampire was awake. \n\nAnswer: yes",
