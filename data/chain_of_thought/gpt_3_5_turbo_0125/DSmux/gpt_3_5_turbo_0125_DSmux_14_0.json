So, it can be represented as: (C is F) \u2228 (C is S).\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the clug must be snugged\": This statement can be represented as: \u00ac(C is S).\n\nNow, if we combine the two statements, we have:\n(C is F) \u2228 (C is S)\n\u00ac(C is S)\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the clug must be fleeked because if it's not snugged, then it must be fleeked according to the first statement. Therefore, we can infer \"The clug is fleeked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
