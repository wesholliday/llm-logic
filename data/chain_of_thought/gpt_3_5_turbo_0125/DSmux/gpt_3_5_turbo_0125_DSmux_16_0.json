(S \u2192 C)\n2. S \u2227 \u00acS\n\nFrom the second statement, we can infer that S is false (\u00acS is true). Therefore, we can substitute false for S in the first statement:\n\n1. (False \u2192 C)\n\nSince the antecedent of a conditional statement being false makes the entire statement true, we can conclude that C (crampled) must be true. Therefore, we can infer \"The sneg is crampled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
