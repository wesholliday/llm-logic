The first statement is: \"Either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the shank must be nugged.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged. Since the second statement tells us that it's not the case that the shank must be nugged, we can conclude that the shank is plooked.\n\nTherefore, the inference that \"The shank is plooked\" can be made from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
