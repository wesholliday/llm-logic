So, if the grommet is not plopped, then it must be sploffed.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped\": This statement tells us that the grommet is not required to be plopped.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that if the grommet is not required to be plopped, then it must be sploffed. Therefore, we can infer that \"The grommet is sploffed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
