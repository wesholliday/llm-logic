Combining the two statements, we have:\n(Fleeg is bluttered) OR (NOT (Fleeg must be surned)).\n\n4. From the above combined statement, we can infer that if it's not the case that the fleeg must be surned, then the fleeg must be bluttered.\n\nTherefore, the inference \"The fleeg is bluttered\" can be made from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
