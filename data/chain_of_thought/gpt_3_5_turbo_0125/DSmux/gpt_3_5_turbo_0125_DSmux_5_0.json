ZF \u2228 MS\n2. \u00acMS\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that it is not the case that the zinger must be smoogled (\u00acMS). Since the zinger must be either fraggled or smoogled according to the first statement (ZF \u2228 MS), and we know it is not smoogled, then the zinger must be fraggled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The zinger is fraggled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
