The first statement is: \"Either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the flob must be movated.\"\n\nCombining the two statements:\n- If the flob is not required to be movated, then it must be skizzled according to the first statement.\n- Therefore, we can infer that \"The flob is skizzled\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
