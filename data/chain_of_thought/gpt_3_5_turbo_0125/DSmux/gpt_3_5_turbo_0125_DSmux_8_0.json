Since the second statement tells us that it's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled, we can conclude that the sprocket must be cranked. This is because if it's not necessary for the sprocket to be daggled, and the first statement tells us that it must be one of the two options, then it must be cranked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The sprocket is cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
