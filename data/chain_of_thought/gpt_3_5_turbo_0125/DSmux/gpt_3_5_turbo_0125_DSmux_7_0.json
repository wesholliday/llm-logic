Let's denote:\n- A: The whiffle is shanked\n- B: The whiffle is tinked\n\n2. The first statement can be represented as: A or B\n3. The second statement can be represented as: ~B (It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked)\n\nGiven the statements:\n- Either the whiffle is shanked or it must be tinked (A or B)\n- It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked (~B)\n\nFrom the given statements, we can infer that if it's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked (~B), then the whiffle must be shanked (A). This is because if B is false, then A must be true in the statement A or B.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The whiffle is shanked' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
