So, it can be represented as: S \u2228 G.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the wug must be garpled\": This statement tells us that the wug is not necessarily garpled. In other words, it is not the case that the wug must be garpled, which can be represented as: \u00acG.\n\nNow, if we combine the two statements, we have:\n(S \u2228 G) \u2227 \u00acG\n\nBy applying the rule of simplification, we can simplify the above expression to just S:\nS\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that \"The wug is sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
