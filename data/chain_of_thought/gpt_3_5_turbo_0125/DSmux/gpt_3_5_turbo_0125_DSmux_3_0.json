Statement 1: \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked.\"\n   - This statement indicates that one of the two conditions must be true: either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked.\n\n2. Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked.\"\n   - This statement negates the possibility that the splat must be quanked.\n\nCombining the two statements:\n- Since it's not the case that the splat must be quanked, the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that \"the splat is morphed.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The splat is morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
