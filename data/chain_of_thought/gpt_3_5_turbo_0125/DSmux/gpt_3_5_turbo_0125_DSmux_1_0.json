So, it can be represented as: (F \u2192 B) \u2228 (F \u2192 Z)\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled\": This statement can be represented as: \u00ac(F \u2192 Z)\n\nNow, let's combine the two statements:\n\n1. (F \u2192 B) \u2228 (F \u2192 Z)\n2. \u00ac(F \u2192 Z)\n\nFrom the second statement, we can infer \u00acF \u2228 Z (by the contrapositive of the implication). \n\nNow, let's combine this with the first statement:\n\n1. (F \u2192 B) \u2228 (F \u2192 Z)\n2. \u00acF \u2228 Z\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot directly infer 'The flugel is blimmed' (B). The given information does not provide enough evidence to conclude that the flugel is blimmed.",
