(Premise)\n2. The truck was not metal. (Premise)\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer the contrapositive: If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic. This is based on the logical equivalence between a statement and its contrapositive in a conditional statement.\n\n3. If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic. (Inference from premise 1)\n4. The truck was not metal. (Premise)\n\nFrom premises 3 and 4, we can conclude that the doll was not plastic, based on modus tollens, which states that if a conditional statement and its negation are true, then the antecedent of the conditional statement is false.\n\n5. The doll was not plastic. (Conclusion)\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
