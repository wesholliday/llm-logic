            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze it using the rules of inference. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. (Premise)\n2. Bob did not choose pasta. (Premise)\n3. Sue did not choose pizza. (Conclusion)\n\nBy examining the premises and conclusion, we can see that the argument follows the form of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens states that if a conditional statement is true and the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false. In this case, if the first premise is true (If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta) and the second premise is true (Bob did not choose pasta), then the conclusion (Sue did not choose pizza) logically follows.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
