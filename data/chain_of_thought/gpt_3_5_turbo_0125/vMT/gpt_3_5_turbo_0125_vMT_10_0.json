(Premise)\n2. The cat was not outside. (Premise)\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer the contrapositive: If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside. This is a valid logical inference based on the contrapositive rule.\n\nTherefore, given the premises and the valid inference, the conclusion \"The dog was not inside\" logically follows from the premises. \n\nAnswer: yes",
