            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze it using the rules of logical inference. The argument is structured as a conditional statement in the first premise and a negation of the consequent in the second premise. This aligns with the form of modus tollens, a valid form of argumentation in propositional logic. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P then Q\" and we know that Q is false, then we can infer that P is also false.\n\nGiven that the first premise is 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' and the second premise is 'Lucy did not go to the zoo', we can apply modus tollens to conclude that 'Joe did not go to the park'. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
