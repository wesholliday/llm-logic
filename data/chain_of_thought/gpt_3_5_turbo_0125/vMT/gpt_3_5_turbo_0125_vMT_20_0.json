            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze it using the rules of logical reasoning. \n\n1. The first premise states: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be represented as: A \u2192 B (If A, then B).\n\n2. The second premise states: \"The banana was not yellow.\" This can be represented as: \u00acB (Not B).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The apple was not red.\" This can be represented as: \u00acA (Not A).\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\n- If the apple was red (A), then the banana was yellow (B). This is the first premise: A \u2192 B.\n- The banana was not yellow (\u00acB). This is the second premise.\n- From the first premise, if the apple was red (A), then the banana was yellow (B). Since the banana was not yellow (\u00acB), it follows that the apple was not red (\u00acA).\n\nTherefore, based on the premises and the logical implications, the conclusion \"The apple was not red\" logically follows from the premises \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" and \"The banana was not yellow.\" \n\nAnswer: yes",
