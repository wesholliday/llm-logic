The truck was not blue (Premise)\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer the contrapositive: If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red. This is based on the logical equivalence of a conditional statement and its contrapositive.\n\n3. If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red (Inferred from premise 1)\n4. The truck was not blue (Premise)\n\nFrom premises 3 and 4, we can conclude that the car was not red. This is a valid application of modus tollens, a valid form of deductive reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
