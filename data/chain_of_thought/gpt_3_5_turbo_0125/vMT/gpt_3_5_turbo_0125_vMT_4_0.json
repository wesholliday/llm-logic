If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter (Premise)\n2. The robot did not visit Jupiter (Premise)\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer the contrapositive: If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars. This is based on the logical equivalence of a conditional statement and its contrapositive.\n\nGiven premise 2 states that the robot did not visit Jupiter, we can now conclude that the alien did not visit Mars based on the contrapositive of premise 1.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
