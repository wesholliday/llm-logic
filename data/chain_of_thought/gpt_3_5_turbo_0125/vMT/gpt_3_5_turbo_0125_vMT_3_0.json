If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. (Premise)\n2. The book is not a mystery novel. (Premise)\n\nFrom the first premise, we can infer the contrapositive: If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James. This is a valid logical inference based on the contrapositive rule.\n\nGiven that the second premise states that the book is not a mystery novel, we can then logically conclude that the book was not written by James based on the contrapositive of the first premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
