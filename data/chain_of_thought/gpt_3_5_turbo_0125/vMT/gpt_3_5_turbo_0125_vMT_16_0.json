(Premise)\n2. The pants were not denim. (Premise)\n\nFrom the first premise, we can infer the contrapositive: If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton. This is based on the logical equivalence of a conditional statement and its contrapositive.\n\nTherefore, if the pants were not denim (as stated in the second premise), then we can conclude that the shirt was not cotton based on the contrapositive of the first premise.\n\nSo, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
