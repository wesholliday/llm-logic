            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze it using the rules of deductive reasoning. \n\n1. The first premise states: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be represented as: J \u2192 A.\n2. The second premise states: \"Amy did not play tennis.\" This can be represented as: \u00acA.\n3. The conclusion is: \"Jeff did not play basketball.\" This can be represented as: \u00acJ.\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\n1. J \u2192 A (If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis)\n2. \u00acA (Amy did not play tennis)\n\nFrom the first premise, if Jeff played basketball (J), then Amy played tennis (A). Since Amy did not play tennis (\u00acA), we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball (\u00acJ) based on the first premise. This is a valid application of modus tollens, a valid form of deductive reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
