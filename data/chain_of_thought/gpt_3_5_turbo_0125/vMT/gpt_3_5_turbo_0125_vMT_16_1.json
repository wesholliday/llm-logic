Assume the shirt was cotton.\n2. Assume the pants were not denim.\n\nGiven premise 1, if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. But in this scenario, we are assuming the pants were not denim. This contradicts the premise that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. Therefore, our assumption that the shirt was cotton leads to a contradiction.\n\nSince our assumption leads to a contradiction, the opposite must be true. Therefore, if the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton. This reasoning validates the conclusion based on the premises provided.\n\nAnswer: yes",
