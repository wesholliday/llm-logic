The first premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. The second premise states that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. From these two premises, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, based on the contrapositive of the first premise.\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. (Premise)\n2. Mark did not buy the blue shirt. (Premise)\n3. Therefore, Lisa did not buy the red shirt. (Conclusion)\n\nBy applying the contrapositive of the first premise, we can see that the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.",
