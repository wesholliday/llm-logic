The first premise states: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This can be represented as: If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q).\n\n2. The second premise states: \"Erin did not take a train.\" This can be represented as: \u00acQ.\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Sam did not take a plane.\" This can be represented as: \u00acP.\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\n1. If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train (P \u2192 Q).\n2. Erin did not take a train (\u00acQ).\n\nFrom the premises, we can infer that Erin did not take a train (\u00acQ). However, this does not necessarily mean that Sam did not take a plane (\u00acP). It is possible that Sam took a plane and Erin did not take a train, as the first premise only establishes a conditional relationship between Sam taking a plane and Erin taking a train.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises. \n\nAnswer: no",
