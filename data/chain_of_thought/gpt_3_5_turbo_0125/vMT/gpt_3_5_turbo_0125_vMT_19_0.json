The argument is structured as a conditional statement in the form of a hypothetical syllogism:\n\n1. If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n2. Jen did not watch basketball.\n3. Therefore, Tom did not watch football.\n\nGiven the premises, if we assume that the first premise is true (If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball) and the second premise is true (Jen did not watch basketball), then the conclusion (Tom did not watch football) logically follows. This is because if the first premise is true and Jen did not watch basketball, then it must be the case that Tom did not watch football.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
