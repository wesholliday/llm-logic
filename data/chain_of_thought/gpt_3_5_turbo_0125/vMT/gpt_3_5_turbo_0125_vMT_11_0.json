            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze it using the rules of deductive reasoning. The argument is structured as a conditional statement in the first premise, which states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. The second premise states that the muffins were not blueberry. From these premises, we can infer that the cake was not chocolate based on the conditional relationship established in the first premise.\n\n1. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry (P \u2192 Q)\n2. The muffins were not blueberry (~Q)\n\nFrom the first premise, if the cake was chocolate (P), then the muffins were blueberry (Q). Since the muffins were not blueberry (~Q), we can conclude that the cake was not chocolate (~P) based on the contrapositive of the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
