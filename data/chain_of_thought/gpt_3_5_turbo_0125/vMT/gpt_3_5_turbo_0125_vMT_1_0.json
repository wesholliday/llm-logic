            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze it using the rules of inference. The argument is a modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, then we can conclude that A is also false. \n\nIn this case:\n- Premise 1: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (If Mary, then Sue)\n- Premise 2: Sue was not at the wedding (~Sue)\n\nUsing modus tollens:\n- If Mary, then Sue\n- Not Sue\n- Therefore, Not Mary\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
