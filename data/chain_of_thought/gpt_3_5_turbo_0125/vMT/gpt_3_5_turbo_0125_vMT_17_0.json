The first premise states: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This can be represented as: Ben ate pasta \u2192 Kate ate salad.\n\n2. The second premise states: \"Kate did not eat salad.\" This can be represented as: \u00acKate ate salad.\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Ben did not eat pasta.\" This can be represented as: \u00acBen ate pasta.\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nIf Ben ate pasta \u2192 Kate ate salad (Premise 1)\n\u00acKate ate salad (Premise 2)\n\nFrom the premises, we can infer that Kate did not eat salad. Since the first premise states that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad, and Kate did not eat salad, we can conclude that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
