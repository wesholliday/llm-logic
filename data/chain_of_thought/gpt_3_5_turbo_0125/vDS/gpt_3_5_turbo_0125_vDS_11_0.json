The first premise states that the newspaper is either in the driveway or on the porch. The second premise states that the newspaper is not on the porch. Given these premises, if the newspaper is not on the porch and it must be either in the driveway or on the porch, then the only remaining option is that the newspaper is in the driveway. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
