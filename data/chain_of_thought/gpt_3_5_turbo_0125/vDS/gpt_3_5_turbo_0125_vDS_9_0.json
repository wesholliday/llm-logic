The argument is structured as a disjunction (either/or statement) in the first premise, and the second premise provides information that eliminates one of the options. If the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor, then it must be in the box based on the first premise. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
