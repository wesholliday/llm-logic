The argument is in the form of a disjunction (either/or statement) in the first premise and a negation in the second premise. \n\n1. Either the keys are in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet.\n2. The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet.\n3. Therefore, the keys are in the drawer.\n\nGiven the first premise is a disjunction, it means that at least one of the two options must be true. The second premise states that one of the options (dangling in the cabinet) is false. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the keys are in the drawer. \n\nThis argument is logically valid because the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\nAnswer: yes",
