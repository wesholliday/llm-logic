The argument is in the form of a disjunction (either/or statement) in the first premise, and a negation in the second premise. \n\n1. Either the pen is in my bag or it is on my desk.\n2. The pen isn't on my desk.\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that the pen must be in one of the two places mentioned. The second premise tells us that the pen is not on the desk. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the pen must be in the bag. \n\nGiven the premises and the logical connection between them, the conclusion necessarily follows. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
