The argument is in the form of a disjunction (either/or statement) in the first premise, and the second premise provides information that Fido is not in the garden. Given that Fido must be either inside or in the garden, and the second premise rules out the possibility of Fido being in the garden, the only remaining option is that Fido is inside. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
