The argument is structured as a disjunction (either/or statement) in the first premise, and the second premise provides a negation of one of the options. In this case, if the missing sock is not under the bed, then it must be in the laundry basket based on the first premise. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
