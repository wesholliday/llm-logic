The first premise states that the toy is either in the toy box or sitting on the shelf. The second premise states that the toy is not sitting on the shelf. Given these premises, if the toy is not sitting on the shelf, then it must be in the toy box based on the first premise. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
