The first premise states that either the cat is napping on the couch or it's playing in the bedroom. The second premise states that the cat isn't playing in the bedroom. Given these premises, if the cat is not playing in the bedroom, then the only remaining option from the first premise is that the cat must be napping on the couch. Therefore, the conclusion 'The cat is napping on the couch' logically follows from the premises. \n\nAnswer: yes",
