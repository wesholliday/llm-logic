The argument is in the form of a disjunction (either/or statement) in the first premise and a negation in the second premise. \n\n1. Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it is hanging in the closet.\n2. The jacket isn't hanging in the closet.\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that if the jacket is not hanging in the closet, then it must be draped over the chair because those are the only two options given. Therefore, the conclusion 'The jacket is draped over the chair' logically follows from the premises. \n\nAnswer: yes",
