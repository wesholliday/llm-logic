The argument is structured as a disjunction (either/or statement) in the first premise, and the negation of one of the options in the second premise. If one of the options in the disjunction is false, then the other option must be true. Therefore, if the watch is not on his wrist (as stated in the second premise), then it must be charging on the dresser (as concluded in the argument). This argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
