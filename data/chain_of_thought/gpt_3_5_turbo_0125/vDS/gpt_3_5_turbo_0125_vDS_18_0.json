The first premise states that the notebook is either in the drawer or on the nightstand. The second premise states that the notebook is not on the nightstand. Given these premises, if the notebook is not on the nightstand, then it must be in the drawer based on the first premise. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
