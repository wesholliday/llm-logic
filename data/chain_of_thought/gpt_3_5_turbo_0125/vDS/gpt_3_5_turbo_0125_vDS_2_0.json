The first premise states that the book is either on the shelf or resting on the table, which covers all possible options. The second premise states that the book is not resting on the table. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the book must be on the shelf. This aligns with the conclusion that the book is on the shelf. \n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
