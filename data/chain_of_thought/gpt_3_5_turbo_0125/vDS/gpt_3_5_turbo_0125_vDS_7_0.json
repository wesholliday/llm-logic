The argument is in the form of a disjunction (either/or statement) in the first premise and a negation in the second premise. The conclusion drawn is based on the disjunctive syllogism rule, which states that if one disjunct is false, then the other must be true.\n\n1. Either the umbrella is in the car or it is tucked away in the closet.\n2. The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet.\n3. Therefore, the umbrella is in the car.\n\nGiven the premises, if the umbrella is not tucked away in the closet (as stated in premise 2), then according to the disjunctive syllogism rule, the only remaining option from the first premise is that the umbrella is in the car. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
