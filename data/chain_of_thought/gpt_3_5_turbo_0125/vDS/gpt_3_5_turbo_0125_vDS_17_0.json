The argument is in the form of a disjunction (either/or statement) in the first premise, and a negation in the second premise. The conclusion drawn is the only remaining option from the disjunction after eliminating the option negated in the second premise. This is a valid form of argument known as disjunctive syllogism. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
