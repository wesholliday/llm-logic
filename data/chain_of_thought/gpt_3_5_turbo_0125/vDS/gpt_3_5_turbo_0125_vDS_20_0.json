The argument is in the form of a disjunction (either/or statement) in the first premise, and a negation in the second premise. The conclusion drawn is based on the disjunctive syllogism rule, which states that if one disjunct is false, then the other must be true.\n\n1. Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they are perched on her head.\n2. The sunglasses aren't perched on her head.\n3. Therefore, the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nGiven the premises and the conclusion, the argument follows the disjunctive syllogism rule correctly. If the sunglasses are not perched on her head (as stated in the second premise), then according to the disjunctive syllogism rule, they must be in her bag (the other option in the first premise). Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
