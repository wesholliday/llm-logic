'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden'\n\nLooking at the first premise, 'Fido might not be in the garden', it indicates that Fido may not be in the garden, suggesting the possibility that Fido is elsewhere.\n\nNow, let's focus on the second premise, 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden'. This statement presents two options: either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden. If Fido is not in the garden (as suggested by the first premise), then according to the second premise, Fido must be inside.\n\nCombining the information from both premises, if Fido might not be in the garden and one of the options presented is that Fido must be inside, we can indeed infer that 'Fido is inside.'\n\nAnswer: yes",
