The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" negates the possibility of the book being exclusively on the table.  \nThis means that the book can be either on the table or on the shelf.  \nSo, the possibilities are:  \nA = Book not on table, may be on shelf  \nA' = Book on table\n\n3. The statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" tells us that the book must be on either the shelf or the table but not both.  \nThis means that if the book is not on the table (A'), then it must be on the shelf (A) since the third option of being on the table is negated by A.\n\n4.
