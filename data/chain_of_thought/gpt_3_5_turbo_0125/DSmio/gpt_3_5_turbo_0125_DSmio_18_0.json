Therefore, the notebook must be in the drawer.\n\nNow, let's put it all together:\n\n1. The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\n2. Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
