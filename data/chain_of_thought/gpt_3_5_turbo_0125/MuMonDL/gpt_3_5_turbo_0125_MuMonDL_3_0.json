When we say \"The keys must be in the drawer or on the table\", it means the keys could be in the drawer or on the table, or even both. Since we already know the keys are in the drawer, it is possible that they are also on the table. Therefore, we can infer that \"The keys must be in the drawer or on the table\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
