This means that the exam was difficult and it covered all chapters, but it does not necessarily mean that the exam covered all chapters. It is possible that the exam covered all chapters and was difficult, but it could also be the case that the exam was difficult for reasons other than covering all chapters. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the exam must have covered all chapters based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
