This means that the restaurant was closed on Mondays and served Italian cuisine, but it does not necessarily mean that the restaurant only served Italian cuisine. It is possible that the restaurant served other types of cuisine as well. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the restaurant must have served Italian cuisine based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
