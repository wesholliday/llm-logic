The original statement specifies two conditions: the meeting must have been at 2 PM and in the conference room. This means that both conditions must be met for the meeting to have taken place. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the meeting must have been in the conference room without knowing if it was also at 2 PM.\n\nAnswer: No",
