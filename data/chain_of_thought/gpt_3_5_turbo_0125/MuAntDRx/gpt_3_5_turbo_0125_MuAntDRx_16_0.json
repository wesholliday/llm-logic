In this case, the original statement is \"The wozzle must be flibbit floob or flibbit blimple.\" This means that the wozzle must be either flibbit floob or flibbit blimple. If we know that the wozzle must be flibbit floob or flibbit blimple, we cannot infer that the wozzle must be specifically flibbit blimple because it could still be flibbit floob.\n\nAnswer: no",
