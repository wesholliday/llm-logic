In this case, the original statement is \"The wump must be froodle, fribble, flimble, or quank.\" Since \"quank\" is one of the options listed, the statement is true as long as the wump is quank or any of the other options. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The wump must be quank\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
