So, if we know that \"The floob must be in the bimboozle or on the quibble\" is true, it means that the floob could be in the bimboozle, on the quibble, or even in both places. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The floob must be on the quibble\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
