This premise states that it is not a definite requirement for the alien to have visited Mars.\nConclusion: The alien might not have visited Mars. This conclusion derives from the premise, suggesting a possibility that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nIn this argument, the conclusion ('The alien might not have visited Mars') does not necessarily follow from the premise ('It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars') with logical certainty. The premise only indicates that it is not a must for the alien to have visited Mars, but it doesn't definitively confirm that the alien did not visit Mars. The conclusion, therefore, goes beyond what the premise establishes.\n\nGiven that the conclusion goes beyond what is provided in the premise and is not logically necessitated by the premise, this form of argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: no",
