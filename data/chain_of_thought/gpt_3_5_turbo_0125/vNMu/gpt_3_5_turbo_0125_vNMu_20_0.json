The premise states \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\" This can be rewritten as \"It is possible that the sunglasses are not in her bag.\"\n\n2. The conclusion states \"The sunglasses might not be in her bag.\" This aligns with the rewritten premise.\n\nGiven that the premise and conclusion are essentially saying the same thing, just in slightly different ways, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
