This can be restated as \"It is possible that the griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nThe conclusion states that the griffin might not have been in the forest. This aligns with the restated premise, as both express the possibility that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows logically from the premise. \n\nAnswer: yes",
