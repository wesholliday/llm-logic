The premise states: 'It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter'. This can be translated as 'It is not necessary for the milk to be on the counter'.\n\n2. The conclusion states: 'The milk might not be on the counter'. This can be translated as 'It is possible that the milk is not on the counter'.\n\nGiven the premise that it is not necessary for the milk to be on the counter, it logically follows that it is possible for the milk not to be on the counter. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
