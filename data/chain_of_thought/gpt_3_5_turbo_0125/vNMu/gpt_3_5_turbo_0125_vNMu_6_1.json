This conclusion aligns with the premise, as both are suggesting the possibility that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nBased on the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows from the premise.

The premise states that \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza,\" which can be represented as \u00ac(Sue must have chosen pizza). The conclusion is \"Sue might not have chosen pizza,\" which can be represented as \u2203x(Sue might not have chosen pizza), where \u2203x represents the existential quantifier meaning \"there exists.\" The original premise can also be rewritten as \u00ac(\u2200xSue must have chosen pizza), using the universal quantifier \u2200x meaning \"for all.\"\n\nTherefore, the argument can be symbolized as:\nPremise: \u00ac(\u2200xSue must have chosen pizza)\nConclusion: \u2203x(Sue might not have chosen pizza)\n\nTo validate the argument form, we can use a logical rule that relates the negation of a universal quantifier to the existence of a negation. In formal logic, this rule is known as De Morgan's law for quantifiers. De Morgan's law for quantifiers states that \u00ac(\u2200xP(x)) is equivalent to \u2203x\u00acP(x).\n\nBy applying De Morgan's law for quantifiers to the premise of the argument, we get:\nPremise: \u2203x\u00ac(Sue must have chosen pizza)\n\nNow we can see that the form of the argument matches the valid logical structure, where the premise asserts the existence of a negation of a statement regarding Sue's choice, and the conclusion also talks about the possibility of a negation of Sue's choice.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
