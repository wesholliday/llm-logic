The premise \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" can be translated as \"It is not necessary that Sue chose pizza\" or \"Sue did not necessarily choose pizza.\" The conclusion \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" can be translated as \"It is possible that Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n\nGiven these translations, the argument form is valid. If it is not necessary that Sue chose pizza, then it is possible that she did not choose pizza. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
