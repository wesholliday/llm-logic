Since the unicorn was indeed in the forest according to the second statement, it satisfies the condition of the first statement.\n\nHowever, the truth of the conditional statement \"If A then B\" does not necessarily imply the truth of \"If B then A.\" In this case, just because the unicorn was in the forest does not guarantee that the griffin was also in the forest. The griffin could be somewhere else or even in the forest, but we cannot definitively conclude its location based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that \"The griffin was in the forest\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
