This means that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. This statement does not tell us anything about what happens if the shirt was not cotton.\n\n2. \"The pants were denim\" is a simple statement that tells us the pants were denim.\n\nGiven these statements, we know that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. We also know that the pants were denim. However, we do not have any information about what happens if the shirt was not cotton. It is possible that the shirt was not cotton and the pants were still denim. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that 'The shirt was cotton' is necessarily true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
