Since the second statement confirms that the wolf was indeed in the den, it does not provide any information about the bear's location. The bear could be in the cave or somewhere else.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that the bear was necessarily in the cave. \n\nAnswer: no",
