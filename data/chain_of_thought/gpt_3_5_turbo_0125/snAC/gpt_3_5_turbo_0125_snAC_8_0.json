Since the mummy was indeed awake according to the second statement, it confirms the first statement that the vampire was awake. This is because the first statement establishes a logical connection between the vampire and the mummy's states of being awake.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, it necessarily follows that 'The vampire was awake' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
