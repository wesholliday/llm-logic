Since the second statement confirms that Lucy did go to the zoo, it does not necessarily mean that Joe went to the park. The first statement only establishes a condition for Lucy's visit to the zoo if Joe went to the park, but it does not provide any information about Joe's actual visit to the park.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that Joe went to the park.\n\nAnswer: no",
