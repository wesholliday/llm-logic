The statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is true.\n2. The mummy was awake.\n\nGiven these two statements, we know that the mummy was awake because it is explicitly mentioned. Furthermore, the conditional statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" being true implies that whenever the vampire is awake, the mummy is also awake. However, this conditional statement doesn't provide direct information about the status of the vampire when the mummy is awake. It only establishes the condition for the mummy's wakefulness when the vampire is awake.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude whether the vampire was awake or not, as there is no direct evidence to support either case. The truth value of 'The vampire was awake' remains indeterminate given the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
