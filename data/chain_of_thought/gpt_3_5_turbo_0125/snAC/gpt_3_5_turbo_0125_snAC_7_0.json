This does not guarantee that Alex finished the race, as Chris could have finished the race without Alex doing so.\n\n2. \"Chris finished the race\" being true only tells us that Chris finished the race. It does not provide direct information about Alex's performance.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that Alex necessarily finished the race. \n\nAnswer: no",
