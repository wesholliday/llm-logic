However, we cannot definitively determine the color of the car based on this information alone. The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" only tells us about a hypothetical scenario, not a definite fact about the color of the car.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that \"The car was red\" is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
