The first statement given is: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is true. This is a conditional statement in the form of \"if-then.\" It does not tell us whether Mary was actually at the wedding, only that if she was, then Sue was also there.\n\n2. The second statement given is: \"Sue was at the wedding\" is true. This statement directly tells us that Sue was indeed at the wedding.\n\nGiven these two statements, we know that Sue was at the wedding. However, we do not have any information that directly confirms whether Mary was at the wedding. The first statement only tells us about the relationship between Mary and Sue if Mary was at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively conclude that Mary was at the wedding. \n\nAnswer: no",
