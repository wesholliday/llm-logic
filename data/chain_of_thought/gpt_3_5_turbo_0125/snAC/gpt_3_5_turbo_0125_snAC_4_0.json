Since the second statement tells us that the robot visited Jupiter, we can conclude that the first part of the conditional statement is true. \n\nHowever, we cannot definitively conclude that the alien visited Mars based on the given information. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if the alien visited Mars, but it does not provide any information about what happens if the alien did not visit Mars. Therefore, we cannot say for certain that the alien visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: no",
