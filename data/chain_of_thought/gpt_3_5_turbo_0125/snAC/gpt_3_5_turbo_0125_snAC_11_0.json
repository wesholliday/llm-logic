Since the second statement confirms that the muffins were indeed blueberry, it satisfies the condition of the first statement.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively conclude that the cake was chocolate based solely on the given information. The first statement only establishes a conditional relationship between the cake being chocolate and the muffins being blueberry. It does not provide any information about the cake itself.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that \"The cake was chocolate\" is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
