The first statement is a conditional statement: 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.' This means that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate definitely ate salad. However, it does not tell us anything about whether Ben actually ate pasta.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: 'Kate ate salad.' This statement tells us that Kate did eat salad.\n\nGiven this information, we know that Kate ate salad, but we do not have any direct information about whether Ben ate pasta. Just because Kate ate salad does not necessarily mean that Ben ate pasta. Kate could have eaten salad for a different reason or at a different time.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that 'Ben ate pasta' is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
