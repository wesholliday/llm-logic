The first statement is a conditional statement, and we only know the truth value of the conclusion (Mark bought the blue shirt), not the hypothesis (Lisa bought the red shirt). Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
