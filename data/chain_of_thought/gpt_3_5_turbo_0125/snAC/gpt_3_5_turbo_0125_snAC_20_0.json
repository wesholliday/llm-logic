Since the second statement confirms that the banana was indeed yellow, it satisfies the condition in the first statement.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the first statement does not provide any information about what happens if the apple was not red. It only establishes a relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana when the apple is red.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that the apple was red. The apple could be red or another color, and the given statements would still be consistent.\n\nAnswer: no",
