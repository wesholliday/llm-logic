The original statement is \"the jacket must be draped over the chair,\" and its negation is \"it's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair.\" \n\nThe negation of the statement does not necessarily mean the opposite is true. It simply means that the original statement is not a requirement. So, just because it's not required for the jacket to be draped over the chair, it doesn't necessarily mean that the jacket might not be draped over the chair. There could be other reasons or possibilities for the jacket to still be draped over the chair. \n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that the jacket might not be draped over the chair based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
