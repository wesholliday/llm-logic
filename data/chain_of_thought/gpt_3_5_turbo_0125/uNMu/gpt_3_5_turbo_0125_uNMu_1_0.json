The original statement \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" does not definitively state whether Mary was at the wedding or not. It simply negates the necessity of her presence. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that Mary might not have been at the wedding based solely on this statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
