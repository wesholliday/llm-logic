The premise states: \"If the car is in the garage, then it is safe.\" This can be represented as: A -> B (If A, then B).\n\nThe conclusion states: \"If the car is in the garage and the garage is flooding, then it is safe.\" This can be represented as: (A and C) -> B (If A and C, then B).\n\nTo check the validity of the argument, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In this case, the conclusion is not a direct result of the premise. The premise only talks about the car being safe when it is in the garage, but it does not mention anything about the garage flooding.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion goes beyond what is stated in the premise. \n\nAnswer: no",
