Conclusion: \"If I exercise and eat junk food, I will lose weight.\"\n\nThe conclusion \"If I exercise and eat junk food, I will lose weight\" is an extension of the premise \"If I exercise, I will lose weight.\" This argument is valid if the premise logically leads to the conclusion. \n\nIn this case, the argument is logically valid because if exercising alone leads to weight loss (as stated in the premise), then it follows that exercising and eating junk food would also lead to weight loss. This is because the conclusion builds upon the premise by adding an additional factor (eating junk food) without contradicting the initial premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
