The original premise is \"If I finish my homework, I can play video games.\" The conclusion is \"If I finish my homework and my computer catches on fire, I can play video games.\"\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. In this case, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise. The original premise only talks about finishing homework and playing video games, but the conclusion adds a new condition (computer catching on fire) that was not mentioned in the premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion goes beyond what was stated in the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
