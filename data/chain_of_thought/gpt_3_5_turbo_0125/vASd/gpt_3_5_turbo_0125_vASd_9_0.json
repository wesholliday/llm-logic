The premise states: \"If the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A.\" This can be represented as: A -> B (If A, then B).\n\nThe conclusion states: \"If the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A.\" This can be represented as: (A and C) -> B (If A and C, then B).\n\nThe argument is essentially saying that if the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A. This can be broken down into two separate statements: \n1. If the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A.\n2. If the essay is turned in late, then the student will get an A.\n\nSince the conclusion is based on the conjunction of the premise and an additional condition (turned in late), the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
