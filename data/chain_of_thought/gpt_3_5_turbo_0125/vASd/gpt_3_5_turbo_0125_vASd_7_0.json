The premise states \"If the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm,\" which can be represented as: \n\\(P \\rightarrow Q\\)\n\nThe conclusion states \"If the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm,\" which can be represented as: \n\\(P \\land R \\rightarrow Q\\)\n\nTo check the validity of the argument, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In this case, the conclusion is not a logical consequence of the premise because the addition of the condition \"the pilot light is out\" (R) in the conclusion changes the structure of the argument. The original premise does not provide any information about the pilot light being out affecting the warmth of the kitchen.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: no",
