The premise states \"If we go to the concert, then we'll have a good time,\" which can be represented as P -> Q (If P, then Q). The conclusion states \"If we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time,\" which can be represented as (P and R) -> Q (If P and R, then Q).\n\nIn this case, the argument is not logically valid. The original premise only establishes a relationship between going to the concert and having a good time, but it does not mention anything about a bomb going off. Therefore, the conclusion that includes the bomb going off introduces new information that was not part of the original premise. This makes the argument invalid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
