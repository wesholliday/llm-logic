The conclusion adds an additional condition, stating that if the test is in Chinese, studying hard will still result in passing the test. This conclusion is a specific case of the premise, as it includes the original condition of studying hard and adds the new condition of the test being in Chinese.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows from the premise. The conclusion is a valid deduction based on the given premise.",
