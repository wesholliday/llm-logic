The premise states \"If the match is struck, then it will light,\" which can be represented as P -> Q. The conclusion states \"If the match is struck and it has been soaked in water, then it will light,\" which can be represented as (P and R) -> Q. \n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In this case, the conclusion is not a direct consequence of the premise. The premise only talks about the match being struck leading to it lighting, but it does not mention anything about the match being soaked in water. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
