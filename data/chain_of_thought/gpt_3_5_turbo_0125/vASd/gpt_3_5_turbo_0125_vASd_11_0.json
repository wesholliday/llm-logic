The conclusion adds another condition, which is doing hard labor. The conclusion states that if you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired.\n\nGiven that the premise already establishes that getting enough sleep prevents tiredness, adding the condition of doing hard labor does not change the logical validity of the argument. This is because the conclusion is essentially saying the same thing as the premise, just with an additional condition.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
