If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n2. The unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nFrom the first statement, if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was also in the forest. However, the second statement tells us that the unicorn was not in the forest. This means that the initial condition (griffin in the forest) cannot be true because it would lead to a contradiction with the second statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
