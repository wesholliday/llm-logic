The wolf was not in the den.\n\nFrom the first statement, if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. However, the second statement tells us that the wolf was not in the den. This means that the initial condition for the first statement (bear in the cave) did not occur.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes",
