The mummy was not awake.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. Since the mummy was not awake, it means the vampire could not have been awake either. This is because if the vampire was awake, the mummy would have been awake according to the first statement, which contradicts the fact that the mummy was not awake.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
