If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n2. Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nFrom the first statement, if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. However, the second statement tells us that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This means the initial condition of Lisa buying the red shirt did not occur, so we cannot conclude whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
