The book is not a mystery novel.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. Since the book is not a mystery novel (as stated in the second statement), it means that the condition \"the book is a mystery novel\" in the first statement is false.\n\nIf the condition in the first statement is false (the book is not a mystery novel), then the statement \"the book was written by James\" can be either true or false. The first statement does not provide any information about what happens if the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively infer that the book was not written by James.",
