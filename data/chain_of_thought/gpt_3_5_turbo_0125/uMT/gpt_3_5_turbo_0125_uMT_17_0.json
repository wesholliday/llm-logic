Kate did not eat salad.\n\nFrom the first statement, if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. Since we know Kate did not eat salad, it means Ben did not eat pasta. This is because the first statement implies a conditional relationship - if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. Since Kate did not eat salad, it means the condition (Ben eating pasta) was not met.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
