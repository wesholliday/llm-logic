If Joe went to the park (as per the first statement), then Lucy would have gone to the zoo (according to the given implication).\n2. Since Lucy did not go to the zoo (as explicitly stated), it contradicts the implication. This means the initial hypothesis that Joe went to the park is false.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and logical reasoning, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
