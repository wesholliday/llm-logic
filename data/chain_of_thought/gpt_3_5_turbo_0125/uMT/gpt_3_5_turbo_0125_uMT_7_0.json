(~Chris)\n\nFrom statement 1, if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. Since Chris did not finish the race, we can conclude that Alex did not finish the race. This is because if Alex had finished the race, then Chris would have finished the race according to the first statement. Since Chris did not finish the race, it implies that Alex did not finish the race either.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
