Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nFrom the first statement, if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. However, the second statement tells us that Lucy did not go to the zoo. This means the first statement cannot be true, as it contradicts the second statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that Joe did not go to the park because the initial condition (Joe going to the park) was never met.\n\nAnswer: no",
