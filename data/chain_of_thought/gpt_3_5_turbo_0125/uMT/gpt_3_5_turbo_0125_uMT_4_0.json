The robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. However, we are also told that the robot did not visit Jupiter. This means that the first statement is false, as the robot did not visit Jupiter despite the alien visiting Mars.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that the alien did not visit Mars based on the given information. The alien could have visited Mars, but the robot did not visit Jupiter as expected.\n\nAnswer: no",
