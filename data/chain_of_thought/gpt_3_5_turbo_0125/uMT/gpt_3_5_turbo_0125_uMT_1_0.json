Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nFrom the first statement, if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. However, the second statement tells us that Sue was not at the wedding. This means that Mary cannot be at the wedding because if she were, Sue would have to be there according to the first statement. Since Sue was not at the wedding, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
