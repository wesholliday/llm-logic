Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nFrom statement 1, if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. Since Mark did not buy the blue shirt, we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This is because the initial statement establishes a logical relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. If the premise of Lisa buying the red shirt does not hold true, then we cannot infer anything about Mark's purchase based on that condition.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
