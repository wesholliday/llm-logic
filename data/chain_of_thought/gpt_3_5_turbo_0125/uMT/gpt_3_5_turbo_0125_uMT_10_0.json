The cat was not outside.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. Since the cat was not outside (from statement 2), it implies that the dog was not inside. This is because if the dog were inside, the cat would have been outside according to the first statement, which contradicts the fact that the cat was not outside.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
