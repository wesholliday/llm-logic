The truck was not blue.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. Since the truck was not blue (from the second statement), it means that the car cannot be red. This is because if the car were red, then the truck would have been blue according to the first statement, which contradicts the given information that the truck was not blue.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
