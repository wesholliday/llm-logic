Amy did not play tennis.\n\nFrom the first statement, if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. Since we know Amy did not play tennis (from the second statement), it means Jeff did not play basketball. This is because the first statement implies that if Jeff played basketball, Amy must have played tennis. Since Amy did not play tennis, Jeff could not have played basketball.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
