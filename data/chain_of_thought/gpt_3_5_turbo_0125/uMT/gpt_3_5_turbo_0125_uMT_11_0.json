The muffins were not blueberry.\n\nFrom statement 1, if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. Since the muffins were not blueberry (statement 2), it means that the cake cannot be chocolate based on the first statement. This is because if the cake were chocolate, the muffins would have to be blueberry according to the first statement, which contradicts the fact that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
