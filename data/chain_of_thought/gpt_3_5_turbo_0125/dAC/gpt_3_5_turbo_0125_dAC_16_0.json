            "content": "To determine if we can deduce that the shirt was cotton, we need to consider the given statements logically. \n\n1. \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" - This statement implies a conditional relationship. If the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim.\n\n2. \"The pants were denim\" - This statement directly tells us that the pants were denim.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can deduce the following:\n- If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n- The pants were denim.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the pants were denim. Since the first statement establishes a conditional relationship between the shirt being cotton and the pants being denim, and we know the pants were denim, we can conclude that the shirt must have been cotton. \n\nTherefore, we can deduce that \"The shirt was cotton.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
