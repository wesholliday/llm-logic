The first statement is a conditional statement, which states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. The second statement is a simple statement that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude that Joe went to the park. The first statement only tells us what happens if Joe went to the park, but it does not tell us whether Joe actually went to the park. The second statement tells us that Lucy went to the zoo, but it does not provide any information about Joe's whereabouts.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot deduce that Joe went to the park.\n\nAnswer: no",
