The second statement is simply B. From these two statements alone, we cannot definitively conclude that A is true. This is because the first statement only tells us what happens if A is true, but it does not tell us anything about what happens if A is false. Therefore, we cannot deduce that Mary was at the wedding based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
