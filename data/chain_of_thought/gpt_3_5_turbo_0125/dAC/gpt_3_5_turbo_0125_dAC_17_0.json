The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" The second statement is a simple statement: \"Kate ate salad.\"\n\nGiven that the first statement is a conditional statement, we know that if the antecedent (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the consequent (Kate ate salad) must also be true. However, the truth of the consequent alone does not necessarily mean that the antecedent is true. In this case, we are given that Kate ate salad, but we do not have any information about whether Ben ate pasta or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot deduce that Ben ate pasta.\n\nAnswer: no",
