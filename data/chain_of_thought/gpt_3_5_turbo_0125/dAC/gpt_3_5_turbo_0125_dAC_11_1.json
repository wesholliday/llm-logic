To determine this, we take the contrapositive of the original conditional statement: not Blueberry \u2192 not Cake. Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, if not Blueberry is false (since we know that the muffins were blueberry), then not Cake (cake not being chocolate) must be false as well.
