However, this does not necessarily mean that Sue chose pizza. The first statement only tells us what happens if Sue chooses pizza, but it does not provide any information about what happens if Sue does not choose pizza.\n\nTherefore, we cannot deduce that Sue chose pizza based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
