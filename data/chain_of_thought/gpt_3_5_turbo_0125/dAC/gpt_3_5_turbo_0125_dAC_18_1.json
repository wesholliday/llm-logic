Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. From the first statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This statement implies a conditional relationship, where if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. It does not give us direct information about the doll's material if the truck is not metal.\n\n2. The second statement states that \"The truck was metal.\" This provides direct information about the truck's material.\n\nCombining these two statements, we know that:\n- If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n- The truck was indeed metal.\n\nGiven this information, we can conclude that the doll being plastic is only a condition for the truck to be metal. It does not mean that if the truck is metal, the doll must be plastic. The doll's material could still be something other than plastic.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot deduce that \"The doll was plastic.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
