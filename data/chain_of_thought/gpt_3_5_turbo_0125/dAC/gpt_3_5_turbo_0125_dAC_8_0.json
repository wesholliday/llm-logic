The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" Therefore, the contrapositive of \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\"\n\nGiven that the mummy was awake, we can conclude that the contrapositive statement tells us the vampire was awake as well. Therefore, we can deduce that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
