The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" The second statement is a simple statement: \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nGiven these statements, we know that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. We also know that Amy played tennis. However, we cannot definitively conclude that Jeff played basketball based on the information provided. This is because the conditional statement only tells us what happens if Jeff played basketball, but it does not tell us anything about what happens if Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nTherefore, we cannot deduce that Jeff played basketball based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
