The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" Therefore, the contrapositive of \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" Since we know that Mark bought the blue shirt, we can conclude that Lisa did buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
