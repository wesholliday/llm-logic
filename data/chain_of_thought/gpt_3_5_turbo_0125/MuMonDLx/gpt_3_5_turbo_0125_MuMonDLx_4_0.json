In this case, the original statement is \"The plonk must quazzle at grazzle plimp.\" The second statement is \"The plonk must quazzle at grazzle plimp or be frazzle.\" Since the original statement is part of the second statement, the second statement must be true if the original statement is true. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
