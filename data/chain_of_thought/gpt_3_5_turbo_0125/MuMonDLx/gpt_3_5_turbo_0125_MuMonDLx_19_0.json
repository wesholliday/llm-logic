In this case, the original statement is \"The quibble must be froodle quank\", which we can represent as A. The statement we are trying to infer is \"The quibble must be froodle quank or frazzle fribble\", which we can represent as A or B. Since A is true in the original statement, the statement \"A or B\" is also true regardless of the truth value of B. Therefore, we can infer \"The quibble must be froodle quank or frazzle fribble\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
