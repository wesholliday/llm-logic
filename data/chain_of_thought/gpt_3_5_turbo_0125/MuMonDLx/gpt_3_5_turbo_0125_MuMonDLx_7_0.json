In this case, the original statement is \"The gronk must be flibbit.\" If we add \"or gribble\" to this statement, it does not change the truth value of the original statement. This is because the original statement is already true, so adding another option does not affect the truth of the statement. Therefore, we can infer \"The gronk must be flibbit or gribble.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
