In this case, the original statement is \"The plonk must be quork frozz\", which means A is true. When we add \"or fizzle\" to the statement, it does not change the truth value of the original statement. Therefore, the statement \"The plonk must be quork frozz or fizzle\" is true because the original statement is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
