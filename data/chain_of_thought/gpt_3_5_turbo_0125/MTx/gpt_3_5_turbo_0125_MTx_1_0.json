The contrapositive of \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A.\" \n\nGiven:\n1. If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled. (If blimmed, then zargled)\n2. The flugel was not zargled. (Not zargled)\n\nContrapositive of statement 1:\n- If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed. (If not zargled, then not blimmed)\n\nSince statement 2 tells us that the flugel was not zargled, according to the contrapositive of statement 1, we can infer that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'yes'.
