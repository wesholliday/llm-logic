The contrapositive of \"If A then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nGiven:\n1. If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint. (If A then B)\n2. The smip did not lup the zoint. (Not B)\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer the contrapositive:\n- If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped. (If not B then not A)\n\nSince statement 2 is \"The smip did not lup the zoint\" (Not B), we can conclude from the contrapositive that \"The smip was not shripped\" (Not A).\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The smip was not shripped' from the given statements. \n\nAnswer: yes",
