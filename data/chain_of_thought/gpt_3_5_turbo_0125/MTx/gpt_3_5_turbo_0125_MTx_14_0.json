(not B)\n\nContrapositive of statement 1:\n1'. If the clug did not snug, then the clug was not fleeked. (If not B then not A)\n\nNow, combining statement 1' with statement 2:\n1'. If the clug did not snug, then the clug was not fleeked.\n2. The clug did not snugged.\n\nFrom the above, we can infer that \"The clug was not fleeked\" because if the clug did not snug (not B), then the clug was not fleeked (not A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
