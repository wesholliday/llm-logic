The contrapositive of \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A.\" \n\nGiven:\n1. If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\n2. The zinger was not smoogled.\n\nContrapositive of the first statement:\n1'. If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nNow, combining statement 1' with statement 2, we can infer:\n- The zinger was not fraggled.\n\nTherefore, based on the contrapositive reasoning, we can infer that 'The zinger was not fraggled' from the given statements. \n\nAnswer: yes",
