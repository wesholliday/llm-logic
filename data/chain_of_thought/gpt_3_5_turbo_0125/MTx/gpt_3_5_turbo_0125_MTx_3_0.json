However, we cannot definitively conclude that the splat was not morphed based on this information alone. The first statement only tells us what happens if the splat was morphed, but it does not provide information about what happens if the splat was not morphed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The splat was not morphed' from the given statements.",
