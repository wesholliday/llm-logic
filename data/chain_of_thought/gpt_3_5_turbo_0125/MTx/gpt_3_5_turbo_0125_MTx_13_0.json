(Not B)\n\nContrapositive of statement 1:\n1'. If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged. (If not B then not A)\n\nNow, combining statement 1' with statement 2, we can infer:\n- The glip was not tragged (Not B)\n- Therefore, the glip was not slogged (Not A)\n\nSo, yes, we can infer that the glip was not slogged from the given statements.",
