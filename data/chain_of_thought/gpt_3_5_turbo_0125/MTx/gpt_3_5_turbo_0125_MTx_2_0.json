The contrapositive of \"If A then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" \n\nGiven:\n1. If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint. (If A then B)\n2. The wug did not bim the zoint. (Not B)\n\nContrapositive of statement 1:\n- If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped. (If not B then not A)\n\nTherefore, from the contrapositive, we can infer that if the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped. So, the statement 'The wug was not flooped' can be inferred from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
