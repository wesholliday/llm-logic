The sneg did not sproted the frink.\n\nContrapositive of the first statement:\n1'. If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\n\nNow, combining statement 1' with statement 2, we can infer:\n3. The sneg was not crampled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and the contrapositive reasoning, we can infer that \"The sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
