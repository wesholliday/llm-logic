It states that if the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\n\n2. \"The smonk did not plagged\" - This statement tells us that the smonk did not plagged.\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications:\n\n- If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\n- But we know that the smonk did not plagged.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot definitively infer that the smonk was not vreebled. The absence of the smonk plagged does not necessarily mean that the smonk was not vreebled. It is possible that the smonk was vreebled but did not plagged for some other reason.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The smonk was not vreebled' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
