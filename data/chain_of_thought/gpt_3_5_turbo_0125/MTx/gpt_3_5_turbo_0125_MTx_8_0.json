The contrapositive of the statement \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A.\"\n\nGiven:\n1. If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled. (A -> B)\n2. The sprocket was not daggled. (not B)\n\nFrom statement 1, we can write the contrapositive as:\n1'. If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was cranked. (B -> A)\n\nNow, combining statement 1' with statement 2 (not B), we can infer:\n3. The sprocket was not cranked. (not A)\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The sprocket was not cranked\" from the given statements.",
