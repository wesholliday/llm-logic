It states that if the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\n\n2. \"The grommet did not plop the frink\" - This statement tells us that the grommet did not plop the frink.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer the following:\n\n- If the grommet did not plop the frink, then it means the condition in the first statement (\"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\") was not met. This means that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The grommet was not sploffed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
