The contrapositive of \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A.\" So, the contrapositive of \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" is \"If the wug was not garpled, then it was not sproinged.\"\n\nGiven that \"The wug was not garpled,\" we can apply the contrapositive to conclude that \"The wug was not sproinged.\" This is a valid inference based on the contrapositive relationship between the statements.\n\nTherefore, the inference that \"The wug was not sproinged\" can be made from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
