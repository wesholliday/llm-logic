This can be represented as: Snurgled \u2192 Crinked.\n\n2. \"The fribble did not crink\" - This statement tells us that the fribble did not crink. This can be represented as: \u00acCrinked.\n\nNow, if we want to infer \"The fribble was not snurgled,\" we need to consider the contrapositive of the first statement:\n\n- The contrapositive of Snurgled \u2192 Crinked is \u00acCrinked \u2192 \u00acSnurgled.\n\nSince we know that the fribble did not crink (\u00acCrinked), according to the contrapositive, we can infer that the fribble was not snurgled (\u00acSnurgled).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and the contrapositive relationship, we can infer that \"The fribble was not snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
