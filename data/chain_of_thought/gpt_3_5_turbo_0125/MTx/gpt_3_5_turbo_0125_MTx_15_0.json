The contrapositive of \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A.\" \n\nGiven:\n1. If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened. (A -> B)\n2. The dreb was not spened. (not B)\n\nContrapositive of the first statement:\n1'. If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed. (not B -> not A)\n\nNow, combining statement 1' with statement 2, we can infer:\n- The dreb was not vroombed. (not A)\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The dreb was not vroombed\" from the given statements. \n\nAnswer: yes",
