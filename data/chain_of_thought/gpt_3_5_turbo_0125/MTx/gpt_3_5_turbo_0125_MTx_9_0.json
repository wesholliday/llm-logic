The contrapositive of \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A.\" \n\nGiven:\n1. If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\n2. The twonk was not varnished.\n\nContrapositive of the first statement:\n1'. If the twonk was not varnished, then it was not plinked.\n\nSince statement 2 states that the twonk was not varnished, according to the contrapositive of the first statement, we can infer that the twonk was not plinked.\n\nTherefore, the inference \"The twonk was not plinked\" can be made from the given statements. \n\nAnswer: yes",
