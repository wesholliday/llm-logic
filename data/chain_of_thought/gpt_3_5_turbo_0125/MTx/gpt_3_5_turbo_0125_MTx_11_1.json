If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\n2. The flug was not zimmed.\n\nWe are asked whether we can infer:\n3. The flug was not blummed.\n\nLet's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed\": This statement establishes a conditional relationship between being blummed and being zimmed. In logical terms, this can be represented as \"blummed \u2192 zimmed\".\n\n2. \"The flug was not zimmed\": This indicates that the flug was not zimmed, which in logical terms can be represented as \"~zimmed\".\n\nGiven these premises, we can assess whether we can logically infer that the flug was not blummed based on the information provided.\n\nOne way to approach this is to consider the contrapositive of the first statement. The contrapositive of \"blummed \u2192 zimmed\" is \"~zimmed \u2192 ~blummed.\" If we combine this contrapositive with the second given premise that \"The flug was not zimmed\" or \"~zimmed\", we get \"~zimmed \u2192 ~blummed\". This indicates that if the flug was not zimmed, then it was not blummed.\n\nTherefore, based on the premises and the logic presented, we can infer that \"The flug was not blummed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
