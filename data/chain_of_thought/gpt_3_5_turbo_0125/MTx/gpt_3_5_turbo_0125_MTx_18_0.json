However, we are given that the shank was not nugged (\u00acN). \n\nGiven the information provided, we cannot definitively infer that the shank was not plooked. It is possible that the shank was plooked but not nugged, as the absence of being nugged does not necessarily mean the absence of being plooked.\n\nAnswer: no",
