However, from the given statements alone, we cannot definitively conclude that the sprocket is cranked. This is because the absence of the sprocket being daggled (\u00acD) does not necessarily mean that it must be cranked (C). It could be the case that the sprocket is neither daggled nor cranked based on the information provided.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The sprocket is cranked\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
