By applying the distributive law, we can simplify this to (~S \u2227 S) \u2228 (~S \u2227 V). Since the conjunction ~S \u2227 S is a contradiction (it cannot be true that the dreb must not be spened and it must be spened at the same time), we are left with ~S \u2227 V.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The dreb is vroombed\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
