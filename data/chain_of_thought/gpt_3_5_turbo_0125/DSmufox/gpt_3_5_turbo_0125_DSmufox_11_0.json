Either the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed: (Flug must be zimmed) \u2228 (Flug is blummed)\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that it is not necessary for the flug to be zimmed. This means that the flug can be either zimmed or not zimmed.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that either the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed. Since we have already established that it is not necessary for the flug to be zimmed, the only remaining option is that the flug is blummed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
