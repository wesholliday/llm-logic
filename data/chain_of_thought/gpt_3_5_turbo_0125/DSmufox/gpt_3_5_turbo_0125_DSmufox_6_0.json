From the second statement, we know that either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed. Since it's not the case that the grommet must be plopped (~P), the only remaining possibility is that the grommet is sploffed (S).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The grommet is sploffed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
