It says that the scarf must be in one of two places: draped on the coat rack or stuffed in the backpack. Since the first statement rules out the possibility of the scarf being draped on the coat rack, the only remaining possibility is for the scarf to be stuffed in the backpack.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
