Therefore, the missing sock must be somewhere other than under the bed.\n\nStatement 2 introduces a logical relationship between the locations of the missing sock. It states that the missing sock is either under the bed or in the laundry basket. Since we know from statement 1 that the missing sock is not under the bed, it must be in the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The missing sock is in the laundry basket.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
