This is because the second statement says the toy is either on the shelf or in the toy box, and we know that it is not on the shelf. Therefore, the only remaining option is for the toy to be in the toy box.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The toy is in the toy box.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
