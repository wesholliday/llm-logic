The first statement is: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\"\n\nGiven these two statements, we can analyze them together:\n\n- If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\n- It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that Amy did not play tennis. Therefore, we can conclude that Jeff did not play basketball because the first statement implies that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. Since Amy did not play tennis, Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
