If the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry\" - This statement negates the idea that the muffins must have been blueberry. This means that the muffins were not necessarily blueberry.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer the following:\n\n- If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n- It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude that the cake was not chocolate. The second statement only tells us that the muffins were not necessarily blueberry, but it does not provide direct information about the cake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The cake was not chocolate\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
