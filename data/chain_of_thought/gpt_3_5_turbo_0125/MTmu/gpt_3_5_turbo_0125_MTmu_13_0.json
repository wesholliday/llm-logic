The first statement is: \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. This is a conditional statement.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that it is not the case that the truck must have been blue. This means the truck was not blue.\n\nCombining the two statements, we can conclude that the car was not red because if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue, but we know the truck was not blue.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The car was not red'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
