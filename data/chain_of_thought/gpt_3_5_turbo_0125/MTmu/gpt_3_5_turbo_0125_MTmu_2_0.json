If the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn must also be in the forest.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest\" - This statement negates the idea that the unicorn must be in the forest.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that if the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was also not in the forest. This is because the first statement establishes a connection between the griffin and the unicorn being in the forest, and the second statement denies the unicorn's presence in the forest.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The griffin was not in the forest'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
