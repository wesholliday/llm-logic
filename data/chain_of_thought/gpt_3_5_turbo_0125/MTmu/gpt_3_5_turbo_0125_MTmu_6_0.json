The statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\" can be represented as: Sue (pizza) \u2192 Bob (pasta).\n2. The statement \"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta\" can be represented as: \u00ac(Bob (pasta)).\n\nNow, if we combine these two statements, we get:\n\u00ac(Bob (pasta)) \u2192 \u00acSue (pizza).\n\nThis means that if Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza. However, this does not necessarily mean that Sue did not choose pizza. It only tells us that if Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that Sue did not choose pizza from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
