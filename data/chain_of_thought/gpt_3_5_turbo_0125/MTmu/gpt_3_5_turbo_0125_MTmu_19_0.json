The first statement is: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\"\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that if Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football. This is because the first statement implies that if Tom watched football, Jen must have watched basketball. Since the second statement tells us that Jen did not watch basketball, it follows that Tom did not watch football.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that 'Tom did not watch football.'\n\nAnswer: yes",
