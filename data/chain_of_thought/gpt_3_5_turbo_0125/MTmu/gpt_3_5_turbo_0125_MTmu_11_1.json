Therefore, whether the muffins must be blueberry (Q) or not doesn't change anything when the cake is not chocolate, as the conditional is satisfied.\n\n- When it's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry, the original implication 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry' is not violated because the muffins do not have to be blueberry.\n\nBased on the given statements and the logic behind them, we can infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
