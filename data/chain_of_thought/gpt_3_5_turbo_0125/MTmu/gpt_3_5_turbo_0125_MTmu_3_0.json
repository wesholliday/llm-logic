The contrapositive of A \u2192 B is \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA. Therefore, if it's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel (\u00acB), then we can infer that the book was not written by James (\u00acA).\n\nSo, based on the logical relationship between the statements provided, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
