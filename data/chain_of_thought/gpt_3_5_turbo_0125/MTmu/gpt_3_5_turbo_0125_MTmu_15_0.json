The first statement is: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer the contrapositive: \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\"\n\nGiven the second statement, which states that Erin did not necessarily take a train, we can conclude that Sam did not necessarily take a plane. However, we cannot definitively say that Sam did not take a plane, as there could be other possibilities.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that 'Sam did not take a plane' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
