The first statement given is \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: Car (red) \u2192 Truck (blue).\n\n2. The second statement given is \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\" This statement can be represented as \u00ac(Truck must be blue) or \u00ac(Truck (blue)).\n\n3. To infer \"The car was not red\", we need to consider the contrapositive of the first statement. The contrapositive of A \u2192 B is \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA. Therefore, the contrapositive of Car (red) \u2192 Truck (blue) is \u00acTruck (blue) \u2192 \u00acCar (red).\n\n4. Combining the second statement with the contrapositive of the first statement, we have: \u00ac(Truck (blue)) \u2227 \u00acCar (red). This can be simplified to \u00acTruck (blue) \u2227 \u00acCar (red).\n\n5. From the statement \u00ac(Truck must be blue) and the contrapositive of the first statement, we can infer that the truck was not blue, but we cannot definitively infer the color of the car.
