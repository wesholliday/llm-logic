The first statement is: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This is because if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. However, the second statement tells us that Mark did not necessarily buy the blue shirt. Therefore, we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
