The first statement is: 'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.'\n2. The second statement is: 'It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.'\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer the following:\n- If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\n- It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the banana was not yellow. Therefore, we can conclude that the antecedent of the first statement (the apple being red) did not occur. So, we can infer that 'The apple was not red.'\n\nAnswer: yes",
