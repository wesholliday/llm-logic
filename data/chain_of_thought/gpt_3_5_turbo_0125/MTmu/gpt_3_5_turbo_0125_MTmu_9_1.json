From the first statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt,\" we can infer:\n   - If Lisa did buy the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n   - This statement does not definitively state whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not, but it links Mark's purchase to Lisa's purchase.\n\n2. Second statement: \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt\":\n   - This statement negates the implication that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\n3. To infer \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\":\n   - The given statements do not directly provide information about Lisa's purchase independent of Mark's purchase.\n   - Since the second statement negates Mark buying the blue shirt, it does not directly provide information about Lisa's purchase.\n   - Without direct information about Lisa's purchase, we cannot definitively infer whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not from the given statements.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the conclusion 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt' cannot be inferred from the given statements. \n\nAnswer: no",

This means if Lisa bought the red shirt, Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\n2. The statement \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" indicates that we cannot be certain that Mark bought the blue shirt.

The lack of certainty about Mark buying the blue shirt does not allow us to conclusively determine Lisa's purchase.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" from the given statements. \n\nAnswer: no",
