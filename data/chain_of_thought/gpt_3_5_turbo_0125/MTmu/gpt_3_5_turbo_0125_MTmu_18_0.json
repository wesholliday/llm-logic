This means that if the doll was not plastic, we cannot make any conclusions about the truck.\n\nThe second statement tells us that it is not the case that the truck must have been metal. This means that the truck could have been either metal or not metal.\n\nCombining the two statements, we can conclude that we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic. The information provided does not allow us to make a definitive conclusion about the material of the doll.\n\nAnswer: no",
