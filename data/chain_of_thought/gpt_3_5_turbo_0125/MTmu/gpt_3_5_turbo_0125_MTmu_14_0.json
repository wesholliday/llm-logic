Let's analyze:\n\n- From the first statement, if Bear in cave -> Wolf in den, and we know \u00ac(Wolf in den), we cannot definitively conclude \u00ac(Bear in cave) because the absence of the wolf in the den does not necessarily mean the bear was not in the cave. The bear could still be in the cave or not in the cave, as the statement only provides a condition for the wolf being in the den if the bear is in the cave.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The bear was not in the cave' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
