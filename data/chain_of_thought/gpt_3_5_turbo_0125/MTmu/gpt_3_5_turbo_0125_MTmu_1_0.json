This is a conditional statement.\n\nFrom the second statement, we are given the negation of the consequent of the conditional statement in the first statement. In other words, it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot directly infer that Mary was not at the wedding. The absence of Sue being required at the wedding does not necessarily mean Mary was not at the wedding. There could be other reasons why Sue was not required to be at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
