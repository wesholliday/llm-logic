The first statement is: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten the salad.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad.\"\n\nGiven these statements:\n- If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten the salad.

This means that Kate not eating the salad is a possibility.\n\nFrom the given statements, we can infer the following:\n- If Kate did not eat the salad, we cannot conclude anything about whether Ben ate pasta or not because we are not given any information about what happens if Kate does not eat the salad.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: no",
