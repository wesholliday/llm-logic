The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\"\n2. The second statement negates the consequent of the conditional statement: \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\"\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot directly infer that Joe did not go to the park. The first statement only establishes a relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo. The second statement negates the requirement for Lucy to go to the zoo, but it does not provide any information about Joe going to the park.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Joe did not go to the park based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
