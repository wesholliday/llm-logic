Therefore, we can conclude that the dog was not inside because if the dog was inside, the cat would have been outside according to the first statement. Since the cat was not outside, the dog cannot be inside.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The dog was not inside' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
