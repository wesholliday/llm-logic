This means the implication is such that if Jeff played basketball (P), then Amy played tennis (Q) must be true.\n\nThe negation of the second statement is: \"Amy must have played tennis,\" which means it is not the case that Amy did not play tennis.\n\nTherefore, put together, we have:\n\n1.

But since it is not the case that Amy played tennis, it means Jeff did not play basketball. This is because the first statement tells us that if Jeff played basketball, Amy must have played tennis. In logic, if the consequent of a conditional statement is false, then the only way to satisfy the statement is if the antecedent is false as well. Therefore, if Amy did not play tennis, it follows that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
