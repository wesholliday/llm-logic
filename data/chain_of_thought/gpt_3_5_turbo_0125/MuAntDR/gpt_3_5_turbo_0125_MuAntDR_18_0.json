The original statement allows for two possibilities: the medicine was taken with food or on an empty stomach. It does not definitively state that the medicine was taken on an empty stomach. It is possible that the medicine was taken with food. Therefore, we cannot infer that the medicine must have been taken on an empty stomach.\n\nAnswer: no",
