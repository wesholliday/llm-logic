However, just because the concert must have been sold out or postponed does not necessarily mean that it must have been postponed. It is possible that the concert was sold out and still happened as scheduled. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the concert must have been postponed based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
