'It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf': This implies that the toy is not required to be on the bookshelf. So, it could be somewhere else.\n\n2. 'Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf': This statement tells us that the toy is either in the toy box or on the bookshelf.
