This means the cookies could be somewhere else.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the cookies are either in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry. Since it is not necessary for the cookies to be hidden in the pantry (as per the first statement), the cookies must be in the jar.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
