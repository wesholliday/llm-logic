Since we know from the first statement that the sunglasses are not necessarily on her head, we can simplify the above sentence to (sunglasses are in her bag) \u2228 \u00ac(sunglasses are in her bag).\n\nNow, since one of the options is that the sunglasses are in her bag, from the disjunction (sunglasses are in her bag) \u2228 \u00ac(sunglasses are in her bag) we can conclude that the sunglasses are indeed in her bag.\n\nTherefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
