This means the cat could be doing something else.\n\nFrom the second statement, we have two possibilities: the cat is napping on the couch or playing in the bedroom. Since it is not necessary for the cat to be playing in the bedroom, the cat could indeed be napping on the couch.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that 'The cat is napping on the couch'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
