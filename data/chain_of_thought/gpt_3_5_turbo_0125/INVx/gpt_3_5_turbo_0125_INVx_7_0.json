The first statement is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If P, then Q.\" The second statement is the contrapositive of the first statement, which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" In this case, P represents \"the whiffle was shanked\" and Q represents \"the whiffle tinked.\"\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\" is \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked.\"\n\nSo, yes, we can infer \"If the whiffle was not shanked, then the whiffle did not tink\" from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: yes",
