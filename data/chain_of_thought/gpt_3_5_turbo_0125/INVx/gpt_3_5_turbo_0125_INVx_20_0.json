            "content": "To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"the fleeg was bluttered\" and Q is \"it surned.\" \n\nThe second statement is the contrapositive of the first statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" In this case, \"If the fleeg did not surn, then it was not bluttered.\"\n\nTo determine if the second statement can be inferred from the first, we need to check if the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. In this case, the contrapositive is not equivalent to the original statement because the original statement does not specify what happens if the fleeg was not bluttered. It only tells us what happens if the fleeg was bluttered.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first statement. \n\nAnswer: no",
