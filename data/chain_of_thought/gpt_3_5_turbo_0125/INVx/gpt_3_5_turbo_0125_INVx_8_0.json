            "content": "To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. The original statement is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If P, then Q.\" The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nGiven the original statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled,\" we can rewrite it as \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\" by taking the contrapositive.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the sprocket was not cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
