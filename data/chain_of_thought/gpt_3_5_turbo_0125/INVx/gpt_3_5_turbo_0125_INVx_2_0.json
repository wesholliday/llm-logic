            "content": "To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to consider the logical form of the original statement. The original statement is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If P, then Q.\" The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nIn this case, the original statement is \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\" Let's represent this as \"If F, then B.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If not B, then not F.\" This translates to \"If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer the statement \"If the wug was not flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint\" from the original statement \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
