            "content": "To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to consider the logical form of the original statement. The original statement is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If P, then Q.\" The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" \n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed\" is \"If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed.\" \n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the flug was not blummed, then the flug was not zimmed\" from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: yes",
