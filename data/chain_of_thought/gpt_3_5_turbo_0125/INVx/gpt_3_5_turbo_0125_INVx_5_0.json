The original statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\" can be represented as: \n\nIf P, then Q. \n\nTo infer the second statement \"If the zinger was not fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled\", we would need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". \n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of the original statement would be: \n\nIf the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled. \n\nThis is not the same as the second statement we are trying to infer. \n\nSo, based on the logical relationship between the original statement and the second statement, we cannot directly infer the second statement from the first. \n\nAnswer: no",
