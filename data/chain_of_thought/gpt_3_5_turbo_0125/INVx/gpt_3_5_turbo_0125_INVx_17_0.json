The original statement is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If A, then B.\" The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated\" is \"If the flob was not movated, then the flob was not skizzled.\" This is not the same as the statement \"If the flob was not skizzled, then the flob was not movated.\"\n\nTherefore, we cannot directly infer the second statement from the first without additional information or assumptions.",
