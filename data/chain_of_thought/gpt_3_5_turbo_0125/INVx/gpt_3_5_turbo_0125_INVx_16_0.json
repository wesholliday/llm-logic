            "content": "To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. The original statement is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If P, then Q.\" The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nGiven the original statement: \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink,\" we can rewrite it as \"If sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was crampled.\"\n\nNow, to find the contrapositive of the original statement: \"If the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink,\" we can rewrite it as \"If sneg did not sprot the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nComparing the contrapositive of the original statement with the second statement, we see that they are not the same. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
