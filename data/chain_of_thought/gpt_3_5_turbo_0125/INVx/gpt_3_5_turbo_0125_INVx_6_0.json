            "content": "To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. The first statement is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If A, then B.\" The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of the first statement \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" would be \"If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\"\n\nTherefore, the second statement \"If the grommet was not sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink\" is not the contrapositive of the first statement. To infer the second statement from the first, we would need to know that the grommet plopped the frink if and only if it was sploffed, which is not explicitly stated in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
