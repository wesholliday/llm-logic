The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of the original statement is: \nIf not Q, then not P.\n\nComparing the contrapositive to the statement we want to infer, we see that they are not the same. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk was not plagged\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
