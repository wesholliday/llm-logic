The original statement is in the form \"If P, then Q\" where P represents \"the clug was fleeked\" and Q represents \"the clug snugged.\"\n2. The contrapositive of the original statement is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n3. Therefore, the contrapositive of the original statement would be \"If the clug was not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked.\"\n\nBased on the contrapositive, we can infer that if the clug was not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked. This is because the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\" implies \"If the clug was not fleeked, then the clug was not snugged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
