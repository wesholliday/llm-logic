In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, if we can infer the contrapositive of the original statement, it means that the original statement is true.\n\nSo, to answer the question, we need to determine if the contrapositive of the original statement is valid based on the logical relationship between the two statements.",
