The original statement is in the form \"If P then Q\", where P represents \"the glip was slogged\" and Q represents \"the glip was tragged\". \n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement is \"If not Q then not P\". In this case, \"not Q\" means \"the glip was not tragged\" and \"not P\" means \"the glip was not slogged\". \n\nTherefore, if the contrapositive is true, then we can infer the second statement from the first. \n\nAnswer: yes",
