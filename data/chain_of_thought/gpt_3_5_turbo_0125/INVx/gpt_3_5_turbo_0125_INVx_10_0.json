            "content": "To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to consider the logical form of the original statement. The original statement is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If P, then Q.\" The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" Therefore, if we take the contrapositive of the original statement, we get \"If the wug was not garpled, then it was not sproinged.\" \n\nSo, in this case, we can infer the statement \"If the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled\" from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: yes",
