The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q.\" The second statement is the contrapositive of the first statement, which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nIn this case:\n- Original statement: If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\n- Contrapositive: If the fribble did not crinkle, then the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the second statement from the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
