The original statement is in the form \"If P then Q\", where P represents \"the dreb was vroombed\" and Q represents \"the dreb was spened\". \n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement is \"If not Q then not P\". In this case, \"not Q\" represents \"the dreb was not spened\" and \"not P\" represents \"the dreb was not vroombed\".\n\nTherefore, if the contrapositive is true, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
