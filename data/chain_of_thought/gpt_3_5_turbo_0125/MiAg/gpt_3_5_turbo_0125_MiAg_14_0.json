This means that the pizza could be either mushroom or pepperoni, or even both. However, it does not explicitly state that the pizza is definitely both mushroom and pepperoni at the same time. Therefore, we cannot infer that the pizza is both mushroom and pepperoni based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
