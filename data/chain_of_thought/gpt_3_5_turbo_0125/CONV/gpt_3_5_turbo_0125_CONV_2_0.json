The original statement is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If A, then B.\" In this case, A is \"the griffin was in the forest\" and B is \"the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\nWhen we have a conditional statement like \"If A, then B,\" it does not necessarily mean that \"If B, then A\" is true. This is because the original statement only tells us about the relationship between A and B, not the relationship between B and A.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was in the forest\" from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: no",
