The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\" In this case, A is \"Sue chose pizza\" and B is \"Bob chose pasta.\" \n\nWhen we have a conditional statement like \"If A, then B,\" the contrapositive of that statement is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the contrapositive of the first statement would be \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n\nGiven this, we cannot directly infer the second statement \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza\" from the first statement. This is because the contrapositive of the first statement does not lead to the second statement. The contrapositive only tells us that if Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first statement.",
