The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\" In this case, A is \"Tom watched football\" and B is \"Jen watched basketball.\" \n\nWhen we have a conditional statement like \"If A, then B,\" the contrapositive of that statement is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the contrapositive of the first statement would be \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nTherefore, we cannot directly infer the second statement \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football\" from the first statement. The contrapositive of the first statement does not lead to the second statement. \n\nAnswer: no",
