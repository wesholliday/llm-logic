The original statement is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If A, then B.\" In this case, A is \"Alex finished the race\" and B is \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\nWhen we try to infer the second statement from the first, we are essentially switching the positions of A and B. This is known as the converse of the original statement. In logic, the converse of a conditional statement is not always true. \n\nIn this case, just because we know that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race, it does not necessarily mean that if Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race. There could be other factors at play that affect each person's ability to finish the race.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
