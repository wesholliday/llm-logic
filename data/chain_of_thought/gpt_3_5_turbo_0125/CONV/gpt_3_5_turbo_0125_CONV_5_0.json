In a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B\", the contrapositive is \"If not B, then not A\". \n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of the original statement 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis' is 'If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball'.\n\nGiven this, we cannot directly infer the statement 'If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball' from the original statement. The contrapositive statement does not lead to the desired conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
