            "content": "To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\" This means that if A is true, then B must also be true. \n\nGiven the statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" we can infer that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue also attended. However, we cannot automatically infer the reverse statement that if Sue attended, then Mary must have attended. This is because the original statement does not provide any information about whether Sue's presence at the wedding is dependent on Mary's presence. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\" from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: no",
