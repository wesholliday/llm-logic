The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\" This means that if the apple was red (A), then the banana was yellow (B).\n\nTo infer the second statement \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red,\" we would need to reverse the order of the original conditional statement. This is known as the converse of the original statement. In logic, the converse of a conditional statement is not always true. \n\nIn this case, just because the apple being red implies the banana is yellow does not necessarily mean that if the banana is yellow, the apple must be red. There could be other reasons why the banana is yellow that do not involve the apple being red. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first based solely on the information given.",
