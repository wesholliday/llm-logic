If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. (Premise)\n2. Jen might not have watched basketball. (Premise)\n\nFrom the first premise, if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. However, the second premise states that Jen might not have watched basketball. This means that it is possible that Jen did not watch basketball, which contradicts the first premise. \n\nTherefore, based on the premises given, the conclusion that 'Tom did not watch football' is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
