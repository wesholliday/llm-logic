(Premise)\n2. The truck might not have been metal. (Premise)\n\nFrom the first premise, we can infer that if the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not necessarily metal. This is because the first premise establishes a conditional relationship between the doll being plastic and the truck being metal. If the antecedent (doll being plastic) is false, the consequent (truck being metal) does not have to be true.\n\nGiven the second premise that the truck might not have been metal, it is possible that the doll was not plastic. This is because if the truck was not metal, it does not necessarily mean that the doll was plastic according to the first premise.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that the doll was not plastic can be logically inferred from the premises provided. \n\nAnswer: yes",
