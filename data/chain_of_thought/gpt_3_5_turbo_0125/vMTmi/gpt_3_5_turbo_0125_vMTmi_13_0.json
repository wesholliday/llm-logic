(Premise)\n2. The truck might not have been blue. (Premise)\n\nFrom the first premise, we can infer that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. However, the second premise states that the truck might not have been blue, which contradicts the first premise. This contradiction means that the argument is not logically valid.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: no",
