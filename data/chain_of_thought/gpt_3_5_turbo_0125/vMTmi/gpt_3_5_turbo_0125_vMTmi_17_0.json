(Premise)\n2. Kate might not have eaten salad. (Premise)\n\nFrom the first premise, we can infer the contrapositive: If Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta. This is based on the logical relationship between a conditional statement and its contrapositive.\n\n3. If Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta. (Inference from Premise 1)\n4. Kate might not have eaten salad. (Premise)\n\nFrom premises 3 and 4, we can conclude that Ben did not eat pasta, based on the fact that Kate might not have eaten salad, which implies that Ben did not eat pasta according to the contrapositive relationship established earlier.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
