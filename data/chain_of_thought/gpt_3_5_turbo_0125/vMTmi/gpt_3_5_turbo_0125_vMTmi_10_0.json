From the first premise, if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\n3. But the second premise states that the cat might not have been outside, which contradicts the first premise.\n4. Therefore, our assumption that the dog was inside leads to a contradiction.\n5. Thus, the conclusion that the dog was not inside must be true.\n\nThis argument is logically valid because the premises lead to the conclusion without any logical inconsistencies. \n\nAnswer: yes",
