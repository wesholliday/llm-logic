If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel. (Premise)\n2. The book might not be a mystery novel. (Premise)\n\nFrom the first premise, we can infer that if the book is not a mystery novel, then it was not written by James. This is based on the contrapositive of the first premise.\n\nTherefore, if the book might not be a mystery novel (as stated in the second premise), then it follows logically that the book was not written by James.\n\nGiven the logical connection between the premises and the conclusion, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
