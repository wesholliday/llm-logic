If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den. This premise can be represented as: \n    - Bear in cave -> Wolf in den\n\n2. The wolf might not have been in the den. This premise can be represented as the negation of the consequent in the first premise:\n    - ~Wolf in den\n\n3. The conclusion is 'The bear was not in the cave'. This conclusion can be represented as the negation of the antecedent in the first premise:\n    - ~Bear in cave\n\nNow, let's analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n- Premise 1: Bear in cave -> Wolf in den\n- Premise 2: ~Wolf in den\n- Conclusion: ~Bear in cave\n\nGiven the premises and the conclusion, if we assume that the premises are true, and the conclusion is false, we can see that it is possible for the premises to be true while the conclusion is false. This is because the premises do not necessarily lead to the conclusion based on the rules of implication and negation.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: no",
