(Premise)\n2. Bob might not have chosen pasta. (Premise)\n\nFrom premise 1, if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. However, premise 2 states that Bob might not have chosen pasta. This means that Sue did not choose pizza, as if she did, Bob would have had to choose pasta according to premise 1. Therefore, the conclusion 'Sue did not choose pizza' logically follows from the premises given.\n\nAnswer: yes",
