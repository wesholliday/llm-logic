            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze it using the rules of logical reasoning. \n\n1. The first premise states: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A, then B (A -> B).\n\n2. The second premise states: \"The muffins might not have been blueberry.\" This means that it is possible that the muffins were not blueberry, which can be represented as ~B (not B).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The cake was not chocolate.\" This is the negation of the antecedent in the first premise, which can be represented as ~A (not A).\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\n- If the cake was chocolate (A), then the muffins must have been blueberry (B) (A -> B).\n- The muffins might not have been blueberry (~B).\n- Therefore, the cake was not chocolate (~A).\n\nBy using modus tollens (the rule of inference that allows us to infer the negation of the antecedent from the negation of the consequent in a conditional statement), we can see that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
