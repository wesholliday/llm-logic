            "content": "To determine the logical validity of the argument, we can analyze it using the rules of deductive reasoning. \n\n1. The first premise states: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\" This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q.\"\n\n2. The second premise states: \"The pants might not have been denim.\" This introduces the possibility that the antecedent of the conditional statement in the first premise (shirt was cotton) did not occur.\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is: \"The shirt was not cotton.\" This conclusion is based on the negation of the consequent of the conditional statement in the first premise (pants were denim).\n\nGiven the premises and conclusion, the argument follows the form of denying the consequent (modus tollens) logical form. This form is valid in deductive reasoning. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
