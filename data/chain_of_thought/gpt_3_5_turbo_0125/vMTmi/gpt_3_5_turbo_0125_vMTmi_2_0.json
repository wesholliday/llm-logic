If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest. This can be represented as: G \u2192 U\n2. The unicorn might not have been in the forest. This can be represented as: \u00acU\n\nNow, let's consider the contrapositive of premise 1: \u00acU \u2192 \u00acG. This means if the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nGiven that premise 2 states that the unicorn might not have been in the forest (\u00acU), according to the contrapositive of premise 1, it follows that the griffin was not in the forest (\u00acG).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion 'The griffin was not in the forest' logically follows from the premises. \n\nAnswer: yes",
