The first premise states: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\"\n2. The second premise states: \"Sue might not have been at the wedding.\"\n\nFrom the first premise, we can infer that if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary could not have been at the wedding. This is because the first premise establishes a necessary condition for Mary's presence at the wedding (Sue being there). If that condition is not met (Sue not being there), then Mary cannot be at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, based on the premises given, the conclusion \"Mary was not at the wedding\" logically follows. \n\nAnswer: yes",
