The first premise states: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\" This can be represented as: V -> M\n\n2. The second premise states: \"The mummy might not have been awake.\" This can be represented as: ~M\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The vampire was not awake.\" This can be represented as: ~V\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\n- If the vampire was awake (V), then the mummy must have been awake (M): V -> M\n- The mummy might not have been awake: ~M\n\nFrom these premises, we cannot directly conclude that the vampire was not awake (~V). The argument does not provide enough information to make this deduction. It is possible that the mummy was not awake, but it does not necessarily mean that the vampire was not awake.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises. \n\nAnswer: no",
