(Premise)\n2. Chris might not have finished the race. (Premise)\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer the contrapositive: If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\n\n3. If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race. (Inference from premise 1)\n\nGiven premise 2, we can conclude that Chris did not finish the race.\n\n4. Chris did not finish the race. (Premise)\n\nCombining statements 3 and 4, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\n5. Alex did not finish the race. (Inference from statements 3 and 4)\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
