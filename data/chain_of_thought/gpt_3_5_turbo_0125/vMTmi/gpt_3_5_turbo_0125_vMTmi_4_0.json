The first premise states: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\"\n2. The second premise states: \"The robot might not have visited Jupiter.\"\n\nGiven these premises, we can see that if the robot did not visit Jupiter (as stated in the second premise), then the first premise does not provide any information about whether the alien visited Mars or not. The first premise only establishes a condition for the robot visiting Jupiter if the alien visited Mars. Since the robot might not have visited Jupiter, we cannot conclude anything about the alien visiting Mars based on the given premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises provided. \n\nAnswer: no",
