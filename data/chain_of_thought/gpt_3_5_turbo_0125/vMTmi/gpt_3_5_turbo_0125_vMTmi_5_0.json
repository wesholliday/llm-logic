Assume the premises are true:\n   - If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\n   - Amy might not have played tennis.\n\n2. Assume the conclusion is false:\n   - Jeff played basketball.\n\n3. From the first premise, if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. Since we assumed Jeff played basketball, it follows that Amy played tennis.\n\n4. However, the second premise states that Amy might not have played tennis, which contradicts our previous conclusion that Amy played tennis.\n\n5. Since assuming the conclusion leads to a contradiction, the argument is logically valid.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
