The banana might not have been yellow.\n3. Therefore, the apple was not red.\n\nGiven the first premise, if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. The second premise states that the banana might not have been yellow, which contradicts the first premise. If the banana might not have been yellow, then the first premise does not hold true. Therefore, the conclusion that the apple was not red is logically valid based on the premises provided.\n\nAnswer: yes",
