This tells us something about what Mark did not buy.\n2. The second statement is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'. This is a conditional statement.\n3. If we take the contrapositive of the second statement, it becomes 'If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\n4. Combining the information from the first statement and the contrapositive of the second statement, we can conclude that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
