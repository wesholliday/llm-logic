It tells us that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nNow, if the truck was not metal (from the first statement), it means the doll cannot be plastic according to the conditional statement. This is because the condition in the conditional statement is not met (the truck being metal), so the consequent (the doll being plastic) is not valid.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",

This is the same as saying ~D \u2228 T (the negation of 'the doll was plastic' or 'the truck was metal').\n\nNow, we are trying to infer \"The doll was not plastic\". Let's denote this statement as ~D (the doll was not plastic).\n\nTo see if we can infer ~D from the given information, we can use the law of contraposition, which states that if P \u2192 Q is true, then ~Q \u2192 ~P is also true.\n\nSo, in this case, since D \u2192 T is true, we can also infer ~T \u2192 ~D. Since we know that ~T is true (\"The truck was not metal\"), we can conclude that ~D is also true (\"The doll was not plastic\").\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The doll was not plastic\" from the given information.",
