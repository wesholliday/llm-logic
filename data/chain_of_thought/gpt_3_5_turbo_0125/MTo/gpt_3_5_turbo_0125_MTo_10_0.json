It means that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we know that the cat was inside and that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. Since the cat was inside, it must mean that the dog was not inside. Therefore, we can infer that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
