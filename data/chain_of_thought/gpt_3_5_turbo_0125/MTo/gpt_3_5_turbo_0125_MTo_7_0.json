If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that Chris did not finish the race. \n\nFrom the second statement, we can infer the contrapositive: If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race. This is because the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, if Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\n\nNow, let's put it all together:\n\n1. Chris did not finish the race.\n2. If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\n\nFrom the above two statements, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.",
