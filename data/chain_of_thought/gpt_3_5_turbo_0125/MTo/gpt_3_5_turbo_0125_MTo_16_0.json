If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the pants were not denim. This means the pants were made of a material other than denim.\n\nFrom statement 2, we have a conditional statement: If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. Since we know the pants were not denim, it must be the case that the shirt was not cotton. If the shirt were cotton, then the pants would have been denim according to the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
