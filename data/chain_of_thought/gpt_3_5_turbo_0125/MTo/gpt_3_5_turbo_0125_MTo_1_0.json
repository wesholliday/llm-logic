If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that Sue was not at the wedding. \n\nFrom statement 2, we can infer the contrapositive: If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding. This is because the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
