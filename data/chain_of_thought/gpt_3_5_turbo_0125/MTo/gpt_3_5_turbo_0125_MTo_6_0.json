If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that Bob did not choose pasta. From the second statement, we have a conditional statement: If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. This means that if Sue chose pizza, Bob would have chosen pasta. Since we know Bob did not choose pasta, it implies that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
