The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" \n\nGiven:\n1. The robot did not visit Jupiter.\n2. If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nContrapositive of statement 2:\n- If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nSince we know the robot did not visit Jupiter (from statement 1), we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars based on the contrapositive of statement 2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'yes'. \n\nAnswer: yes",
