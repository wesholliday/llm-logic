If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nGiven these statements, we know that Lucy did not go to the zoo. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy would have gone to the zoo. But since Lucy did not go to the zoo, it implies that Joe did not go to the park. \n\nTherefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
