It means that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer the following:\n- If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave (based on the second statement).\n- If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den (based on the second statement).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes",
