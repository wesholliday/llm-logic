If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. \n\nFrom statement 2, we have a conditional statement: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This means that if Lisa bought the red shirt, Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nNow, if we assume that Lisa did buy the red shirt, then Mark would have bought the blue shirt according to statement 2. But we know from statement 1 that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. Therefore, our assumption that Lisa bought the red shirt leads to a contradiction.\n\nSo, based on the given statements, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
