If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\n\nFrom the second statement, we can infer the contrapositive: If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta. This is because the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, if Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nNow, let's put it all together:\n\n1. Kate did not eat the salad.\n2. If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nFrom the above statements, we can conclude that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
