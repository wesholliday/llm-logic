If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that Jen did not watch basketball. From statement 2, we have a conditional statement: If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. \n\nIf we assume the contrapositive of the conditional statement, it would be: If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football. \n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and the contrapositive of the conditional statement, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
