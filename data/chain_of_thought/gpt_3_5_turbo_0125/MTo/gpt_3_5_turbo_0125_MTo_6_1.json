If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta: P(S \u2192 P(B))\n\nWe want to find out if we can conclude \u00acP(S) based on these statements. Let's analyze:\n\n1. If Bob did not choose pasta (\u00acP(B)), it does not provide us with direct information about Sue's choice.\n2. The statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" suggests a conditional relationship: If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. This does not directly tell us what Sue actually chose, only what Bob chose if Sue chose pizza.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot definitively infer that Sue did not choose pizza (\u00acP(S)). This is because we do not have direct information about Sue's choice in the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
