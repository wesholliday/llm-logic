In classical logic, if the antecedent of an implication is false, then the implication is considered to be true.\n5. Therefore, the statement 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest' is vacuously true, meaning the griffin being in the forest does not necessarily make the unicorn be in the forest.\n6.

The statement \"The unicorn was not in the forest\" tells us that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n2. The statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" can be represented as: If G \u2192 U (griffin in forest implies unicorn in forest).\n3. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of G \u2192 U is \u00acU \u2192 \u00acG (not unicorn in forest implies not griffin in forest).\n\nGiven the above steps, here is the logical reasoning:\n- If the unicorn was not in the forest (\u00acU), according to the contrapositive, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest (\u00acG).\n\nTherefore, based on the statements provided, we can infer that 'The griffin was not in the forest'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
