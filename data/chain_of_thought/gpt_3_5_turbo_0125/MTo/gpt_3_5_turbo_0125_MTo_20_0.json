            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'The apple was not red' from the given statements, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"The banana was not yellow\" - This statement tells us that the banana was a color other than yellow.\n\n2. \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" - This is a conditional statement. It means that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. However, we know from the first statement that the banana was not yellow.\n\nCombining the two statements, we can infer that the apple was not red. This is because if the apple was red, then the banana would have been yellow according to the conditional statement. But since the banana was not yellow, it means the condition of the apple being red was not met.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The apple was not red'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
