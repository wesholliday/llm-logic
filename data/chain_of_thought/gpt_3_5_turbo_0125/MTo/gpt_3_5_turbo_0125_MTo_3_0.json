This means that if the book is a mystery novel, then it must have been written by James.\n\nNow, if we combine the two statements, we can infer that since the book is not a mystery novel (from statement 1), it cannot have been written by James (from statement 2).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The book was not written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
