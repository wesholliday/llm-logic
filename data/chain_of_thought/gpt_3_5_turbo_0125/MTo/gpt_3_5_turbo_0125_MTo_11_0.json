From the statement \"The muffins were not blueberry,\" we can infer that the muffins were not blueberry-flavored.\n\n2. From the conditional statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry,\" we can infer that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry-flavored.\n\n3. Combining the two statements, we know that the muffins were not blueberry-flavored. Therefore, the cake cannot be chocolate because if it were chocolate, the muffins would have been blueberry-flavored according to the second statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
