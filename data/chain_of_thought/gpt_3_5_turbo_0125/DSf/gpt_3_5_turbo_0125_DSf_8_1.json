The remote control isn't hiding under the couch.\n   - This statement eliminates the possibility of the remote control being under the couch.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can conclude that if the remote control is not hiding under the couch, then it must be on the coffee table based on the first statement. This is because there are only two given possibilities, and one of them has been eliminated.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
