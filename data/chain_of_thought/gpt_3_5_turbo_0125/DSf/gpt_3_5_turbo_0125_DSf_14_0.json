The second statement is \"The milk isn't chilling in the fridge.\"\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that if the milk is not chilling in the fridge, then it must be on the counter because the first statement tells us that the milk must be in one of those two places.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
