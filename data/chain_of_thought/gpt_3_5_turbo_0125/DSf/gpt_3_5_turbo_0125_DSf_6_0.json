Since statement 2 tells us that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen, we can infer that the phone must be in the living room. This is because if the phone is not in the kitchen and it is either in the kitchen or the living room, then it must be in the living room.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The phone is in the living room.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
