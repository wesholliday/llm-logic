The book isn't resting on the table.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that the book must be on the shelf. This is because if the book is not resting on the table (as stated in the second statement), and the first statement tells us that the book is either on the table or on the shelf, then the only remaining option is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
