The scarf is draped on the coat rack.\n2. The scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nSince we know that the scarf isn't draped on the coat rack, we can conclude that the first part of the statement is false. This means that the second part, \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack,\" must be true in order for the original statement to be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
