The statement \"Either the pen is on my desk or it is in my bag\" is a logical disjunction, which means at least one of the options must be true, but not necessarily both.\n\n2. The statement \"The pen isn't on my desk\" is a negation, indicating that the pen is not on the desk.\n\n3. If we combine the two statements, we know that the pen is not on the desk, which means the first option in the disjunction (\"the pen is on my desk\") is false.\n\n4. Since the pen is not on the desk, the only remaining option in the disjunction is that the pen is in the bag.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The pen is in my bag.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
