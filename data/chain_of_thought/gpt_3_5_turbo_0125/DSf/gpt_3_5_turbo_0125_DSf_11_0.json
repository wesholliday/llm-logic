The newspaper isn't sitting on the porch.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that the newspaper must be in the driveway. This is because if the newspaper is not sitting on the porch (as stated in the second statement), and the first statement tells us that the newspaper is either on the porch or in the driveway, then the only remaining option is that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes",
