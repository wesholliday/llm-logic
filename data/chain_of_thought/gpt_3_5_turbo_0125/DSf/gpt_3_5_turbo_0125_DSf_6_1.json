Therefore, it must be true that the phone is in the living room, because it is one of the two options listed in statement 1.\n\nNow, considering the logic between the statements, if the phone is not in the kitchen and the options are either ringing in the kitchen or in the living room, then the only remaining option is that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes",

The statement \"Either the phone is ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room\" can be represented as: $(P \\lor Q)$ , where $P$ represents \"the phone is ringing in the kitchen\" and $Q$ represents \"the phone is in the living room\".\n\n2. The statement \"The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen\" can be represented as: $\\neg P$.\n\nNow, if we know that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen, it means $\\neg P$ is true. From the first statement $(P \\lor Q)$, we see that either $P$ or $Q$ is true (or both). But since we know $\\neg P$ is true, then $Q$ must be true (since only one of them can be true).
