The first statement is: \"Either the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the missing puzzle piece is either on the floor or in the box. \nFrom the second statement, we know that the missing puzzle piece is not on the floor.\n\nTherefore, if the missing puzzle piece is not on the floor, it must be in the box based on the first statement. \n\nAnswer: yes",
