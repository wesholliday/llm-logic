The sunglasses aren't perched on her head.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the sunglasses must be in one of two places: either perched on her head or in her bag. Since statement 2 tells us that the sunglasses are not perched on her head, the only remaining option is that they are in her bag. Therefore, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
