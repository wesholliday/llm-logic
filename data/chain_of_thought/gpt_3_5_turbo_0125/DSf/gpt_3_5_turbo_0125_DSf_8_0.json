Since the first statement states that the remote control is either under the couch or on the coffee table, and we have ruled out the possibility of it being under the couch, we can conclude that it must be on the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
