The second statement is \"The toy isn't sitting on the shelf.\"\n\nGiven these two statements, we can analyze them together:\n\n- If the toy is not sitting on the shelf, then it must be in the toy box according to the first statement.\n- The first statement also states that the toy is either on the shelf or in the toy box, and we know it is not on the shelf.\n- Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
