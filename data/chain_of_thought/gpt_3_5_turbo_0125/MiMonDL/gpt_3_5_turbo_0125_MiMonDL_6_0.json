Adding \"or boring\" to this statement does not change the original statement. By including \"or boring\", we are simply expanding the range of possibilities to include both interesting and boring. Therefore, we can infer \"The movie might be interesting or boring\" from the original statement \"The movie might be interesting\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
