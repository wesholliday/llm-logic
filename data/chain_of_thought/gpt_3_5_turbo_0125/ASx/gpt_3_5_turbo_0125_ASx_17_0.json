The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\" This means that if A is true, then B must also be true. \n\nThe second statement is a compound statement with two conditions: \"If A and C, then B.\" In this case, we have an additional condition C (the bloop is zorped) along with the original condition A (the glop is on the brink). \n\nTo infer the second statement from the first, we need to ensure that the original condition A (the glop is on the brink) is met, and then check if the additional condition C (the bloop is zorped) has any impact on the conclusion B (the skrizzle is plonked). \n\nIf the original statement does not mention anything about the bloop being zorped or its relationship to the skrizzle being plonked, we cannot infer the second statement from the first. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first without additional information.",
