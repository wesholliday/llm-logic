The first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\" This means that whenever A is true, B must also be true. \n\nThe second statement introduces an additional condition, \"the snarp is flooping,\" to the original statement. In order to infer the second statement from the first, we need to ensure that the new condition does not affect the truth of the original conditional relationship between the fribble and being flugged.\n\nIf the original statement \"If the fribble is in the snarp, then it is flugged\" does not specify any conditions about the snarp itself (other than the fribble being in it), then adding the condition \"the snarp is flooping\" to the second statement does not necessarily change the original relationship between the fribble and being flugged.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the second statement from the first if the original statement does not depend on the state of the snarp itself.",
