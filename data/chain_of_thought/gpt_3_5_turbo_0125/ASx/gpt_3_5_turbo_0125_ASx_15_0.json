The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the glunk snarbles, then the blip will be floinked.\" This can be represented as: \nIf A, then B.\n\nThe second statement adds a condition: \"If the glunk snarbles and the troon is zibbled, then the blip will be floinked.\" This can be represented as: \nIf A and C, then B.\n\nTo infer the second statement from the first, we need to ensure that the new condition (C) does not contradict the original statement. In this case, adding the condition \"the troon is zibbled\" does not contradict the original statement about the glunk snarbling. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
