The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q.\" The second statement is a combination of the first statement with an additional condition, forming a compound statement in the form \"If P and R, then Q.\"\n\nIn logic, the implication \"If P, then Q\" does not necessarily mean that \"If P and R, then Q\" is true. The second statement adds an extra condition (R) to the original statement, which may or may not affect the truth of the implication.\n\nTherefore, we cannot directly infer the second statement from the first without additional information or context.\n\nAnswer: no",
