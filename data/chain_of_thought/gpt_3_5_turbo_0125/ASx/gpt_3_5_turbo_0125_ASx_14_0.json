The first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q.\" This means that whenever P is true, Q must also be true. \n\nThe second statement is a combination of the first statement with an additional condition: \"If P and R, then Q.\" In this case, we are adding a new condition R (the sklonk is grooped) to the original statement. \n\nTo determine if the second statement can be inferred from the first, we need to check if the new condition R (the sklonk is grooped) has any impact on the truth of the original statement. Since the original statement only mentions the frizzle being dinked as a condition for the zarp to splunk, the addition of the sklonk being grooped does not affect the truth of the original statement. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
