This means that whenever the zonk is twiddled, it will always result in pluzzling.\n\nNow, when we introduce the additional condition of the zonk being blorped in the second statement, we need to consider if the blorping of the zonk has any impact on the pluzzling outcome. If the blorping of the zonk is irrelevant to the pluzzling process and only the twiddling matters, then we can infer the second statement from the first. However, if the blorping of the zonk has a significant effect on whether it will pluzzle, then we cannot make that inference.\n\nTherefore, to determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to establish whether the blorping of the zonk has any influence on the pluzzling outcome based on the information provided in the statements.",
