The first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\" This means that whenever A happens, B will also happen.\n\nThe second statement is a combination of two conditions: \"the zibble is zapped\" and \"the quib is squinked,\" leading to the same conclusion \"the glorp will zoon.\" \n\nSince the second statement includes the condition \"the zibble is zapped,\" which is already present in the first statement, and the conclusion remains the same, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
