The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\" The second statement adds a condition to the first statement, making it a compound conditional statement.\n\nIn the first statement, \"If you glurp, it will hurt my snarfs,\" we can represent it as \"If you glurp (A), then it will hurt my snarfs (B).\"\n\nThe second statement, \"If you glurp and I am wearing plorks, it will hurt my snarfs,\" can be represented as \"If you glurp (A) and I am wearing plorks (C), then it will hurt my snarfs (B).\"\n\nSince the second statement includes the condition \"I am wearing plorks (C)\" in addition to the original condition \"If you glurp (A),\" we cannot directly infer the second statement from the first without additional information. The second statement introduces a new condition that was not present in the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first statement alone.",
