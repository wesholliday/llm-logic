The first statement tells us that when the tizzer is on, the goom is snurpled. The second statement introduces a new element, the plink light, and states that when both the tizzer is on and the plink light is out, the goom is snurpled. \n\nGiven that the first statement only provides information about the tizzer being on and its relationship to the goom being snurpled, we cannot directly infer the second statement without additional information about the plink light. The introduction of the plink light in the second statement changes the scenario and requires separate confirmation or information about its relationship with the goom being snurpled. \n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer the second statement from the first.",
