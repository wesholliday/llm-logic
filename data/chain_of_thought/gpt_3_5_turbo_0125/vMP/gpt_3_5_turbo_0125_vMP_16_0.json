            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze it using the rules of deductive reasoning. The argument is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If A, then B\" (If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim), and it also provides the premise that A is true (The shirt was cotton). \n\nGiven these premises, we can logically conclude that B must be true (The pants were denim) based on the conditional statement. This is because if the antecedent (A) is true, and the conditional statement is true, then the consequent (B) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
