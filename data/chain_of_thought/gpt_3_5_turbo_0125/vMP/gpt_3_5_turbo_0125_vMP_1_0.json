The first premise states \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be represented as: Mary at wedding \u2192 Sue at wedding.\n\nThe second premise states \"Mary was at the wedding,\" which can be represented as: Mary at wedding.\n\nNow, if we combine the first premise with the second premise using the rule of modus ponens (If P then Q, P, therefore Q), we get: Sue at wedding.\n\nTherefore, based on the premises and the valid logical inference, the conclusion 'Sue was at the wedding' logically follows. \n\nAnswer: yes",
