            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze it using the rules of deductive reasoning. The argument is a conditional statement in the form of \"If A, then B\" where A is the apple being red and B is the banana being yellow. The first premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. The second premise states that the apple was red. From these premises, we can logically conclude that the banana was yellow based on the conditional relationship established in the first premise. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
