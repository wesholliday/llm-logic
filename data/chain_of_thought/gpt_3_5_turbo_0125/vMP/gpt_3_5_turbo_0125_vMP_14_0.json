If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. (Premise)\n2. The bear was in the cave. (Premise)\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. Since the second premise states that the bear was indeed in the cave, it follows logically that the wolf was in the den.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
