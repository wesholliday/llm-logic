The argument is structured as a conditional statement in the first premise: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" The second premise states that Ben ate pasta. From these premises, we can infer that Kate must have eaten salad based on the conditional relationship given in the first premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows logically from the premises according to the rules of deductive reasoning.",
