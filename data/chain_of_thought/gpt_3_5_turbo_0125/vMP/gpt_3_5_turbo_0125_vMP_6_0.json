The argument is structured as a conditional statement in the first premise: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" The second premise states that Sue chose pizza. From these premises, we can infer that Bob chose pasta based on the conditional relationship established in the first premise. Therefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
