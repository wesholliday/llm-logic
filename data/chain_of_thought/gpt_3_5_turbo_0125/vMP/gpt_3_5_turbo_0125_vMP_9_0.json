            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze it using the rules of deductive reasoning. The argument is structured as a conditional statement in the form of a hypothetical syllogism:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n2. Lisa bought the red shirt.\n3. Therefore, Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nGiven the premises, if we assume that both premises are true, then the conclusion logically follows. This is because if the first premise is true (Lisa bought the red shirt), and the conditional statement in the first premise is true (If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt), then the conclusion that Mark bought the blue shirt must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
