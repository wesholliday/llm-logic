If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. (Premise)\n2. Joe went to the park. (Premise)\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer that Joe going to the park implies Lucy going to the zoo. Since we are given that Joe went to the park, it follows that Lucy must have gone to the zoo based on the first premise. Therefore, the conclusion 'Lucy went to the zoo' logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
