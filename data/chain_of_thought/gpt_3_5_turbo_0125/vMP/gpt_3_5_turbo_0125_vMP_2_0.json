The first premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. The second premise states that the griffin was in the forest. From these two premises, we can infer that the unicorn was in the forest based on the rule of modus ponens, which allows us to conclude that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent is also true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.",
