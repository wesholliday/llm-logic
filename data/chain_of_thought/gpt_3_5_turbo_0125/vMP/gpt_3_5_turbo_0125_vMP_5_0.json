            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze it using the rules of deductive reasoning. The argument is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" The second premise states that Jeff played basketball. From these premises, we can infer that Amy played tennis based on the conditional statement. This is a valid form of argument known as modus ponens, which states that if the antecedent of a conditional statement is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
