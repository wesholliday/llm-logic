The argument is structured as a conditional statement in the first premise and an assertion in the second premise. \n\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. (Premise)\n2. The vampire was awake. (Premise)\n3. Therefore, the mummy was awake. (Conclusion)\n\nGiven the first premise, if the vampire was indeed awake (as stated in the second premise), then according to the conditional statement in the first premise, the mummy must also be awake. This is a valid application of modus ponens, a valid form of deductive reasoning.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
