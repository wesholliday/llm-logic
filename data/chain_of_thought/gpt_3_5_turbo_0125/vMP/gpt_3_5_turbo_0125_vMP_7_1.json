The argument follows the form of a syllogism called Modus Ponens, which is a valid deductive argument form. Modus Ponens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P then Q\" and we are given that P is true, then we can conclude that Q is also true. In this case, the first premise \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" corresponds to \"If P then Q\", and the second premise \"Alex finished the race\" corresponds to P. By applying Modus Ponens, we can deduce that the conclusion \"Chris finished the race\" is true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
