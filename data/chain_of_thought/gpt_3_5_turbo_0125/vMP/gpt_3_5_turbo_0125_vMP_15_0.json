The argument is structured as a conditional statement in the form of a hypothetical syllogism:\n\n1. If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. (Premise)\n2. Sam took a plane. (Premise)\n3. Therefore, Erin took a train. (Conclusion)\n\nGiven the premises, if we assume that both premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true based on the logical relationship established in the premises. This is because if the first premise is true (If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train) and the second premise is true (Sam took a plane), then the conclusion (Erin took a train) logically follows.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
