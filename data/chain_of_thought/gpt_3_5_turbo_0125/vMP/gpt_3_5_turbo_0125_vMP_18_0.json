The argument is a conditional statement in the form of \"If A, then B\" as the first premise. The second premise affirms the antecedent, stating that \"A\" is true. Therefore, based on modus ponens (a valid form of argument), the conclusion that \"B\" is true can be logically inferred. \n\nAnswer: yes",
