The argument follows the form of a valid deductive argument known as modus ponens. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, then we can logically conclude that B is true.\n\nIn this case:\n- Premise 1: If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n- Premise 2: The book was written by James.\n\nBy applying modus ponens, we can conclude:\n- Conclusion: The book is a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
