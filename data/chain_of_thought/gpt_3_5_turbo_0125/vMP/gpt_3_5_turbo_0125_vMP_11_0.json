The argument is structured as a conditional statement in the first premise and an affirmation of the antecedent in the second premise. Given the form of the argument, if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. This is because the conclusion directly follows from the premises based on the rules of conditional statements.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
