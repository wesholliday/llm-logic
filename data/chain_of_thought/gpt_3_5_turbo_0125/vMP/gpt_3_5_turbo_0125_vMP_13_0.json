The argument is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" Given the second premise that \"The car was red,\" we can infer from the first premise that \"the truck was blue.\" This is because if the antecedent of a conditional statement is true, then the consequent must also be true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
