This means that if the meeting was not at 2 PM, then it must have been cancelled. However, it does not necessarily mean that the meeting was at 2 PM. It could have been cancelled instead. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the meeting must have been at 2 PM based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
