The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was not yellow\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"If not Q, then not P\", which would be \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red\". Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
