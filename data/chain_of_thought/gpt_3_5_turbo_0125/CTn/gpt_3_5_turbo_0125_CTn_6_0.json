            "content": "To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\" The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of the first statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta\" is \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\" This is the same as the second statement we are trying to infer.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the second statement from the first statement. \n\nAnswer: yes",
