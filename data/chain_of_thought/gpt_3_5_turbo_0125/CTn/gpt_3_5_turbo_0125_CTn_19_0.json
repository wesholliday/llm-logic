The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q.\" The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nIn this case, the first statement is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\" The contrapositive of this statement would be \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
