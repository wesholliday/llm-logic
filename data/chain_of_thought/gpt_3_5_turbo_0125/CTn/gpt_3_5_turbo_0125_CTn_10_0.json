The contrapositive of a conditional statement switches the hypothesis and conclusion and negates both. \n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement is: \nCat outside \u2192 Dog not inside\n\nTherefore, based on the logical relationship between the original statement and its contrapositive, we can infer that \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
