            "content": "To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. The original statement is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If A, then B.\" In this case, A is \"the vampire was awake\" and B is \"the mummy was not awake.\"\n\nWhen we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B,\" the contrapositive of that statement is \"If not B, then not A.\" This is a logically equivalent statement to the original conditional statement.\n\nSo, in this case, the contrapositive of the original statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was not awake\" would be \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer the statement \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
