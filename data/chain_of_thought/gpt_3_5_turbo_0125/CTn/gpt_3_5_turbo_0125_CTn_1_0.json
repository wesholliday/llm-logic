The contrapositive of 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. \n\nGiven the original statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding', we can rewrite it as 'If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding'. \n\nNow, if we apply the contrapositive rule to this new statement, we get 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding'. \n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding' from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: yes",
