In this case, the original statement is \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was not metal\". \n\nThe contrapositive of this statement would be \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic\". This is because we switch the positions of the terms and negate both terms. \n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic' from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: yes",
