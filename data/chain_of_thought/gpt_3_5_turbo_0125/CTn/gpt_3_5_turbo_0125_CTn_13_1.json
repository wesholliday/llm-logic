In this case:\n- If the truck was blue, then the car was red. \n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'If the truck was blue, then the car was red' based on the original statement. \n\nAnswer: yes",

In the first statement, the color of the car impacts the color of the truck. However, in the second statement, the color of the truck is just being related to the color of the car independently.
