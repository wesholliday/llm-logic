In a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B\", the contrapositive is \"If not B, then not A\".\n3. To find the contrapositive of the original statement, we first need to negate the original statement.\n4. The negation of \"Tom watched football\" is \"Tom did not watch football\", and the negation of \"Jen did not watch basketball\" is \"Jen watched basketball\".\n5. So the negated statement is: \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen watched basketball\".\n6. Therefore, the contrapositive of the negated statement is: \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom watched football\".\n7. Comparing this with the original statement, we find that the contrapositive of the original statement is: \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football\".\n\nTherefore, the new statement we inferred is: \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football\".\nAnswer: yes",
