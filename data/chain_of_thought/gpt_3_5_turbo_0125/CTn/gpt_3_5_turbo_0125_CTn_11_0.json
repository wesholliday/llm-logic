In this case, the original statement is \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\" The contrapositive of this statement would be \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the contrapositive of the original statement, we can infer the statement \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
