This would result in: If B, then not A (If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James).\n\nTherefore, based on the logical relationship between the original statement and the inferred statement, we can indeed infer the statement \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
