If Bob chose pasta, considering the first statement (Sue \u2192 \u00acBob), it does not provide any information about what Sue chose when Bob picks pasta. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\n2. If Bob did not choose pasta, the first statement (Sue \u2192 \u00acBob) implies that Sue chose pizza, which means that if Bob did choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza. However, this case alone is not sufficient to establish a valid inference.\n\nIn conclusion, the second statement is not necessarily guaranteed by the first statement. Both statements address different scenarios and do not have a direct logical implication between them.\n\nAnswer: no",
