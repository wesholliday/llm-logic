In this case, the contrapositive of 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim' would be 'If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton'.\n\nTherefore, based on the contrapositive rule, we can infer the statement 'If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton' from the given statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
