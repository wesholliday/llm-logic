The first statement is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If A, then B.\" The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nGiven the first statement: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris did not finish the race,\" we can rewrite it as \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris did not finish the race.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the logical relationship between conditional statements and their contrapositives, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
