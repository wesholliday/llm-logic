            "content": "To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. The first statement is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If P, then Q.\" The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nIn this case, the first statement is: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\" The contrapositive of this statement is: \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
