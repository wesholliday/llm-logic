However, we can test the validity of the inference using the contrapositive of the original statement. \n\nThe contrapositive of \"If A, then not B\" is \"If B, then not A.\" Therefore, the contrapositive of the original statement is: \n- If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton. \n\nGiven that the original statement does not specify what material the pants were made of when the shirt is not cotton, we cannot be certain if the contrapositive is true or not.\n\nTherefore, the inference \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton\" cannot be validly inferred from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: no",
