The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\" The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nIn this case, the first statement is \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\" The contrapositive of this statement would be \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\" Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
