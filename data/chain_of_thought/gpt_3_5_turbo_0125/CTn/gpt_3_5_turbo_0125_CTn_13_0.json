The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" \n\nGiven the original statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was not blue,\" we can rewrite it as \"If the car was not red, then the truck was blue\" (contrapositive).\n\nNow, the second statement we want to infer is: \"If the truck was blue, then the car was not red.\" \n\nComparing the contrapositive of the original statement with the second statement we want to infer, we can see that they are not the same. The contrapositive of the original statement does not directly lead to the second statement. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: no",
