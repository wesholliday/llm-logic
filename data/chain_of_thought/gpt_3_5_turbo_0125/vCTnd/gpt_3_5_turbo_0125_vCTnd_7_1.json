Let's represent the conclusion: \nIf the customer was served promptly, then he was not served. \nSymbolically: P \u2192 ~S\n\nNow, the argument can be analyzed as follows:\nPremise: S \u2192 ~P\nConclusion: P \u2192 ~S\n\nTo test the validity, we can examine the form of the argument. The argument follows the form of Modus Tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement A \u2192 B and the negation of B, then we can infer the negation of A. \n\nIn this case, the premise 'S \u2192 ~P' is consistent with the premise of modus tollens (A \u2192 B). The conclusion 'P \u2192 ~S' contains the negation of the consequent, which aligns with the second premise of modus tollens.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it follows the valid form of Modus Tollens.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
