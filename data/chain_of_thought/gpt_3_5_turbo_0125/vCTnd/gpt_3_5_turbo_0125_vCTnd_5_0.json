If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly. (Premise)\n2. If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned. (Conclusion)\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\nIf A, then B. (Premise)\nIf B, then C. (Conclusion)\n\nFrom the premises, we can see that the argument follows the form of a hypothetical syllogism, where the first premise sets up a conditional relationship between A and B, and the conclusion establishes a conditional relationship between B and C. \n\nIn this case, the argument is logically valid because it follows a valid form of reasoning known as hypothetical syllogism. This means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true based on the logical structure of the argument.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
