If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth. (Premise)\n2. If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed. (Conclusion)\n\nLet's break it down:\n\nIf the issue was discussed (P), then it was not discussed in depth (Q). \nIf the issue was discussed in depth (Q), then it was not discussed (R).\n\nFrom the premise, we have P \u2192 \u00acQ. \nFrom the conclusion, we have Q \u2192 \u00acR.\n\nNow, if we combine these two conditional statements, we get:\nP \u2192 \u00acQ\nQ \u2192 \u00acR\n\nBy the transitive property of implication, we can infer:\nP \u2192 \u00acR\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
