The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the premise \"If directions were provided, then they were not explained clearly\" can be rewritten as \"If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided.\" \n\nNow, let's compare the conclusion \"If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided\" with the contrapositive of the premise. If they match, then the argument is logically valid.\n\nContrapositive of the premise: If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided.\nConclusion: If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided.\n\nSince the conclusion matches the contrapositive of the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
