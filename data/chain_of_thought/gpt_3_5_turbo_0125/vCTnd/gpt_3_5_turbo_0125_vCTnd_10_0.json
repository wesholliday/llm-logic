The premise states \"If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice,\" which can be represented as A \u2192 \u00acH. The conclusion states \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered,\" which can be represented as H \u2192 \u00acA.\n\nTo check the validity of the argument, we can use the Law of Contraposition, which states that if a conditional statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. The contrapositive of A \u2192 \u00acH is H \u2192 \u00acA. Since the conclusion matches the contrapositive of the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
