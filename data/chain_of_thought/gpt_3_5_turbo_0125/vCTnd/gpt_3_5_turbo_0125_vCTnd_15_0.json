If the room was tidied, then it was not tidied thoroughly. (Premise)\n2. If the room was not tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied. (Contrapositive of the premise)\n\nBy converting the premise into its contrapositive form, we can see that the conclusion follows logically from the premise. This is because the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
