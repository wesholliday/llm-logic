If the meal was prepared, then it was not prepared carefully. (Premise)\n2. If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared. (Conclusion)\n\nIn a hypothetical syllogism, if the premises are in the form \"If A then B\" and \"If B then C,\" then the conclusion should logically follow as \"If A then C.\" \n\nLet's apply this to the argument:\n- If A (the meal was prepared), then B (it was not prepared carefully).\n- If B (it was not prepared carefully), then C (it was not prepared).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared\" logically follows from the given premise. \n\nAnswer: yes",
