Premise: If the issue was addressed, then it was not addressed effectively.\n2. Conclusion: If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed.\n\nBy analyzing the premise, we can see that it states that if the issue was addressed, then it was not addressed effectively. This implies that addressing the issue and addressing it effectively are mutually exclusive.\n\nNow, looking at the conclusion, it states that if the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed. This conclusion follows from the premise because if addressing the issue and addressing it effectively are mutually exclusive, then if the issue was addressed effectively, it must not have been addressed at all.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
