            "content": "To determine the validity of this argument, let's first translate the statements into symbolic logic:\n\nLet p represent \"I went to the store\" and q represent \"I bought vegetables.\"\n\nThe premise \"If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables\" translates to p -> ~q (If p, then ~q).\n\nThe conclusion \"If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store\" translates to q -> ~p (If q, then ~p).\n\nTo check the logical validity, we need to see if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In other words, we need to see if (p -> ~q) logically implies (q -> ~p).\n\nOne way to do this is to construct a truth table and evaluate the truth values of the statement (p -> ~q) and (q -> ~p). If the column for (p -> ~q) is all true wherever the column for (q -> ~p) is true, then the argument is logically valid.\n\nLet's create a truth table to verify this:\n\n| p | q | ~q | p -> ~q | q -> ~p |\n|---|---|----|---------|---------|\n| T | T |  F |    F    |    F    |\n| T | F |  T |    T    |    T    |\n| F | T |  F |    T    |    T    |\n| F | F |  T |    T    |    T    |\n\nAs we can see from the truth table, when the premise (p -> ~q) is true, the conclusion (q -> ~p) is also true in all cases.
