If the job was completed, then it was not completed well: If A then not B\n2. If the job was completed well, then it was not completed: If B then not C\n\nBy combining the premises, we get:\nIf A then not B (from Premise 1)\nIf not B then not C (from Premise 2)\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"If the job was completed, then it was not completed\" is logically valid based on the given premises. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
