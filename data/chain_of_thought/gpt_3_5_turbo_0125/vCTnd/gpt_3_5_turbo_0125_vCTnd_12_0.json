This can be represented as: J \u2192 \u00acL\n2. Conclusion: If Jane studied long, then she did not study. This can be represented as: L \u2192 \u00acJ\n\nTo check the validity, we can use the contrapositive rule: If P \u2192 Q is true, then \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP is also true.\n\nApplying the contrapositive rule to the premise:\n\u00ac(\u00acL) \u2192 \u00acJ\nThis simplifies to: L \u2192 \u00acJ\n\nComparing the conclusion with the contrapositive of the premise, we see that they match. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
