In this case, the conclusion is not a logical consequence of the premise. The premise talks about the customer being served and not served promptly, while the conclusion talks about the customer being served promptly and not served at all. These statements are not directly related or logically connected based on the given premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: no",
