Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that follows this structure:\n\n1. If A, then B.\n2. Not B.\n3. Therefore, not A.\n\nIn the given argument:\n- Premise: If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much.\n- Conclusion: If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise.\n\nLet's represent the premises in the form of modus tollens:\n1. If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much. (If A, then not B)\n2. Alex exercised much. (A)\n\nFrom the premise, we can infer:\n- If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much. (If A, then not B)\n- Alex exercised much. (A)\n\nHowever, the conclusion states:\n- If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise. (If A, then not A)\n\nComparing the conclusion with the premises, we can see that the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises using the modus tollens form. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
