The second statement can be written as: Not B.\n\n4. From the given information, we have the logical proposition: (A or B) and (Not B). \n\n5. By using the rule of inference called disjunctive syllogism, we can conclude: \n   - If we have a disjunction (A or B) and a negation of one of the disjuncts (Not B), we can infer the other disjunct (A).\n\n6. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
