It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the toy is in one of two places: the toy box or the bookshelf. The second statement tells us that it's not necessary for the toy to be on the bookshelf.\n\nTherefore, if it's not necessary for the toy to be on the bookshelf, and the toy must be in either the toy box or on the bookshelf, then we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
