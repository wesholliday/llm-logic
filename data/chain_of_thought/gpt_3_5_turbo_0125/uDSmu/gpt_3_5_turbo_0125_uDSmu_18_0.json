It's not the case that the notebook must be on the nightstand.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the notebook is in one of two places: the drawer or the nightstand. The second statement tells us that it's not necessary for the notebook to be on the nightstand.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer because it must be in one of the two locations, and it's not required to be on the nightstand.",
