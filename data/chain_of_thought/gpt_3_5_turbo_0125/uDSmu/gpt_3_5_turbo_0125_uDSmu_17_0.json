The scarf is either stuffed in the backpack or draped on the coat rack.\n2. It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the scarf must be in one of two places: the backpack or the coat rack. The second statement tells us that it's not necessary for the scarf to be on the coat rack.\n\nTherefore, the only remaining option is that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack. This is because if it's not on the coat rack and it must be in one of the two places mentioned, then it must be in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
