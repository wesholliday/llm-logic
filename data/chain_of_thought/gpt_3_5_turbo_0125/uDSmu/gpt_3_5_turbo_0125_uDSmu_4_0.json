Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom.\n2. It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the cat is either napping on the couch or playing in the bedroom. If it's not playing in the bedroom, then it must be napping on the couch based on statement 1. Since statement 2 confirms that the cat is not playing in the bedroom, we can infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
