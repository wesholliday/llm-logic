It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the sunglasses must be in one of two places: either in her bag or on her head. The second statement tells us that it's not necessary for the sunglasses to be on her head.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag because they must be in one of the two possible locations, and it's not required for them to be on her head.\n\nAnswer: yes",
