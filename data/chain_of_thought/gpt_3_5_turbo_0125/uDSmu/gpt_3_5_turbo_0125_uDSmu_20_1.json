The statement is a disjunction (\"either...or\"), which means that at least one of the two cases must be true: either the sunglasses are in her bag or they are perched on her head.\n\n2. The second part of the statement denies the possibility that the sunglasses must be perched on her head. This means that the sunglasses cannot only be perched on her head.\n\nCombining these two pieces of information, we can infer that since the sunglasses cannot only be perched on her head, the only remaining possibility is that they are in her bag.
