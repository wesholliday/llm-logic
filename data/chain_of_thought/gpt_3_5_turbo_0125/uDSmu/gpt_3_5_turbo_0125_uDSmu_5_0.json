Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry.\n2. It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the cookies are either in the jar or hidden in the pantry. Since it's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry (statement 2), it means the cookies are not hidden in the pantry. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
