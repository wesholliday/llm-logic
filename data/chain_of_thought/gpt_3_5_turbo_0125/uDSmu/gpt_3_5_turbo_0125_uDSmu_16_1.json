This can be represented as \u00acD (not on desk).\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we have:\n(P OR D) AND \u00acD\n\nBy applying the distributive law in propositional logic, this can be simplified to:\n(P AND \u00acD) OR (D AND \u00acD)\n\nThe second part of the expression (D AND \u00acD) is a contradiction because it states the pen is both on the desk and not on the desk at the same time, which is impossible. So, the only part of the expression that can be true is (P AND \u00acD), which means the pen must be in your bag.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer that the pen is in your bag based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
