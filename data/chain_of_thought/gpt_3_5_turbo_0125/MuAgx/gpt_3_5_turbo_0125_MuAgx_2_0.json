When we remove the second condition from the original statement, we are left with only the first condition, which is \"The gronk must be on the flonk.\" The second condition about zazzling a plimp flim is no longer present in the modified statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that the gronk must zazzle a plimp flim from the modified statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
