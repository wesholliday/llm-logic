            "content": "Explanation: In the original statement, it specifies that the wobble must be both \"wumble fizzle\" and \"frazzle\" at \"wozzle zump\". When we remove the word \"it must\" from the original statement, we are left with \"The wobble must be wumble fizzle and frazzle at wozzle zump\". This new statement still maintains the requirement that the wobble must be both \"wumble fizzle\" and \"frazzle\" at \"wozzle zump\". Therefore, we can infer the new statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
