Since the second statement confirms that the muffins were indeed blueberry, it satisfies the condition of the first statement. However, we cannot definitively conclude that the cake was chocolate based solely on this information. The first statement only establishes a conditional relationship, not a biconditional one.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively say that the cake was chocolate based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
