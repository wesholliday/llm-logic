The first statement given is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This statement does not tell us anything about whether Lisa actually bought the red shirt or not. It only establishes a relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt.\n\n2. The second statement given is a simple statement: \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This statement tells us directly that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nGiven that the conditional statement is true and the statement \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true, we can conclude that Mark indeed bought the blue shirt. However, we cannot definitively determine whether Lisa bought the red shirt based on the information provided. Just because Mark bought the blue shirt does not necessarily mean Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
