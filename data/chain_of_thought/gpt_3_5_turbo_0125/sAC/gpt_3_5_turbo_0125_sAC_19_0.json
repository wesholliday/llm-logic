            "content": "To determine if the statement 'Tom watched football' is true based on the given information, we need to consider the logical relationship between the statements.\n\n1. The first statement given is: 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' is true. This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q.\" In this case, P represents 'Tom watched football' and Q represents 'Jen watched basketball.'\n\n2. The second statement given is: 'Jen watched basketball' is true. This statement provides information about Q, which is the consequent of the conditional statement.\n\nGiven that the conditional statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' is true and 'Jen watched basketball' is true, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If the antecedent of the conditional statement is true (P), then the consequent (Q) must also be true. In this case, since 'Jen watched basketball' is true (Q), it implies that 'Tom watched football' (P) is also true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, it follows that 'Tom watched football' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
