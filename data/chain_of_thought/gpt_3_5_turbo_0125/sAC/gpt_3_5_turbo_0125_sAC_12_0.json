The first statement given is: 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' is true. This is a conditional statement in the form of \"if-then.\" It does not tell us whether Joe actually went to the park, but it establishes a relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo.\n\n2. The second statement given is: 'Lucy went to the zoo' is true. This statement directly tells us that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nBased on the given information, we know that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. We also know that Lucy went to the zoo. However, this does not necessarily mean that Joe went to the park. It is possible that Lucy went to the zoo for a different reason or without Joe going to the park.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively conclude that Joe went to the park. \n\nAnswer: no",
