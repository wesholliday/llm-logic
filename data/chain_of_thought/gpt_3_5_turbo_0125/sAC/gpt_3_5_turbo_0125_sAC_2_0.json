Since the unicorn was indeed in the forest according to the second statement, it satisfies the condition of the first statement. However, the first statement does not provide any information about the griffin's location when the unicorn is in the forest. It only tells us what happens if the griffin is in the forest.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that the griffin was in the forest. The truth value of the statement \"The griffin was in the forest\" cannot be determined solely from the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
