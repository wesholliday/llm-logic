The first statement given is: 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' is true. This is a conditional statement in the form of \"if A, then B.\" In this case, A is \"Alex finished the race\" and B is \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\n2. The second statement given is: 'Chris finished the race' is true. This statement directly tells us that Chris finished the race.\n\nGiven these two statements, we know that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. We also know that Chris finished the race. However, we cannot definitively conclude that Alex finished the race based on this information alone. It is possible that Chris finished the race without Alex finishing it.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively say that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
