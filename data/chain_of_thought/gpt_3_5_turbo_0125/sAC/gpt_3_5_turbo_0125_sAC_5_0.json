The statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is a conditional statement. It can be represented as: Jeff \u2192 Amy.\n\n2. The statement \"Amy played tennis\" is a separate piece of information.\n\n3. From the given information, we know that Amy played tennis. This means that the second part of the conditional statement is true: Amy.\n\n4. However, knowing that Amy played tennis does not provide any information about whether Jeff played basketball. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if Jeff plays basketball, not the other way around.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Jeff played basketball based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
