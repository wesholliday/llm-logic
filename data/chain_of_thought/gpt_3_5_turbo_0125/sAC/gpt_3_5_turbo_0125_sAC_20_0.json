Since the second statement confirms that the banana was indeed yellow, it does not necessarily mean that the apple was red. The first statement only establishes a condition for the color of the banana when the apple is red, but it does not provide any information about the color of the apple when the banana is yellow.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that the apple was red.\n\nAnswer: no",
