Since we are given that the mummy was indeed awake, it satisfies the condition of the first statement.\n\nHowever, the truth of the second statement does not necessarily imply the truth of the first part of the conditional statement. The conditional statement only tells us about the relationship between the vampire and the mummy, not the other way around.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
