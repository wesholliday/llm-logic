Since the second statement confirms that the truck was indeed metal, we can conclude that the antecedent of the conditional statement is true. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the doll was indeed plastic.\n\nTherefore, the statement 'The doll was plastic' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
