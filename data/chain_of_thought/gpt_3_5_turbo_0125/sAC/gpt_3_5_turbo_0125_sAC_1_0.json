The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" \n\nGiven:\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (If Mary -> Sue)\n2. Sue was at the wedding (Sue)\n\nFrom statement 1, we can write the contrapositive:\n3. If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding (If not Sue -> not Mary)\n\nSince Sue was at the wedding (from statement 2), we can conclude that Mary was at the wedding based on the contrapositive of statement 1.\n\nTherefore, 'Mary was at the wedding' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
