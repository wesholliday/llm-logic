The book is a mystery novel (Given as true).\n\nFrom the given statements, we know that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. We also know that the book is indeed a mystery novel. However, we cannot definitively conclude that the book was written by James based on this information alone. It is possible that the book was written by someone else and still falls into the category of a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, the statement 'The book was written by James' cannot be determined to be true based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
