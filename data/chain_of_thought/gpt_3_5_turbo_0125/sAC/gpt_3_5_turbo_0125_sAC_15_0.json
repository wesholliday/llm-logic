This means that if the first part (Sam took a plane) is true, then the second part (Erin took a train) must also be true. However, the truth of the first part does not guarantee the truth of the second part.\n\n2. \"Erin took a train\" is given as true. This means that Erin indeed took a train.\n\nBased on the given information, we know that Erin took a train. However, we do not have any information about whether Sam took a plane or not. The fact that Erin took a train does not provide any direct information about whether Sam took a plane. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Sam took a plane based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
