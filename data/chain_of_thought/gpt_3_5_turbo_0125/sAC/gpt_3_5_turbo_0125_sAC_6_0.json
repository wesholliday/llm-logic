This means that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. However, it does not necessarily mean that Sue actually chose pizza.\n\n2. \"Bob chose pasta\" is a separate statement that tells us Bob's choice.\n\nGiven that Bob chose pasta, we know that the second part of the conditional statement is true. However, this does not provide any information about Sue's choice. Sue could have chosen pizza or something else.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Sue chose pizza based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
