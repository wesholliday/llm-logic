It means that whenever the fribble is snurgled, it will crinkle.\n\n2. \"The fribble was snurgled\" - This statement tells us that the fribble was indeed snurgled.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can conclude that since the fribble was snurgled (as stated in the second statement), and according to the first statement, whenever the fribble is snurgled, it crinkles, we can infer that 'The fribble crinked'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'yes'. Answer: yes",
