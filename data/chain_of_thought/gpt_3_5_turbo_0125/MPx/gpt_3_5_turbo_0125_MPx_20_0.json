The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\"\n2. The second statement is a premise: \"The fleeg was bluttered.\"\n\nGiven these statements, we know that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned. We also know that the fleeg was bluttered. However, we cannot definitively conclude that the fleeg surned based on this information alone. This is because the conditional statement only tells us what happens if the fleeg was bluttered, but it does not provide information about what happens if the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The fleeg surned' from the given statements. \n\nAnswer: no",
