It states that if the dreb was vroombed, then it was spened. This can be represented as: If A, then B (A -> B).\n\n2. \"The dreb was vroombed\" - This is a statement that the dreb was vroombed.\n\nGiven these two statements, we know that if the dreb was vroombed, then it was spened. We also know that the dreb was vroombed. \n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The dreb was spened.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
