The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\"\n2. The second statement is a premise: \"The grommet was sploffed.\"\n\nGiven these statements, we can conclude the following:\n- If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink (from the first statement).\n- The grommet was sploffed (from the second statement).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that \"The grommet plopped the frink.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
