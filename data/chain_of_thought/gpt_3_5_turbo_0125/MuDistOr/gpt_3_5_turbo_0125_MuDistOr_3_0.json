So, when we say \"The book must have been on the shelf or in the backpack\", it covers the possibility that the book could have been on the shelf, in the backpack, or even in both places simultaneously. Therefore, we can infer that \"The book must have been on the shelf or it must have been in the backpack\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
