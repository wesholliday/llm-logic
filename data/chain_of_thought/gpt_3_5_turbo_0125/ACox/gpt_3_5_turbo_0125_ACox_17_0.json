If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle was tinked.\n\nWe want to prove:\n3. The whiffle was shanked.\n\nProof by contraposition:\n- The contrapositive of statement 2 is: If the whiffle was not tinked, then the whiffle was not shanked.\n- Since we know the whiffle was tinked (from statement 1), we can conclude that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the whiffle was shanked.\n\nAnswer: no",
