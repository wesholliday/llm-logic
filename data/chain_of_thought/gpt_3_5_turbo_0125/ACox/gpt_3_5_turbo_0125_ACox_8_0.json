The sprocket was daggled.\n2. If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n\nTo prove by contraposition:\nIf we assume that the sprocket was not cranked, then we can infer that the sprocket was not daggled.\n\nProof:\n- Assume the sprocket was not cranked.\n- Using the contrapositive of statement 2, if the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\n- Since we know the sprocket was daggled (from statement 1), we can conclude that the sprocket was cranked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and the proof by contraposition, we can infer that the sprocket was cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
