Statement 2: \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\"\n\nFrom these statements, we know that:\n- If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\n- The twonk was varnished.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer that \"The twonk was plinked\" from the given statements. Just because the twonk was varnished does not necessarily mean it was plinked. It is possible that the twonk was varnished for reasons other than being plinked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The twonk was plinked\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
