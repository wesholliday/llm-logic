It means that if the flug was blummed, then it was zimmed.\n\nGiven the above statements, we know that the flug was zimmed. However, we cannot directly infer that the flug was blummed based on the information provided. Just because the flug was zimmed does not necessarily mean it was blummed. It could have been zimmed for other reasons.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The flug was blummed\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
