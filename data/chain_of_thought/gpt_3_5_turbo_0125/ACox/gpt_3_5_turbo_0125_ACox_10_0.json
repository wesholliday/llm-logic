If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\n\nWe want to prove:\n3. The wug was sproinged.\n\nProof by contraposition:\n- The contrapositive of statement 2 is: If the wug was not garpled, then it was not sproinged.\n- Since we know the wug was garpled (from statement 1), we can conclude that the wug was sproinged.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and the proof by contraposition, we can infer that 'The wug was sproinged'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
