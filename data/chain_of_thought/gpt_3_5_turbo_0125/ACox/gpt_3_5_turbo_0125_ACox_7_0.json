It says that if the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer the following:\n- If the whiffle tinked, it could be because it was shanked (based on the second statement).\n- However, we cannot definitively conclude that the whiffle was shanked because the first statement does not provide direct information about the shanking of the whiffle.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The whiffle was shanked\" based on the given statements.",
