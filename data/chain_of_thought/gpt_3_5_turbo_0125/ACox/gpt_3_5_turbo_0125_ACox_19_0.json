It says that if the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\n\nFrom the given statements, we know that the twonk was varnished. However, we cannot directly infer that the twonk was plinked because the second statement only tells us that if the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished. It does not provide any information about whether the twonk was actually plinked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The twonk was plinked\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
