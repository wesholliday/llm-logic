It simply states that the fribble crinked.\n\n2. \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\" - This statement is a conditional statement. It says that if the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked. However, it does not provide any information about whether the fribble was actually snurgled or not.\n\nGiven the information provided, we cannot definitively infer that \"The fribble was snurgled\" because there is no direct statement confirming that the fribble was indeed snurgled. The conditional statement only tells us what would happen if the fribble was snurgled, but it does not confirm that it actually was.",
