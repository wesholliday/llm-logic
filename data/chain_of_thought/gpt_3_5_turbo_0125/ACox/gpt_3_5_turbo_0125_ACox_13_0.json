If the splat was morphed, then it was quanked. However, it does not provide information about whether the splat was actually morphed.\n\nCombining the two statements, we know that if the splat was morphed, then it was quanked. But we cannot definitively conclude that the splat was morphed based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The splat was morphed\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
