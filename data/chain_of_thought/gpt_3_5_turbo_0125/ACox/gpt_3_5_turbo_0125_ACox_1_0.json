It states that if the flugel was blimmed, then it was zargled.\n\nFrom the given statements, we know that the flugel was zargled. However, we cannot directly infer that the flugel was blimmed. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if the flugel was blimmed, not whether it was actually blimmed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the flugel was blimmed from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
