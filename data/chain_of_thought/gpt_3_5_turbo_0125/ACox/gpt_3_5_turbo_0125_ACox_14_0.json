However, it does not necessarily mean that the fribble was snurgled in the first place. The statement only tells us the consequence of the fribble being snurgled, not its initial state.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that the fribble was snurgled based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
