It tells us that if the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked. However, it does not tell us whether the splat was actually morphed or not.\n\nCombining the two statements, we know that if the splat was morphed, then it quanked. But we do not have any direct information that tells us whether the splat was actually morphed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The splat was morphed\" based on the given statements.",
