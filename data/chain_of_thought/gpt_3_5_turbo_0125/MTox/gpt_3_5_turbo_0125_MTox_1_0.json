From the statement \"The flugel was not zargled\" and \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled\", we can infer that if the flugel was zargled, then it must have been blimmed. This is because the second statement implies that blimming leads to zargling.\n\n2. If we know that the flugel was not zargled, then we can conclude that it was not blimmed either. This is because if blimming leads to zargling, and the flugel was not zargled, then it must not have been blimmed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
