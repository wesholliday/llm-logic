It states that if the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question. If the clug did not snugged and the conditional statement is true, it means the clug was not fleeked. This is because if the clug was fleeked, then it would have snugged according to the conditional statement. Therefore, we can infer that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
