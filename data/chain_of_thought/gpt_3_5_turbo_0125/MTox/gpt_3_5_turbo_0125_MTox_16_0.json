The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of statement 2 would be: \"If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
