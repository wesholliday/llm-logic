It means that if the whiffle was shanked, then it tinked.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer the following:\n- If the whiffle did not tink, it means that the condition \"the whiffle was shanked\" did not occur, because if it had been shanked, it would have tinked according to the second statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The whiffle was not shanked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
