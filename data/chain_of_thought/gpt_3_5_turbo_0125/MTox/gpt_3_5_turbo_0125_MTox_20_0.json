It says that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer the following:\n- Since the fleeg did not surn, it means that the condition \"it surned\" in the second statement was not met.\n- If the condition \"it surned\" was not met, it implies that the antecedent \"the fleeg was bluttered\" in the second statement was also not true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The fleeg was not bluttered'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
