The contrapositive of \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A.\"\n\nTherefore, if we take the contrapositive of statement 2, it becomes: \"If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped.\"\n\nGiven that the wug did not bim the zoint (from statement 1), we can infer that the wug was not flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
