It tells us that if the dreb was vroombed, then it was spened.\n\nNow, if we combine these two statements, we can infer the following:\n\n- Since the dreb was not spened, it means the condition \"the dreb was vroombed\" was not met because if it was vroombed, it would have been spened according to the second statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
