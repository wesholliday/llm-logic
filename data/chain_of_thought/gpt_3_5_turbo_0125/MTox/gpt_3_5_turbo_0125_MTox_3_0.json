This means that the splat did not exhibit the action of quanking.\n\nFrom statement 2, we have a conditional statement: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\" This means that if the splat was morphed, it would quank.\n\nNow, if we assume that the splat was morphed, then according to statement 2, it would quank. However, statement 1 tells us that the splat did not quank. This creates a contradiction if we assume the splat was morphed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
