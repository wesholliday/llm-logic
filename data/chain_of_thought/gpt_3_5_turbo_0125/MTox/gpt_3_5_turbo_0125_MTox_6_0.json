Statement 1: \"The grommet did not plop the frink.\"\n2. Statement 2: \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\"\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the grommet did not plop the frink. This means the grommet did not perform the action of plopping the frink.\n\nFrom statement 2, we have a conditional statement: \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\" This means that if the grommet was sploffed, then it plopped the frink. However, we know from statement 1 that the grommet did not plop the frink.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the grommet was not sploffed because if it had been sploffed, it would have plopped the frink according to statement 2, which contradicts the fact that the grommet did not plop the frink in statement 1.\n\nAnswer: yes",
