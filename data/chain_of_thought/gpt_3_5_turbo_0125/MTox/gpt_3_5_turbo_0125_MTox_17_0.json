It says that if the flob was skizzled, then it movated.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer the following:\n- If the flob did not movate, then it was not skizzled (contrapositive of the second statement).\n- Since the first statement tells us that the flob did not movate, we can conclude that the flob was not skizzled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The flob was not skizzled\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
