It says that if the fribble was snurgled, then it crinked.\n\nNow, if we combine these two statements, we can see that the fribble did not crink. This means that the condition in the second statement (\"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\") was not met, as the fribble did not crink. Therefore, we can infer that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
