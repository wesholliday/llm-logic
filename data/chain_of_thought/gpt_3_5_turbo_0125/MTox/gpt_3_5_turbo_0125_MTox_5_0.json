It says that if the zinger was fraggled, then it was smoogled.\n\nNow, if we assume that the zinger was fraggled, then according to the second statement, it would have been smoogled. But the first statement tells us that the zinger was not smoogled. This means our assumption that the zinger was fraggled leads to a contradiction with the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
