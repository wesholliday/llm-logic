It says that if the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\n\nFrom the given statements, we know that the twonk was not varnished. However, we cannot directly infer that the twonk was not plinked based on the information provided. The second statement only tells us what happens if the twonk was plinked, but it does not provide any information about whether the twonk was actually plinked or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The twonk was not plinked\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
