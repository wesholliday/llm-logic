It tells us that if the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer the following:\n- If the wug was not garpled, then it was not sproinged. This is because the second statement tells us that if the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled. Since the wug was not garpled, it cannot have been sproinged.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The wug was not sproinged' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
