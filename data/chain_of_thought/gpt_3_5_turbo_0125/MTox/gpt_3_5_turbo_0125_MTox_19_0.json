It says that if the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications:\n\n- If the smonk did not plagged, it means that the condition \"the smonk was vreebled\" did not occur, because if it did, the smonk would have plagged according to the second statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that 'The smonk was not vreebled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
