This can be represented as \u00acV \u2192 P.\n- From the second statement, we know that the twonk must not be plinked (\u00acP).\n\nCombining the information, we have:\n\u00acV \u2192 P\n\u00acP\n\nFrom the above, we can infer that the twonk must be varnished (V) because if it is not varnished (\u00acV), it would have to be plinked (P), which contradicts the fact that it is not plinked (\u00acP).\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The twonk is varnished.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
