The first statement is: \"Either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked.\"\n\nCombining the two statements, we have:\n- Either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked.\n- It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if the whiffle is not tinked, then it must be shanked. And from the second statement, we know that the whiffle is not tinked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The whiffle is shanked.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
