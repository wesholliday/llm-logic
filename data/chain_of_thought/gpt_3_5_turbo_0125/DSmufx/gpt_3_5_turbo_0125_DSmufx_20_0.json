(F \u2192 S) \u2228 B\n2. F \u2227 \u00acS (negation of F \u2192 S)\n\nFrom the second statement, we can infer \u00acS. Since the first statement states that either F implies S or B, and we know that F does not imply S, we can conclude that B must be true. Therefore, we can infer \"The fleeg is bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
