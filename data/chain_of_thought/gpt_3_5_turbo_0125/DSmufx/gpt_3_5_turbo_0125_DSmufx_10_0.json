From the second statement, we know that it's not the case that the wug must be garpled. This means that \\( \\neg A \\) is true.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that the wug is sproinged because if it's not garpled (\\( \\neg A \\)), then it must be sproinged (\\( B \\)) based on the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The wug is sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
