The first statement is: \"Either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the shank must be nugged.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked. From the second statement, we know that it is not the case that the shank must be nugged.\n\nTherefore, if it is not the case that the shank must be nugged, then the only remaining option from the first statement is that the shank is plooked.\n\nSo, based on the given statements, we can infer that 'The shank is plooked.'\n\nAnswer: yes",
