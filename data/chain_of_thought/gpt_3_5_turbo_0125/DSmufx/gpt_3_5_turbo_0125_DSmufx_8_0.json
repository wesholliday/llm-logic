The first statement is: \"Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked. Since the second statement tells us that it's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled, we can conclude that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer \"The sprocket is cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
