From the second statement, we have ~ZS.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that the zinger is fraggled (F) because if it's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled (~ZS) and the zinger must be either smoogled or fraggled (ZS or F), then the zinger must be fraggled.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer 'The zinger is fraggled' from the given statements. \n\nAnswer: yes",
