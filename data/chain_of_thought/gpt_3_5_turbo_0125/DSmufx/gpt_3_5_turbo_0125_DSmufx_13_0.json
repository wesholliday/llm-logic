It's not the case that the glip must be tragged.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the glip is not tragged, then it must be slogged. This is because the first statement states that one of the two conditions must be true.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that it's not the case that the glip must be tragged. This means that the glip is not tragged.\n\nCombining these two pieces of information, we can conclude that the glip is slogged.\n\nNow, based on this reasoning, can we infer 'The glip is slogged'? Answer:  yes",
