The first statement is: \"Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the flob must be movated.\"\n\nCombining the two statements:\n- If it's not the case that the flob must be movated, then the first statement simplifies to \"The flob is skizzled.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The flob is skizzled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
