The first statement is: \"Either the fribble must be crinked or it is snurgled.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that either the fribble must be crinked or it is snurgled. Since the second statement tells us that it is not the case that the fribble must be crinked, we can conclude that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The fribble is snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
