The first statement is: \"Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled. From the second statement, we know that it is not the case that the smonk must be plagged.\n\nSince it is not the case that the smonk must be plagged, the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that the smonk is vreebled. Therefore, we can infer that \"The smonk is vreebled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
