(C \u2192 S) \u2228 F\n2. \u00ac(C \u2192 S) or \u00acC \u2228 S\n\nFrom the second statement, we can infer \u00ac(C \u2192 S) which simplifies to \u00ac(\u00acC \u2228 S) which further simplifies to C \u2227 \u00acS.\n\nNow, combining the first and the simplified second statement:\n\n1. (C \u2192 S) \u2228 F\n2. C \u2227 \u00acS\n\nFrom the above, we can infer that the clug must be snugged (C \u2192 S) and it is not fleeked (\u00acF). Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The clug is fleeked' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
