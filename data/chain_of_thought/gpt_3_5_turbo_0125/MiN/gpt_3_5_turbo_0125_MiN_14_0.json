It leaves room for uncertainty.\n\nOn the other hand, \"It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter\" implies that it is not necessary for the milk to be on the counter, which is a stronger statement than the original one.\n\nTherefore, we cannot directly infer the second statement from the first without additional information. \n\nAnswer: no",
