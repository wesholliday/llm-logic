It does not definitively state whether she bought it or not.\n\nNow, let's analyze the second statement:\n\n\"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\"\n\nThis statement negates the idea that Lisa is required to have bought the red shirt. It does not definitively state whether she bought it or not, similar to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the meanings of the two statements, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
