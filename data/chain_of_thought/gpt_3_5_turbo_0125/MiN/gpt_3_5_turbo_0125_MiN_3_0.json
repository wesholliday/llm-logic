The first statement \"The book might not have been written by James\" suggests that there is a possibility that James did not write the book. This does not necessarily mean that James definitely did not write the book. \n\nThe second statement \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James\" implies that it is not a requirement or necessity for the book to have been written by James. This aligns with the first statement as it allows for the possibility that someone other than James could have written the book.\n\nTherefore, based on the meanings of the two statements, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
