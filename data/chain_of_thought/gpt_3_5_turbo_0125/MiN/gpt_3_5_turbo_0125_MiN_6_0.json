This means that pizza is not the only option and Sue could have chosen something else.\n\n\"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" implies that Sue is not required or obligated to choose pizza. This statement does not necessarily mean that Sue did not choose pizza; it simply states that choosing pizza is not a requirement.\n\nGiven these interpretations, we can infer that \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" from \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" because the possibility of Sue choosing something other than pizza does not imply that she must have chosen pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
