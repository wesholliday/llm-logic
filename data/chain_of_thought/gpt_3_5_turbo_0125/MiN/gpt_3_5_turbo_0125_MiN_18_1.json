It leaves room for uncertainty.\n- When we consider the second statement, \"It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer,\" it suggests that it is not necessary for the notebook to be in the drawer. This statement allows for the possibility that the notebook could be elsewhere, but it does not definitively assert that it is not in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, both statements leave open the possibility that the notebook may or may not be in the drawer, but they do not definitively confirm or deny the notebook's presence in the drawer.",
