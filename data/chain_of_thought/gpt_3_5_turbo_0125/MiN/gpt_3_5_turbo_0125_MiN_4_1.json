It leaves room for uncertainty about whether or not the alien visited Mars.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars\": This statement negates the idea that it is necessary or certain that the alien visited Mars. It implies that there is no obligation or requirement that the alien visited Mars.\n\nGiven these explanations, we can infer the second statement from the first because if the alien \"might not have visited Mars,\" it does not necessarily mean that the scenario \"the alien must have visited Mars\" is true.
