The original statement says the scarf might not be stuffed in the backpack, which means there is a possibility that it is not there. So, the inferred statement would be that it is not required to be there, meaning it's not necessary or obligated to be in the backpack.\n\nTherefore, given that there is a possibility the scarf is not in the backpack, we can infer that it is not necessarily the case that the scarf must be stuffed in the backpack. \n\nAnswer: yes",
