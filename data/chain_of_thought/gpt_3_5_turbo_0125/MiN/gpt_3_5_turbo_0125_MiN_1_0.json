The first statement \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" suggests that there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding. The second statement \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" implies that it is not necessary for Mary to have been at the wedding, which aligns with the idea that there is a possibility she was not there. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
