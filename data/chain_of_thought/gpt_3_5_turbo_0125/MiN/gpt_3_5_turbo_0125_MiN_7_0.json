This does not definitively state that Alex did not finish the race, only that there is a chance that he did not.\n\nOn the other hand, \"It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race\" implies that it is not necessary or obligatory for Alex to have finished the race. This statement does not directly contradict the original statement, as it aligns with the idea that there is a possibility that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nTherefore, based on the meanings of the two statements, we can infer \"It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race\" from \"Alex might not have finished the race.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
