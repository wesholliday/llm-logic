This implies that it is not certain whether Lisa bought the red shirt.\n- The second statement 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt' expresses a negation of the idea that Lisa is required to have bought the red shirt. This aligns with the uncertainty presented in the original statement.\n\nConsidering this, if Lisa 'might not have' bought the red shirt, it is indeed correct to say 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt', as there is no definite confirmation of her purchasing the red shirt in the original statement.\n\nTherefore, the second statement can be inferred from the first one.\n\nAnswer: yes",

This possibility suggests that Lisa could have bought the red shirt, but it is also possible that she did not.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" suggests that it is not a requirement for Lisa to have bought the red shirt.
