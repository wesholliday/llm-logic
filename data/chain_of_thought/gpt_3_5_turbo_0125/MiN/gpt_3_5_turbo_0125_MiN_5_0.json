This does not necessarily mean that he definitely did not play basketball.\n\nThe second statement, \"It's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball,\" means that it is not necessary for Jeff to have played basketball. This statement does not directly contradict the original statement because the original statement allows for the possibility that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
