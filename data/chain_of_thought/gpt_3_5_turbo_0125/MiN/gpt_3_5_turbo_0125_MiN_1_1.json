            "content": "First, let's examine the original statement \"Mary might not have been at the wedding.\"\n\nThis statement suggests that there is a chance that Mary was not at the wedding but does not definitively state that she was absent. It leaves room for the possibility that she may or may not have been there.\n\nThe inference \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" suggests that it is not necessary or required for Mary to have been at the wedding. This implies that her presence is not obligatory or certain.\n\nGiven the original statement and the inference in question, we can see that they are not direct opposites. The original statement allows for the possibility that Mary was not at the wedding, while the inference suggests that it is not necessary for her to have been there. Therefore, we cannot directly infer the second statement from the first without further information.\n\nAnswer: no",
