So, it can be expressed as: (T -> ~S) V (S).\n\n2. \"The glip might not be tragged.\" This statement suggests that the glip being tragged is not a certainty. So, it can be expressed as: ~(T).\n\nNow, let's consider the combination of both premises:\n\n- From \"The glip might not be tragged\" (~~T -> T), and the first premise \"(T -> ~S) V (S),\" we see that there is a possibility that the glip is slogged, since if the glip is not tragged, it must be slogged according to the first premise. \n\nCombining these two statements, we cannot definitively infer that \"The glip is slogged\" because there is still a possibility that the glip is not tragged. The information provided is not sufficient to make a definite conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
