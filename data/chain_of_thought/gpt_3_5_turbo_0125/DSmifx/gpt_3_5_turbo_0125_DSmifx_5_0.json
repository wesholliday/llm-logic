This means that at least one of these conditions must be true.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that it is possible that the zinger is not smoogled.\n\nIf the zinger is not smoogled, then according to statement 1, it must be fraggled. This is because one of the conditions in statement 1 must be true, and if the zinger is not smoogled, then it must be fraggled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The zinger is fraggled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
