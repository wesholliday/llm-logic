This is because the statement says that either the splat is quanked or it is morphed, meaning one of these two conditions must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the splat might not be quanked, which means it could be morphed according to statement 1.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The splat is morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
