The first statement is: \"Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed.\"\n   - This statement can be represented as: F \u2192 Z \u2228 B\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The flugel might not be zargled.\"\n   - This statement can be represented as: \u00acZ\n\n3. We want to infer: \"The flugel is blimmed.\"\n   - This statement can be represented as: B\n\nNow, let's analyze the given information:\n\n- From the first statement (F \u2192 Z \u2228 B) and the fact that \u00acZ, we can infer \u00acF (the flugel is not zargled).\n- Since the flugel is not zargled (\u00acZ) and the first statement states that either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed (F \u2192 Z \u2228 B), we can conclude that the flugel is blimmed (B).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and the logical deductions made, we can infer \"The flugel is blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
