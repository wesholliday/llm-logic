This is because if it is not crinked, and it must be one of the two options, then it has to be the other option, which is snurgled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The fribble is snurgled\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",

This implies a mutually exclusive relationship between crinked and snurgled.\n\n2. \"The fribble might not be crinked.\"\n   This statement presents a possibility that the fribble is not crinked but does not provide certainty.\n\nGiven the first statement, we know that if the fribble is not crinked, it must be snurgled according to the conditions established. Since the possibility exists that the fribble is not crinked, and in that case, it would be snurgled, we can indeed infer that \"The fribble is snurgled.\"\n\nTherefore, the statement \"The fribble is snurgled\" can be logically inferred from the provided information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
