If the sprocket is not daggled, then it must be cranked according to the first statement.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the sprocket might not be daggled, which aligns with the first statement's condition that if it is not daggled, it is cranked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
