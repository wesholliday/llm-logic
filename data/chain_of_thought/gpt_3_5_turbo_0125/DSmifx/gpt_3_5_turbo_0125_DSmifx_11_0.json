The first statement is: \"Either the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"The flug might not be zimmed.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the flug must be either zimmed or blummed. If it's not zimmed, then it must be blummed according to the first statement.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the flug might not be zimmed, which means zimming is not certain.\n\nCombining the two statements, we can infer that if the flug is not zimmed (as indicated in the second statement), then it must be blummed (as per the first statement).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The flug is blummed'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
