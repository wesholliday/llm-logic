This means that one of these two conditions must be true.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that it is possible that the wug is not bimmed. This means that the wug could be flooped.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that the wug could be flooped, but we cannot definitively conclude that the wug is flooped.\n\nAnswer: no",
