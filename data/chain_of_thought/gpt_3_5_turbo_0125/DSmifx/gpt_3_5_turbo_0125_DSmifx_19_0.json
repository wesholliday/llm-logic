From the second statement, we know that the smonk might not be plagged, which can be represented as not plagged (~P).\n\nGiven these statements, we cannot directly infer that \"The smonk is vreebled\" because the information provided does not definitively state that the smonk is vreebled. The possibility remains that the smonk is not plagged (~P) but it is not necessarily vreebled either.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The smonk is vreebled\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
