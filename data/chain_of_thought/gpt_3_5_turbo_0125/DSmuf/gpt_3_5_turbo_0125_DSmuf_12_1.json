The second statement can then be translated as \"not P\". Since the first statement is a disjunction ('or' statement) and one of the disjuncts is negated in the second statement, we can use the rule of logical inference called Modus Tollens which states: \"If P implies Q and not Q is true, then not P must be true.\"\n\nTherefore, from the premises given, we can infer \"The jacket is draped over the chair\" using Modus Tollens.",
