The first statement is: \"Either the newspaper must be sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch.\"\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that if the newspaper is not on the porch, then it must be in the driveway. This is because the first statement tells us that the newspaper must be in one of the two locations (porch or driveway), and the second statement rules out the possibility of it being on the porch.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that \"The newspaper is in the driveway.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
