Since statement 2 tells us that it's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry, it implies that the cookies are not in the pantry. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can infer that \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
