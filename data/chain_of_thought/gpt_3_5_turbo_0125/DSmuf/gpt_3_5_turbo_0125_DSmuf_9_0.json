The first statement is: \"Either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\"\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that if it's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor, then it must be in the box. This is because the first statement states that the missing puzzle piece is either on the floor or in the box, and the second statement rules out the possibility of it being on the floor.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
