The first statement is: 'Either the cat must be playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch.'\n2. The second statement is: 'It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom.'\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that if it's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom, then the cat must be napping on the couch. This is because the first statement implies that the cat is either playing in the bedroom or napping on the couch, and the second statement rules out the possibility of the cat playing in the bedroom.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The cat is napping on the couch' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
