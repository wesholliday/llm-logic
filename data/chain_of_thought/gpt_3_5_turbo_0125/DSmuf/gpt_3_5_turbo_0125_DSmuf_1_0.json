The first statement is \"Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside.\" This can be represented as: (Fido in garden) OR (Fido inside).\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" This can be represented as: NOT (Fido in garden).\n\n3. Combining the first and second statements, we have: (NOT (Fido in garden)) OR (Fido inside).\n\n4. From the above, we can see that if Fido is not in the garden, then Fido must be inside.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that 'Fido is inside'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
