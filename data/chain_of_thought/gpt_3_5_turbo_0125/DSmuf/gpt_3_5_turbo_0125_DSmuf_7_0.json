The first statement is: \"Either the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet or it is in the car.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\"\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that if it's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet, then the only remaining option from the first statement is that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that 'The umbrella is in the car'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
