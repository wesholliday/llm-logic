The first statement is: \"Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that if it's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge, then the milk must be on the counter. This is because the first statement tells us that the milk must be either in the fridge or on the counter, and the second statement rules out the possibility of the milk being in the fridge.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
