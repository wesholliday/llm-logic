The first statement is: 'Either the phone must be ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room.'\n2. The second statement is: 'It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen.'\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that if it's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen, then the phone must be in the living room. This is because the first statement tells us that the phone is either in the kitchen or the living room, and the second statement rules out the possibility of it being in the kitchen.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The phone is in the living room'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
