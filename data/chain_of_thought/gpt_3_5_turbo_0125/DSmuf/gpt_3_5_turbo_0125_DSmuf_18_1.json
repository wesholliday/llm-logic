The part A \u2227 \u00acA is always false (since A and \u00acA cannot both be true), so we are left with: B \u2227 \u00acA which translates to \"The notebook is in the drawer and it's not on the nightstand.\"\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that \"The notebook is in the drawer.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
