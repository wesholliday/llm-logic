The statement \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk\" can be represented as: \u00acP (not P).\n3. From the first statement, we know that either the pen is on the desk or in the bag, but not necessarily both.\n4. From the second statement, we know that it is not the case that the pen must be on the desk, which means it could be in the bag.\n5. Combining the two statements, we can infer that the pen is in the bag because it is not on the desk.\n\nTherefore, the inference that \"The pen is in my bag\" can be made based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
