The first statement is: \"Either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that the notebook is not on the nightstand. However, this does not necessarily mean that the notebook is in the drawer. It could be somewhere else entirely.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The notebook is in the drawer\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
