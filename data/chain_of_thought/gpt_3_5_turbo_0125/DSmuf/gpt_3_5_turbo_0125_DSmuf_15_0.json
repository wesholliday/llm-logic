The first statement is: 'Either the shoes must be lined up by the door or they are in the closet.'\n2. The second statement is: 'It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door.'\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer the following:\n- If it's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door, then the shoes are not lined up by the door.\n- Since the first statement says that the shoes must either be lined up by the door or in the closet, and we know they are not lined up by the door, then they must be in the closet.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that 'The shoes are in the closet.'\n\nAnswer: yes",
