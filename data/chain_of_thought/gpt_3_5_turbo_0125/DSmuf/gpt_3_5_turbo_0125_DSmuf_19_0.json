This means that the watch is not on his wrist.\n\nTherefore, if the watch is not on his wrist, based on statement 1, the only remaining option is that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nNow, let's put it all together:\n\n- The watch must be either on his wrist or charging on the dresser.\n- It is not on his wrist.\n- Therefore, the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
