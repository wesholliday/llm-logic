If we represent the two possibilities as A (sunglasses are perched on her head) and B (sunglasses are in her bag), the statement could be written as A v B (A or B).\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\":\n   - This can be denoted as \u00acA, meaning the sunglasses are not perched on her head.\n\nGiven the above, we have:\n- A v B (Either sunglasses are perched on her head or they are in her bag)\n- \u00acA (Sunglasses are not perched on her head)\n\nNow, if the sunglasses are not perched on her head (\u00acA), we can deduce that the first condition (A) from the disjunction must be false.
