It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\n\nConsidering the first statement, it presents two options: the umbrella is in the closet or in the car.

Therefore, we can infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nSo, to answer the question, 'The umbrella is in the car':\nAnswer: yes",
