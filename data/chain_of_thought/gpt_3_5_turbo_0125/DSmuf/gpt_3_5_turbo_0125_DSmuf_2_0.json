The first statement is: \"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that if it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table, then the book must be on the shelf. This is because the first statement tells us that the book must be either on the table or on the shelf, and the second statement rules out the possibility of the book being on the table. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nSo, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
