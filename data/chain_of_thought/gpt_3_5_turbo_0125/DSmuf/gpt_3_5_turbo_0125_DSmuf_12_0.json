From the second statement, we know that it's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\n\nIf it's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet (\u00acA), then the only option left from the first statement is that the jacket is draped over the chair (B).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The jacket is draped over the chair'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
