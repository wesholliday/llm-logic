Then, we are given the statement \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\" This is a conditional statement where the antecedent is \"the alien visited Mars\" and the consequent is \"the robot visited Jupiter.\" \n\nGiven that the robot visited Jupiter, according to the conditional statement, it implies that the antecedent \"the alien visited Mars\" must be true in order for the consequent to be true. Therefore, we can infer that the alien visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
