From statement 2, we know that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. However, we cannot directly infer that the vampire was awake based on the given information. It is possible that the mummy was awake for another reason, not necessarily because the vampire was awake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that the vampire was awake based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
