It states that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nFrom the given statements, we know that the banana was yellow. However, we cannot definitively conclude the color of the apple based on the information provided. The second statement only tells us what would happen if the apple was red, but it does not provide any information about the actual color of the apple.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The apple was red\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
