This means that whenever the cake is chocolate, the muffins are blueberry.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively conclude that the cake was chocolate based on the given information. The statement only tells us what happens if the cake is chocolate, not what actually happened in this specific scenario.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The cake was chocolate\" based on the given information.",
