From the second statement, we have a conditional statement: if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer that the book was written by James from the given statements. The second statement only tells us that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. It does not tell us anything about the authorship of the book.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the book was written by James based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
