The second statement is \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\"\n\nFrom the second statement, we can infer that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. However, this does not necessarily mean that Jeff actually played basketball. It only tells us that if Jeff did play basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that Jeff played basketball from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
