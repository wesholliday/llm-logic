Then, we are given the statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This can be rewritten as a conditional statement: \"If car is red, then truck is blue.\" \n\nFrom these two pieces of information, we can infer that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. However, we cannot definitively conclude that the car was red based on the given information. The statement only tells us what would happen if the car was red, not that the car was actually red.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the car was red based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
