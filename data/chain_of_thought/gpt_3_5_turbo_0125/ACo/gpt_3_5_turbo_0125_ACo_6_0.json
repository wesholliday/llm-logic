If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that Bob chose pasta. From the second statement, we are given a conditional statement: If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. This means that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob definitely chose pasta.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively infer that Sue chose pizza based on the given information. It is possible that Sue did not choose pizza, which would still satisfy the condition that Bob chose pasta.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Sue chose pizza based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
