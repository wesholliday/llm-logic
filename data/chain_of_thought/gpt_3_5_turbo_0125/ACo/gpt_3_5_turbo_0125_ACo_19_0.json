If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that Jen watched basketball. From statement 2, we can infer that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. However, this does not necessarily mean that Tom watched football. It only tells us that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. Tom could have watched football or not watched football, and both scenarios would be consistent with the given statements.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that Tom watched football based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
