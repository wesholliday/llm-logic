It states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that if Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe must have gone to the park. This is because the second statement establishes a relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo. If Lucy went to the zoo, it must be because Joe went to the park.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Joe went to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
