The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nGiven:\n1. If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. (A -> B)\n2. The robot did not visit Jupiter. (not B)\n\nFrom statement 1, we can write the contrapositive:\n- If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars. (not B -> not A)\n\nSince statement 2 states that the robot did not visit Jupiter (not B), we can infer from the contrapositive that the alien did not visit Mars (not A).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The alien did not visit Mars' from the given statements.",
