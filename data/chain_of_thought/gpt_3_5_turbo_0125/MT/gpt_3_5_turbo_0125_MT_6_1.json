            "content": "To determine whether we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza based on the given information, we should first understand the implication of the statements:\n\n1. The statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" implies that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\n2. The statement \"Bob did not choose pasta\" tells us that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nSince the first statement tells us that if Sue chose pizza, Bob must have chosen pasta, and the second statement tells us Bob did not choose pasta, it follows that Sue did not choose pizza. This inference is valid because if Sue had chosen pizza as per the first statement, Bob would have been required to choose pasta, which contradicts the second statement. Therefore, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes",

It states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. This does not provide any information on what happens if Sue did not choose pizza.\n\n2. \"Bob did not choose pasta\" is a given statement, indicating that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can deduce the following scenarios:\n- If Sue chose pizza, Bob chose pasta. However, since Bob did not choose pasta (as given), we can conclude that Sue did not choose pizza, as the given condition was not met.\n- If Sue did not choose pizza, we have no information about what Bob chose.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",

This means that \"Bob did not choose pasta\" indicates that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nNow, considering the original conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" or \\( P \\Rightarrow Q \\), and we know that \"Bob did not choose pasta\" or \\( \\neg Q \\), we cannot automatically infer that 'Sue did not choose pizza' directly.\n\nThe reason for this is that the conditional statement does not enforce the inverse relationship. That is, just because Bob did not choose pasta, it does not necessarily mean that Sue did not choose pizza. Sue could have chosen something other than pizza that is not inconsistent with Bob not choosing pasta.\n\nTherefore, from the given information alone, we cannot definitively say that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: no",
