The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nGiven:\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. (A -> B)\n2. The book is not a mystery novel. (not B)\n\nFrom statement 1, we can derive the contrapositive: If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James. (not B -> not A)\n\nTherefore, based on the contrapositive and the given statements, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
