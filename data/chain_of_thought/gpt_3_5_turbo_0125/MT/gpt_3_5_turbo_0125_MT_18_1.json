If the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. Symbolically, this can be represented as: Doll (Plastic) -> Truck (Metal).\n\n2. \"The truck was not metal\": This statement directly tells us that the truck was not metal.\n\nGiven these two statements, if we consider that the condition in the first statement is false (the doll was not plastic), then we wouldn't be able to deduce anything about the truck based on the information we have. This is because the conditional relationship only tells us what happens if the doll was plastic. So, without knowing the material of the doll, we cannot definitively determine the material of the truck.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer conclusively that 'The doll was not plastic'.\n\nAnswer: no",
