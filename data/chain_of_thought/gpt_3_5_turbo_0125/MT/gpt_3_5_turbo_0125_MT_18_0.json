            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'The doll was not plastic' from the given statements, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" - This is a conditional statement. It means that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. However, it does not tell us anything about the doll if the truck is not metal.\n\n2. \"The truck was not metal\" - This statement tells us that the truck was not metal.\n\nCombining the two statements:\n- If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n- The truck was not metal.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot directly infer that the doll was not plastic. The first statement only tells us about the relationship between the doll being plastic and the truck being metal. It does not provide any information about the doll if the truck is not metal.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The doll was not plastic' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
