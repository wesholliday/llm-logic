It does not provide any information about the bear's location when the wolf is not in the den.\n\n2. \"The wolf was not in the den\" - This statement directly tells us that the wolf was not in the den.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively infer that \"The bear was not in the cave.\" The first statement only establishes a relationship between the bear being in the cave and the wolf being in the den. It does not provide information about the bear's location when the wolf is not in the den. Therefore, we cannot make a conclusive inference about the bear's location based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
