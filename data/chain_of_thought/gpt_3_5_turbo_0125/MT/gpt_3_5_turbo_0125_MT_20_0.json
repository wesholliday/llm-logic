The first statement is: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"The banana was not yellow.\"\n\nGiven these statements, we can analyze them as follows:\n\n- If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. This statement implies a conditional relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana. If the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow.\n- The second statement tells us that the banana was not yellow. This means that the condition required for the first statement to hold true (the banana being yellow) is not met.\n\nTherefore, since the condition for the first statement to be true is not met (the banana being yellow), we cannot definitively infer the color of the apple from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
