The first statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" can be translated as: Mary -> Sue. The contrapositive of this statement would be: not Sue -> not Mary, stating that if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nGiven the second statement \"Sue was not at the wedding\" directly implies that Sue was indeed not at the wedding, it aligns with the contrapositive of the first statement. Therefore, we can conclude that Mary was not at the wedding based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
