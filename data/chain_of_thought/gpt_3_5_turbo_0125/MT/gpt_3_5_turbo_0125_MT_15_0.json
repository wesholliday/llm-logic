The first statement is: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"Erin did not take a train.\"\n\nFrom these statements, we know that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. Since Erin did not take a train, we can conclude that Sam did not take a plane. This is because the first statement establishes a conditional relationship between Sam taking a plane and Erin taking a train. If the condition (Erin taking a train) is not met, then the consequent (Sam taking a plane) cannot be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that 'Sam did not take a plane'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
