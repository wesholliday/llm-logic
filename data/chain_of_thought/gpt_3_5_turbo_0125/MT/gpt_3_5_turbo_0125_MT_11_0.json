If the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry.\n\n2. \"The muffins were not blueberry\" - This statement tells us that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nFrom the given statements, we know that the muffins were not blueberry. This means that the condition for the first statement (\"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\") was not met. Since the muffins were not blueberry, we can conclude that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The cake was not chocolate'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
