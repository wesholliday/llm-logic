The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" \n\nGiven the original statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo,\" the contrapositive would be \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\nSince we are also given the information that Lucy did not go to the zoo, we can apply the contrapositive to conclude that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nTherefore, the inference that Joe did not go to the park is valid based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
