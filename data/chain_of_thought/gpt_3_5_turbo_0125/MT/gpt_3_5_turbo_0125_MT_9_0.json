The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" can be represented as: \n   - If L (Lisa bought the red shirt), then M (Mark bought the blue shirt).\n\n2. The statement \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" can be represented as: \n   - Not M (Mark did not buy the blue shirt).\n\n3. From the above two statements, we can infer the contrapositive of the first statement:\n   - If Not M (Mark did not buy the blue shirt), then Not L (Lisa did not buy the red shirt).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and the contrapositive inference, we can conclude that 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
