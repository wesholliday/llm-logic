If the car is red, then the truck is blue. However, it does not provide any information about the color of the car if the truck is not blue.\n\n2. \"The truck was not blue\" - This statement directly tells us that the truck was not blue.\n\nCombining the two statements:\n- If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n- The truck was not blue.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the truck was not blue. This means that the antecedent of the conditional statement in the first statement is false (the truck was not blue). In logic, when the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the truth value of the statement as a whole is considered true, regardless of the consequent.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The car was not red\" from the given statements.",
