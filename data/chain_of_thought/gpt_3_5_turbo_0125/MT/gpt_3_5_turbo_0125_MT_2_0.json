However, since the second statement tells us that the unicorn was not in the forest, we can conclude that the griffin was not in the forest. This is because the first statement establishes a conditional relationship between the griffin and the unicorn, and the absence of the unicorn in the forest implies the absence of the griffin as well.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
