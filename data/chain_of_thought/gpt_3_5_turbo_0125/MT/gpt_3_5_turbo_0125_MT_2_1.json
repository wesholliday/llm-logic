From the statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest,\" we know that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn must also be in the forest. This is expressed as a conditional statement: If P (griffin in forest), then Q (unicorn in forest).\n\n2. The second statement tells us that \"The unicorn was not in the forest,\" which translates to not Q (not unicorn in forest).\n\n3. Because of the contrapositive of the first statement (If not Q, then not P), we can infer that if the unicorn was not in the forest (not Q), then the griffin was also not in the forest (not P).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the griffin was not in the forest based on the given statements. \n\nAnswer: yes",
