The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This can be represented as: A -> C.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"Chris did not finish the race.\" This can be represented as: ~C.\n\nTo infer that Alex did not finish the race, we would need to show that if Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race. This would be the contrapositive of the original conditional statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of A -> C is ~C -> ~A.\n\nTherefore, if we can show that ~C is true, then we can infer ~A.\n\nNow, let's see if we can infer 'Alex did not finish the race' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
