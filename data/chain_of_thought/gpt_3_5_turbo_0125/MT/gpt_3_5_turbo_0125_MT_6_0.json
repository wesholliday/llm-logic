The statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" can be represented as: Sue chose pizza -> Bob chose pasta.\n2. The statement \"Bob did not choose pasta\" can be represented as: ~Bob chose pasta.\n\nNow, if we combine these two statements, we get:\n~Bob chose pasta -> ~Sue chose pizza.\n\nThis means that if Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza. Therefore, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
