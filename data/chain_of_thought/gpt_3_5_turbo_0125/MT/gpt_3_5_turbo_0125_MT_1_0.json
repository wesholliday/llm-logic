The contrapositive of \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A.\" \n\nGiven:\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n2. Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can write the contrapositive as:\n- If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nGiven statement 2 that Sue was not at the wedding, according to the contrapositive, Mary was not at the wedding. \n\nTherefore, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
