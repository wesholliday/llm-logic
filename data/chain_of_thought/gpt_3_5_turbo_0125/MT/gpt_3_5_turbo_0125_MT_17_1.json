The first premise states that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad. This can be written symbolically as: A -> B, where A represents Ben eating pasta and B represents Kate eating salad.\n2. The second premise states that Kate did not eat salad, which gives us ~B, where ~ represents 'not'.\n3. If we know that B is false (Kate did not eat the salad), then the truth value of A -> B is irrelevant because false -> anything is true. In formal logic, the only time a conditional statement A -> B is false is when A is true and B is false. If B is false, then the truth value of A is irrelevant for the truth value of the entire statement.\n4.
