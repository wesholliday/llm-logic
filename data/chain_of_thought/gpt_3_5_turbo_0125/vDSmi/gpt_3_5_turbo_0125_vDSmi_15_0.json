The first premise states: 'Either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door'.\n2. The second premise states: 'The shoes might not be lined up by the door'.\n\nGiven these premises, if we assume that the first premise is true (which states that the shoes are either in the closet or lined up by the door), and the second premise is also true (which states that the shoes might not be lined up by the door), then the only remaining possibility is that the shoes are in the closet. Therefore, the conclusion 'The shoes are in the closet' logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
