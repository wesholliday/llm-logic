The first premise states: 'Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed'. This is a disjunction (OR) statement, which means at least one of the options must be true.\n\n2. The second premise states: 'The missing sock might not be under the bed'. This implies that the missing sock could be in the laundry basket.\n\n3. If we combine the information from the premises, we can see that if the missing sock is not under the bed (as stated in the second premise) and the first premise is true (which states that the missing sock must be either in the laundry basket or under the bed), then the missing sock must be in the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
