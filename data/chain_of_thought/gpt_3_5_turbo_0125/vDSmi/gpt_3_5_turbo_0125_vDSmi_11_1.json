The first premise states that either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch. This can be represented as (D \u22c1 P), where D stands for \"the newspaper is in the driveway\" and P stands for \"the newspaper is sitting on the porch\".\n\n2. The second premise says that the newspaper might not be sitting on the porch, which can be represented as \u00acP.\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is that \"The newspaper is in the driveway\", represented as D.\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\n- If we know that either the newspaper is in the driveway (D) or it must be sitting on the porch (P), and we know that the newspaper might not be sitting on the porch (\u00acP), then we can infer that the newspaper is in the driveway (D).\n\nTherefore, based on the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
