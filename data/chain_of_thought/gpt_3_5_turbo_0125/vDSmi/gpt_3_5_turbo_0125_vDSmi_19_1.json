In disjunctive syllogism, if we have a disjunction (either/or statement) and one of the options is proven false, then the other option must be true. \n\nIn this case: \n1. Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\n2. The watch might not be on his wrist.\n\nFrom premise 1, we have two options: \n- The watch is charging on the dresser\n- The watch is on his wrist\n\nHowever, premise 2 states that the watch might not be on his wrist, which eliminates one option. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\nBy applying the logic of disjunctive syllogism, we can say that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
