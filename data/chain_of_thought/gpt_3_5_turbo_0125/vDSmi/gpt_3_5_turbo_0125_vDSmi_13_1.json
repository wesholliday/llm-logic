The first premise is 'Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the shelf'. This can be written as: (T \u2192 B) \u2228 (\u00acB \u2192 T), where T stands for \"the toy is in the toy box\" and B stands for \"the toy must be sitting on the shelf\".\n\n2. The second premise is 'The toy might not be sitting on the shelf'. This can be written as: \u00acB.\n\n3. If we assume the second premise is true and combine it with the first premise, we get: (T \u2192 B) \u2228 (\u00ac\u00acB \u2192 T). Applying double negation, this simplifies to: (T \u2192 B) \u2228 (B \u2192 T).\n\n4. By applying material implication, we can further simplify the statement to: (\u00acT \u2228 B) \u2228 (\u00acB \u2228 T). This can be rewritten as: \u00acT \u2228 B \u2228 \u00acB \u2228 T. By the law of excluded middle (A \u2228 \u00acA is always true), this is a tautology regardless of the truth values of T and B.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
