Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\n2. The watch might not be on his wrist.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if the watch is not on his wrist, then it must be charging on the dresser. Premise 2 states that the watch might not be on his wrist, which means it could be somewhere else. Since the only other option given in premise 1 is that it is charging on the dresser, we can conclude that the watch is indeed charging on the dresser.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
