The first premise states: 'Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom'. This is a disjunction (OR) statement, which means at least one of the options must be true.\n\n2. The second premise states: 'The cat might not be playing in the bedroom'. This suggests that the cat may not be playing in the bedroom, leaving the possibility that it is napping on the couch.\n\n3. If we combine the information from the premises, we can see that if the cat is not playing in the bedroom (as stated in the second premise) and the first premise says that the cat must be either napping on the couch or playing in the bedroom, then the only option left is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
