Disjunctive syllogism states that if either one of two options must be true and one of them is shown to be false, then the other option must be true. In this case, the argument presents the disjunction \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed\", and the second premise \"The missing sock might not be under the bed\" negates the possibility of the sock being under the bed.
