The first premise states: 'Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack'.\n2. The second premise states: 'The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack'.\n3. From the first premise, we can infer that if the scarf is not stuffed in the backpack, then it must be draped on the coat rack.\n4. The second premise tells us that the scarf might not be draped on the coat rack, which means it is not necessarily on the coat rack.\n5. Combining the information from both premises, we can conclude that the scarf must be stuffed in the backpack because it is not on the coat rack.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
