It says that if the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer the following:\n\n- If the grommet did not sploff, then the condition in the second statement (\"If the grommet was sploffed\") is not met. Therefore, we cannot conclude anything about whether the grommet plopped the frink or not.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot directly infer that \"The grommet did not plop the frink.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
