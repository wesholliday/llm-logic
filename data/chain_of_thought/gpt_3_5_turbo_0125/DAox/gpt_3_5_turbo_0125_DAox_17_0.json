It says that if the flob was skizzled, then it movated.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer the following:\n- If the flob was skizzled, then it movated.\n- Since the flob was not skizzled (from the first statement), we cannot definitively say whether the flob movated or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The flob was not movated\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
