It says that if the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer the following:\n- If the splat was not morphed, then we cannot determine whether the splat quanked or not because the second statement only talks about what happens if the splat was morphed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot directly infer 'The splat did not quank' from the given statements. \n\nAnswer: no",
