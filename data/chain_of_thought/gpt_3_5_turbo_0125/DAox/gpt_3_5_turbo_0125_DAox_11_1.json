It states that if the flug was blummed, then it was also zimmed. This does not provide any information about the actual state of being zimmed.\n\nGiven the information provided, we cannot directly infer that \"The flug was not zimmed\" based on the two statements.

However, we are given that the flug was not blummed. Since the first statement rules out the possibility of the flug being blummed, it indicates that the consequent part of the conditional statement (being zimmed) becomes irrelevant as the antecedent condition (being blummed) is not met.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The flug was not zimmed\" based on the given statements.",
