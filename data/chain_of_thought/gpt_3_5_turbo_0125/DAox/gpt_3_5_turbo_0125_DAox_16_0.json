It says that if the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer the following:\n- If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\n- Since the sneg was not crampled (from the first statement), we cannot definitively say whether the sneg sproted the frink or not. The second statement only tells us what happens if the sneg was crampled, but it does not provide information about what happens if the sneg was not crampled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The sneg did not sprot the frink\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
