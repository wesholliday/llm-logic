It tells us that if the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications:\n\n- If the fribble was not snurgled (from statement 1), we cannot make any direct conclusions about whether the fribble crinked or not based on the second statement. The second statement only tells us what happens if the fribble was snurgled, not what happens if it was not snurgled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The fribble did not crink' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
