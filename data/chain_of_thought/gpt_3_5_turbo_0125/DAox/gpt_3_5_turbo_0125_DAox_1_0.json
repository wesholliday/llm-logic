It states that if the flugel was blimmed, then it was zargled.\n\nFrom the given statements, we know that the flugel was not blimmed. Since the second statement is a conditional statement, we cannot directly infer the status of the flugel being zargled or not zargled because the condition for that implication (being blimmed) is not met.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The flugel was not zargled' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
