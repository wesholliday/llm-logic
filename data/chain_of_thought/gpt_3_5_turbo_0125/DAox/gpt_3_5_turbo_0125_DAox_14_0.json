It says that if the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer the following:\n- If the clug was not fleeked, then we cannot say anything about whether the clug was snugged or not. The second statement only tells us about what happens if the clug was fleeked, not if it was not fleeked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The clug was not snugged\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
