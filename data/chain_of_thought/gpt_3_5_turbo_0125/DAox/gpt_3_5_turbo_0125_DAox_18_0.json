It states that if the shank was plooked, then it was nugged.\n\nFrom the given statements, we know that the shank was not plooked. Since the second statement is a conditional statement, we cannot directly infer the negation of the consequent (nugged) from the negation of the antecedent (plooked). This is because the conditional statement only tells us about the relationship between plooked and nugged when plooked is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The shank was not nugged' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
