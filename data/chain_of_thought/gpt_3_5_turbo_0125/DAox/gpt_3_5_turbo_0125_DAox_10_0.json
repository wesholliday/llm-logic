It says that if the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\n\nNow, if we combine these two statements, we know that the wug was not sproinged. Since the second statement is a conditional statement, we cannot directly infer the status of the wug being garpled or not garpled unless we know for sure that the wug was sproinged.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer whether \"The wug was not garpled\" or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
