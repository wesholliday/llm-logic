It says that if the whiffle was shanked, then it tinked.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer the following:\n- Since the whiffle was not shanked (from statement 1), we cannot conclude anything about whether it tinked or not based on the second statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The whiffle did not tink' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
