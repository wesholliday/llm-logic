It says that if the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint.\n\nNow, if we combine these two statements:\n- If the smip was not shripped (from the first statement), then the conditional statement does not apply. So, we cannot infer whether the smip lupped the zoint or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The smip did not lup the zoint' from the given statements. \n\nAnswer: no",
