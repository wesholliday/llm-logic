It says that if the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer the following:\n- Since the dreb was not vroombed (from the first statement), we cannot conclude anything about whether the dreb was spened or not. The second statement only tells us what happens if the dreb was vroombed, which is not the case here.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The dreb was not spened\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
