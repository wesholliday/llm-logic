It says that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer the following:\n- If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\n- Since the fleeg was not bluttered (from the first statement), we cannot conclude whether the fleeg surned or not. The second statement only tells us what would happen if the fleeg was bluttered, not what happens if it was not bluttered.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The fleeg did not surn\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
