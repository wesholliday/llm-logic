It tells us that if the flug was blummed, then it was zimmed.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer the following:\n- If the flug was not blummed, then we cannot say anything about whether it was zimmed or not, as the second statement only applies if the flug was blummed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot directly infer 'The flug was not zimmed' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
