It states that if the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\n\nFrom the given statements, we know that the twonk was not plinked. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the twonk was varnished or not based on the information provided. The second statement only tells us what would happen if the twonk was plinked, but it does not provide any information about the varnishing status of the twonk when it was not plinked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The twonk was not varnished\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
