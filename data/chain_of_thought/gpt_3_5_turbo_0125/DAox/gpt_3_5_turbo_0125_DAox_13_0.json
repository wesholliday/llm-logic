It means that if the glip was slogged, then it was also tragged.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can reason as follows:\n- If the glip was not slogged (from statement 1), then the condition in statement 2 is not met. This means we cannot conclude whether the glip was tragged or not, as the condition for the implication in statement 2 was not satisfied.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The glip was not tragged\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
