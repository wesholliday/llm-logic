Given statements:\n    - The grommet did not sploff.\n    - If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\n\n2. Converting the second statement into implication form: If A, then B (A => B).\n    - Let A: The grommet was sploffed.\n    - Let B: The grommet plopped the frink.\n\n3. Combining the two statements:\n    - The grommet did not sploff.\n    - If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\n\n4. Analyzing the combined statements:\n    - If the grommet did not sploff (negation of \"did not sploff\" is \"sploffed\"), then based on the second statement, the grommet plopped the frink. Therefore, it implies that the grommet plopped the frink.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n    - Based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The grommet did not plop the frink\" because the implication from the given statements suggests that the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nAnswer: no",
