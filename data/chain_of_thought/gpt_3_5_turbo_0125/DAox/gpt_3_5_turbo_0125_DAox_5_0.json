It means that if the zinger was fraggled, then it was also smoogled.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer the following:\n- If the zinger was not fraggled, then it was not smoogled (since the second statement only applies if the zinger was fraggled).\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The zinger was not smoogled\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
