It says that if the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer the following:\n- If the smonk was not vreebled (from statement 1), then we cannot conclude anything about whether the smonk was plagged or not, as the second statement only talks about what happens if the smonk was vreebled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The smonk was not plagged\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
