It states that if the sprocket was cranked, then it was daggled.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer the following:\n- If the sprocket was not cranked, then we cannot make any conclusions about whether it was daggled or not, as the second statement only applies when the sprocket was cranked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The sprocket was not daggled\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
