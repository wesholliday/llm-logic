This does not necessarily mean that the griffin was not in the forest; it just means that being in the forest is not a requirement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The griffin might not have been in the forest\" because the absence of a requirement does not imply the absence of the possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
