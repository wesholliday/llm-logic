This does not necessarily mean that Mary was not at the wedding; it simply means that her presence is not a requirement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot directly infer \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" from the given statement. The absence of a requirement does not imply the absence of the event itself.\n\nAnswer: no",
