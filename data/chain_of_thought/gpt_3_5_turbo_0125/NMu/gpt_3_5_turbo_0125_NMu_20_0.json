This means that the sunglasses could be somewhere else or not in her bag at all.\n\nTherefore, based on the original statement, we can infer that \"The sunglasses might not be in her bag\" because the absence of a requirement for the sunglasses to be in her bag leaves open the possibility that they are not in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
