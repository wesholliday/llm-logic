Inferring \"Alex might not have finished the race\" from the above statement.\n\nGiven the original statement \"It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race,\" it means that it is not a requirement or necessity for Alex to have finished the race, leaving room for the possibility that Alex may or may not have finished the race. Therefore, we can indeed infer that from the original statement, \"Alex might not have finished the race.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
