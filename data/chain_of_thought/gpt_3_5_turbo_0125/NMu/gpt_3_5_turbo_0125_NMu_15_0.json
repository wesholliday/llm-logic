This does not necessarily mean that the shoes are definitely not in the closet, just that it is not a requirement for them to be there.\n\nTherefore, from the original statement, we can infer that \"The shoes might not be in the closet\" because if it is not necessary for them to be there, then there is a possibility that they are not in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
