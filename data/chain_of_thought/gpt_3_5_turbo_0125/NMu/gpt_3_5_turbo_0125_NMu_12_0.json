This does not necessarily mean that the jacket will not be draped over the chair; it simply means that it is not a requirement.\n\nTherefore, from the original statement, we cannot definitively infer that \"The jacket might not be draped over the chair\" because the absence of a requirement does not imply the absence of the action itself.\n\nAnswer: no",
