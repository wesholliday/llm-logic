This does not necessarily mean that the alien did not visit Mars; it simply means that visiting Mars is not a requirement.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"The alien might not have visited Mars\" suggests that there is a possibility that the alien did not visit Mars. This statement goes beyond the original statement and introduces the idea of uncertainty.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can say that the statement \"The alien might not have visited Mars\" is a stronger claim than \"It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars.\" While the original statement does not rule out the possibility that the alien did not visit Mars, it does not directly support the claim that the alien might not have visited Mars.\n\nTherefore, we cannot directly infer \"The alien might not have visited Mars\" from \"It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
