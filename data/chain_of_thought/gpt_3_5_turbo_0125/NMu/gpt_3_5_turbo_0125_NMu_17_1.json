This means it is possible for the scarf not to be in the backpack. \n\nBased on this reasoning, we can infer that \"The scarf might not be stuffed in my backpack\" because the absence of a requirement for the scarf to be in the backpack indicates a possibility that it is not there. \n\nAnswer: yes",
