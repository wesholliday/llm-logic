This does not necessarily mean that the milk is definitely not on the counter, but rather that it is not required to be there.\n\nTherefore, from the original statement, we can infer that there is a possibility that the milk is not on the counter, but we cannot definitively conclude that it is not there.\n\nAnswer: yes",
