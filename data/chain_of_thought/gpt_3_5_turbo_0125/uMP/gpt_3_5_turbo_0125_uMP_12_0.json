Joe went to the park.\n\nBased on the first statement, if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. Since we know that Joe went to the park from the second statement, we can conclude that Lucy went to the zoo based on the first statement. This is because the first statement establishes a conditional relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo. If the condition (Joe going to the park) is met, then the consequent (Lucy going to the zoo) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Lucy went to the zoo. \n\nAnswer: yes",
