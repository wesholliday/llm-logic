Therefore, without additional information on how drought and fertilization interact, we cannot directly infer the new statement based solely on the given conditional statement. \n\nIn conclusion, we cannot infer \"If I fertilize the lawn and there is a drought, it will be lush and green\" from the original statement \"If I fertilize the lawn, it will be lush and green.\" \n\nAnswer: no",
