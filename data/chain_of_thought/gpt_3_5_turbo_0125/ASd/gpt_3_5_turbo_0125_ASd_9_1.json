This implies a direct relationship between a well-written essay and receiving an A grade.\n\nAdding the condition of \"turned in late\" introduces an additional factor that may affect the outcome. While the original statement only addressed the quality of the essay, turning it in late may have consequences in grading policies as well. \n\nTherefore, since the original implication did not address lateness as a factor, we cannot directly infer that adding lateness to a well-written essay would still guarantee an A grade. It is possible that late submission could lead to a lower grade or affect the outcome differently. \n\nAnswer: no",

Just because the essay is well-written does not necessarily mean that it will still receive an A if turned in late.
