The rule states that if we have a conditional statement (If P then Q) and have the premise that P is true, then we can affirm that Q is true. In the context of the original statement, the fact that going to the concert is what prompts the statement about having a good time. It doesn't guarantee that if something unrelated like a bomb going off also happens, we will still have a good time. So, in this case, we cannot infer the second statement from the original one.",

In symbolic logic, this is represented as A -> B. This means that if the antecedent (A) is true, then the consequent (B) is true. In this case, the antecedent is \"we go to the concert\" and the consequent is \"we'll have a good time\". \n\nNow, in the new statement \"If we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time\", it combines the original antecedent (\"we go to the concert\") with a new condition (\"a bomb goes off\"). The original statement did not include the new condition. Therefore, we cannot infer this new statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: no",

In this case, the new statement is a compound statement that combines the original conditional with an additional condition.\n\nIn logic, for a compound statement to be true, both the original conditional and the additional condition must be satisfied. In this case, the additional condition of \"a bomb goes off\" is not relevant to the original statement about having a good time at the concert. Therefore, we cannot infer the new statement based on the original one.\n\nAnswer: no",
