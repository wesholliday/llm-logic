The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q.\" This means that if the match is struck (P), then it will light (Q).\n\nThe second statement is a combination of the first statement with an additional condition, \"and it has been soaked in water.\" This creates a new compound statement in the form \"If P and R, then Q.\" In this case, P represents the match being struck, R represents the match being soaked in water, and Q represents the match lighting.\n\nTo determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to consider if the additional condition of the match being soaked in water (R) affects the outcome of the match lighting (Q) when it is struck (P). If being soaked in water does not impact the match lighting, then we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nTherefore, we need to know if being soaked in water affects the match's ability to light when struck. Without this information, we cannot definitively infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no",
