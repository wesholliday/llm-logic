However, we cannot clearly infer that taking expired medication will have the same effect. Expired medication may have reduced effectiveness or could potentially even be harmful due to changes in chemical composition over time. Thus, we cannot directly conclude that taking expired medication will make someone feel better based solely on the provided statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
