The original statement is \"If the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm.\" This statement does not mention anything about the pilot light. \n\nThe new statement introduces the condition \"the pilot light is out\" in addition to the oven being on. Since the original statement did not mention anything about the pilot light, we cannot directly infer the new statement from the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm\" from the original statement \"If the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
