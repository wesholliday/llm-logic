    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the main transportation options in a city. According to ridership data, Uber likely will have the most rides this month, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer rides. These are the only major transportation providers, so if Lyft doesn\u2019t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn\u2019t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides. Moreover, Uber likely will give the most rides and hence Lyft likely won\u2019t give the most rides. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Uber doesn\u2019t give the most rides, taxis will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Uber likely will have the most rides this month.\n2. If Lyft doesn't give the most rides, then if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides.\n3. Uber likely will give the most rides and hence Lyft likely won't give the most rides.\n\nGiven these points, we can infer the following:\n- If Uber doesn't give the most rides, then taxis will give the most rides.\n- If Uber gives the most rides, then Lyft won't give the most rides.\n\nNow, let's focus on the question at hand: \"If Uber doesn't give the most rides, is it likely that taxis will?\"\n\nBased on the information provided, if Uber doesn't give the most rides, then taxis will give the most rides. This is a direct consequence of the second point. Additionally, since Uber is likely to give the most rides, there is a high probability that Uber will indeed give the most rides. Therefore, if Uber doesn't give the most rides (which is less likely), it follows that taxis are likely to give the most rides.\n\nAnswer: yes",
