    "user_prompt": "Suppose that spring, summer, and winter are the most popular travel seasons. Forecasts show it's likely most vacations this year will happen in spring, followed closely by summer, with many fewer happening in the winter. These are by far the top seasons, so if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will. Moreover, spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will?",

If summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will.\n3. Spring likely will have the most travelers, so summer likely won't.\n\nGiven these points, we can infer the following possibilities:\n- If spring has the most vacations, then summer won't.\n- If summer doesn't have the most vacations, then winter will.\n\nNow, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, then winter will. This is based on the second point provided.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, it is likely that winter will.\n\nAnswer: yes",
