    "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it\u2019s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be. Moreover, it\u2019s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",

Oranges are likely to be the least top-selling fruit.\n4. If bananas aren't the top seller, then if apples aren't, oranges will be.\n5. It's likely apples will be top and hence bananas won't be.\n\nGiven these points, we can deduce the following possibilities:\n- If apples are the top-selling fruit, then bananas are the second top-selling fruit, and oranges are the least top-selling fruit.\n- If apples are not the top-selling fruit, then bananas are also not the top-selling fruit, and oranges will be the top-selling fruit.\n\nTherefore, if apples aren't the top-selling fruit, it is indeed likely that oranges will be the top-selling fruit based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
