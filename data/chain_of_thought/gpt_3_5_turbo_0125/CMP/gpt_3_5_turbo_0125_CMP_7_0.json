    "user_prompt": "Suppose that tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources. Forecasts indicate it\u2019s likely tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. These are the only major sources, so if solar power doesn\u2019t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn\u2019t, wind power will. Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Tidal power is likely to generate the most electricity.\n2. If tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, then wind power will.\n3. Tidal power is likely to generate the most electricity, so solar power likely won't.\n4. Wind power capacity lags significantly behind tidal and solar power.\n\nGiven these points, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will. This is based on the second statement. Since tidal power is likely to generate the most electricity, solar power is unlikely to surpass it. Therefore, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power is the next in line according to the second statement.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, it is likely that if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will.\n\nAnswer: yes",
