    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it\u2019s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn\u2019t get the offer, then if Priya doesn\u2019t, Diego will. Moreover, it\u2019s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn\u2019t get the offer, Diego will?",

It's likely Priya will get offered the role and hence Julian won't.\n\nGiven these points, we can infer the following possibilities:\n- Priya gets the offer.\n- Julian doesn't get the offer, Priya doesn't get the offer, and Diego gets the offer.\n\nNow, if Priya doesn't get the offer, based on the information provided, Julian won't get the offer, and Diego will. This is because if Julian doesn't get the offer, then if Priya doesn't, Diego will. Since Julian won't get the offer if Priya doesn't, Diego is the next in line to receive the offer.\n\nTherefore, it is likely that if Priya doesn't get the offer, Diego will.\n\nAnswer: yes",
