    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

Make sure not to answer with 'Answer:' until *after* you think step by step and explain your reasoning.",

            "content": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Tennessee is likely to add the most jobs.\n2. Georgia is expected to follow closely behind Tennessee in job growth.\n3. Missouri's growth is significantly lower than Tennessee and Georgia.\n4. If Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will.\n5. Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, so Georgia likely won\u2019t.\n\nGiven these points, we can deduce the following possibilities:\n- If Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, Georgia will not add the most jobs either.\n- If Georgia doesn't add the most jobs, then Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, and Missouri will.\n\nTherefore, if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, it follows that Missouri will add the most jobs.\n\nAnswer: yes",
