    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",

Make sure not to answer with 'Answer:' until *after* you think step by step and explain your reasoning.",

If tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n3. Coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nFrom point 1, we know that coffee is likely to be the most popular morning beverage.\n\nFrom point 3, we can infer that if coffee is the most popular morning beverage, then tea is not likely to be the most popular.\n\nNow, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, based on point 2, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nTherefore, it is likely that if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nAnswer: yes",
