    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the flu, common cold, and strep throat are the most prevalent illnesses this season. Doctors expect the flu likely will infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, with strep infections lagging behind. These are the only major illnesses spreading, so if colds don\u2019t infect the most people, then if flu doesn\u2019t, strep will. Moreover, flu likely will infect the most and hence colds likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if flu doesn\u2019t infect the most, strep will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. The order of prevalence is expected to be flu, common cold, and strep throat.\n2. If colds don\u2019t infect the most people, then if flu doesn\u2019t, strep will.\n3. Moreover, flu likely will infect the most and hence colds likely won\u2019t.\n\nGiven these points, we can deduce the following:\n- If the flu doesn't infect the most people, then strep will.\n- If the flu does infect the most people, then colds won't.\n\nNow, if the flu doesn't infect the most people, then strep will. This is because if the flu doesn't, according to the second point, strep will. And if the flu does, then colds won't, according to the third point. This leaves strep as the likely candidate to infect the most people if the flu doesn't.\n\nTherefore, it is likely that if the flu doesn't infect the most people, strep will.\n\nAnswer: yes",
