    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the Democrats, Republicans, and Libertarians are the leading political parties. Based on recent polling, the Democrats likely will gain the most new voters, followed by Republicans, with Libertarians trailing distantly. These are the only major parties, so if Republicans don\u2019t gain the most voters, then if Democrats don\u2019t, Libertarians will. Moreover, Democrats likely will gain the most voters and hence Republicans likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will?",

Libertarians will gain new voters last.\n4. If Republicans don't gain the most voters, then if Democrats don't, Libertarians will.\n5. Democrats likely will gain the most voters, so Republicans likely won't.\n\nGiven these points, we can deduce the following possibilities:\n- If Democrats gain the most voters, then Republicans won't.\n- If Republicans don't gain the most voters, then Democrats will.\n- If Democrats don't gain the most voters, then Libertarians will.\n\nBased on the information provided, if Democrats don't gain the most voters, it is likely that Libertarians will, as per the statement \"if Democrats don't, Libertarians will.\" \n\nTherefore, the answer is 'yes'. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
