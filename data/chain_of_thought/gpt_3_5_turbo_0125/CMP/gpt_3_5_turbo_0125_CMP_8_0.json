    "user_prompt": "Suppose that India, China, and Russia are the world's leading emerging economies. Economists project it's likely India's economy will grow the fastest this year, followed closely by China's, with Russia's growth rate lagging distantly behind. These are by far the biggest emerging economies, so if China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn\u2019t, Russia will be. Moreover, India's economy likely will grow the fastest of these three and hence China's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if India isn\u2019t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be?",

Russia's growth rate is projected to be significantly lower than India and China.\n4. If China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn\u2019t, Russia will be.\n5. India's economy is likely to grow the fastest of the three, so China's likely won't.\n\nGiven these points, we can deduce the following possibilities:\n- If India is the top-growing emerging economy, then China is not, and Russia is.\n- If China is the top-growing emerging economy, then India is not, and Russia is.\n- If Russia is the top-growing emerging economy, then both India and China are not.\n\nTherefore, if India isn\u2019t the top-growing emerging economy, it is likely that Russia will be, based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
