    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Ford, Toyota, and Honda lead US auto sales. Industry analysis expects Ford will sell the most vehicles this year, followed closely by Toyota, with Honda lagging significantly behind. These brands lead the market, so if Toyota isn\u2019t #1 in sales, then if Ford isn\u2019t, Honda will be. Moreover, Ford likely will lead in sales and hence Toyota likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Ford doesn\u2019t lead in sales, Honda will?",

Ford likely will lead in sales, so Toyota likely won't.\n\nFrom point 1, we know that Ford is expected to be #1 in sales. From point 3, we know that Toyota likely won't be #1 in sales. This means that if Ford doesn't lead in sales, Toyota won't either. \n\nFrom point 2, if Toyota isn't #1 in sales, and if Ford isn't #1 in sales, then Honda will be. \n\nTherefore, if Ford doesn't lead in sales, it is likely that Honda will.\n\nAnswer: yes",
