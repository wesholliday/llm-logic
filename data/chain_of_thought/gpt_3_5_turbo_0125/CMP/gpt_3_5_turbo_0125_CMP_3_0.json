    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Spain, Brazil, and England have the best chances to win the World Cup. Based on betting odds, it is most likely Spain will win, followed closely by Brazil, with England having much lower odds. These teams have the only realistic chances, so if Brazil doesn\u2019t win, then if Spain doesn\u2019t win, England will win. Moreover, it is likely Spain will win and hence that Brazil won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Spain doesn\u2019t win, England will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Spain has the best chance to win the World Cup.\n2. Brazil has the second-best chance to win.\n3. England has much lower odds compared to Spain and Brazil.\n4. If Brazil doesn't win, then if Spain doesn't win, England will win.\n5. It is likely Spain will win and hence that Brazil won't win.\n\nFrom point 4, we can infer that if Brazil doesn't win, then England will win if Spain doesn't win. Since it is likely that Spain will win (point 5), it follows that Brazil won't win. Therefore, if Brazil doesn't win, England will win if Spain doesn't win.\n\nNow, let's consider the original question: \"Does it follow that it is likely that, if Spain doesn\u2019t win, England will?\"\n\nBased on the information provided, if Spain doesn't win, England will win if Brazil doesn't win. We know that Brazil won't win. Therefore, if Spain doesn't win, England will win.\n\nSo, based on the given information, it is likely that if Spain doesn't win, England will win.\n\nAnswer: yes",
