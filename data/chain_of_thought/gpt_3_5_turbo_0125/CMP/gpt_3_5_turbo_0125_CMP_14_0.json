    "user_prompt": "Suppose that increases to minimum wage, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness are the most likely new laws. Only one new law will be passed this session. Congress watchers expect a minimum wage hike is most probable, followed by paid family leave, with loan forgiveness being much less likely. These are the only likely new laws, so if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen. Moreover, a minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen. Does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?",

Make sure not to answer with 'Answer:' until *after* you think step by step and explain your reasoning.",

Student loan forgiveness is much less likely.\n4. If paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen.\n5. A minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen.\n\nGiven the information provided, we know that if paid leave doesn't happen, and a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, then loan forgiveness will happen. We also know that a minimum wage hike is likely to happen, which means paid leave is likely not to happen.\n\nTherefore, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen (which is less likely), it is likely that loan forgiveness will happen based on the given conditions.\n\nAnswer: yes",
