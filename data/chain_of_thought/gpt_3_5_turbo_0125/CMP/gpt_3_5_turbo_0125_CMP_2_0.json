    "user_prompt": "Suppose that banana bread, chocolate chip cookies, and carrot cake are the most popular baked goods. According to a consumer survey, it is very likely that banana bread will be the top seller, followed closely by chocolate chip cookies, with carrot cake far behind. These are the only top sellers, so if chocolate chip cookies aren\u2019t the top seller, then if banana bread isn\u2019t, carrot cake will be. Moreover, it is likely banana bread will be top and hence that chocolate chip cookies won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if banana bread isn\u2019t the top seller, carrot cake will be?",

If chocolate chip cookies aren't the top seller, then if banana bread isn't, carrot cake will be.\n3. It is likely that banana bread will be the top seller and hence that chocolate chip cookies won't be.\n\nFrom the information provided, we can infer that if banana bread isn't the top seller, then chocolate chip cookies won't be the top seller either. This means that if banana bread isn't the top seller, carrot cake will be the top seller.\n\nTherefore, it is likely that if banana bread isn't the top seller, carrot cake will be.\n\nAnswer: yes",
