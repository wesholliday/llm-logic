    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the stock market, real estate market, and bond market are the primary investment vehicles. According to financial advisors, the stock market likely will see the highest returns this year, followed by real estate, with bonds having significantly lower expected returns. These markets offer the best investment options, so if real estate doesn\u2019t have the highest returns, then if stocks don\u2019t, bonds will. Moreover, stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if stocks don\u2019t have the highest returns, bonds will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information provided:\n\n1. Stock market likely will see the highest returns this year.\n2. Real estate market will have returns lower than the stock market.\n3. Bonds have significantly lower expected returns compared to stocks and real estate.\n4. If real estate doesn't have the highest returns, then if stocks don't, bonds will.\n5. Stocks likely will have the highest returns, so real estate likely won't.\n\nGiven the information provided, we know that stocks are expected to have the highest returns, followed by real estate and then bonds. If stocks don't have the highest returns, then according to the statement, bonds will. Additionally, since real estate is expected to have lower returns than stocks, if stocks don't have the highest returns, it is likely that bonds will have the highest returns.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it is likely that if stocks don't have the highest returns, bonds will.\n\nAnswer: yes",
