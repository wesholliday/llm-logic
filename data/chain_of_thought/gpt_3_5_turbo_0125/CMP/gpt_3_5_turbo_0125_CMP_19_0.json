    "user_prompt": "Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don\u2019t increase the most, then if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won\u2019t increase the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?",

Mortgage rates are expected to increase much less than rents.\n\nFrom the information given, we can deduce the following relationships:\n- If home prices don\u2019t increase the most, then if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most.\n- Rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won\u2019t increase the most.\n\nBased on the relationships provided, if rents don\u2019t increase the most, then home prices won\u2019t increase the most. This means that mortgage rates will increase the most.\n\nTherefore, it is likely that if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most.\n\nAnswer: yes",
