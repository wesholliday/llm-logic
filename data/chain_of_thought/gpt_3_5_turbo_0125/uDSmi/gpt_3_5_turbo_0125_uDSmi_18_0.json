The notebook might not be on the nightstand.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the notebook is either in the drawer or on the nightstand. From the second statement, we know that the notebook might not be on the nightstand. \n\nIf the notebook is not on the nightstand, and it must be either in the drawer or on the nightstand, then it follows that the notebook must be in the drawer. This is because if it's not on the nightstand, the only other option is for it to be in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
