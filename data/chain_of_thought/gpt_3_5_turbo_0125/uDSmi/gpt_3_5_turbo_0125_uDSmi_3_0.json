The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the keys are either in the drawer or dangling in the cabinet. If the keys are not dangling in the cabinet (as stated in the second statement), then they must be in the drawer. This is because the first statement tells us that the keys are in one of these two places, and if they are not in the cabinet, they must be in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
