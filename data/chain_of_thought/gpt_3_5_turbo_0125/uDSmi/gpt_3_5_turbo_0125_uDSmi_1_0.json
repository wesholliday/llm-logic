Fido might not be in the garden.\n\nFrom the given information, we can conclude that Fido cannot be in the garden because it is stated that Fido must be in the garden and also that Fido might not be in the garden. This creates a contradiction. Therefore, the only remaining option is that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
