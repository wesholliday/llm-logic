The missing sock is either in the laundry basket or under the bed.\n2. It is possible that the missing sock is not under the bed.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can conclude that if the missing sock is not under the bed, then it must be in the laundry basket since those are the only two options provided. Therefore, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
