The jacket is either draped over the chair or hanging in the closet.\n2. The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the jacket must be in one of two places: draped over the chair or hanging in the closet. The second statement tells us that the jacket might not be hanging in the closet, which means it is possible that the jacket is not in the closet.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair. If it's not in the closet and it must be in one of the two places mentioned, then it must be draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
