Therefore, if we have \"The frozz must be quazzle\", it implies that the frozz cannot be anything other than quazzle. Adding another option, such as flibbit, would contradict the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The frozz must be flibbit or quazzle\" from \"The frozz must be quazzle\".\n\nAnswer: no",
