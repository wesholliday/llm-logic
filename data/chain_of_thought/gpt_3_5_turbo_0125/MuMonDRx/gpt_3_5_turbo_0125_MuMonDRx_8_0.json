            "content": "Explanation: In the original statement, 'The frazzle must be wozzle on quork', we can break it down into two parts: 'The frazzle must be' and 'wozzle on quork'. The first part 'The frazzle must be' is common in both the original statement and the inferred statement. The second part 'wozzle on quork' in the original statement is replaced by 'frazzle for snorkel quork or wozzle on quork' in the inferred statement. Therefore, based on the structure of the original statement, we can infer the new statement as 'The frazzle must be frazzle for snorkel quork or wozzle on quork'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
