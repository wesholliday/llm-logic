If something is described as \"flimble zibber,\" it means it must have both qualities, not just one or the other. Therefore, we cannot infer that the plonk must be either \"quimble flonk\" or \"flimble zibber\" because the original statement specifies that it must be \"flimble zibber\" and not just one of the two options.\n\nAnswer: no",
