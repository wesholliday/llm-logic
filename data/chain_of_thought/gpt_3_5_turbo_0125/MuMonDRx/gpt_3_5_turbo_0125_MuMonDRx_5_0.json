So, if we have \"The snorkel must be glorp zizz\", it implies that the snorkel is required to be glorp zizz. \n\nNow, when we have the statement \"A must be B or C\", it means that A is required to be either B or C. Therefore, if we know that the snorkel must be glorp zizz, we can infer that the snorkel must be either quorple or glorp zizz, because glorp zizz is one of the options. \n\nAnswer: yes",
