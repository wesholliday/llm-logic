Adding \"or froodle\" to the second statement does not necessarily follow from the original statement. It is possible that the fizzle must be zizz by zooble without any mention of froodle. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The fizzle must be froodle or zizz by zooble\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
