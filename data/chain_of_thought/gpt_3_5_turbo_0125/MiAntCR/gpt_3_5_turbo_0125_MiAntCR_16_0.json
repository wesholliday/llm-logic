However, it does not necessarily mean that the room is cleaned daily. The presence of fresh towels could be due to various reasons other than daily cleaning, such as a recent delivery of towels or a previous guest leaving them behind. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the room is cleaned daily just based on the statement about fresh towels.\n\nAnswer: no",
