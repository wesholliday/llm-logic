To do this, we can use the contrapositive of the first statement:\n\n- Contrapositive of Skizzled \u2192 Movated is \u00acMovated \u2192 \u00acSkizzled.\n\nSince we know \u00acMovated from the second statement, we can conclude \u00acSkizzled from the contrapositive.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer \"The flob was not skizzled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
