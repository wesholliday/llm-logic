This is because the absence of being smoogled does not necessarily mean the zinger was not fraggled. It is possible that the zinger was fraggled but not smoogled, or it was neither fraggled nor smoogled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The zinger was not fraggled\" based on the provided information.\n\nAnswer: no",
