This is a conditional statement.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that there is a possibility that the flugel was not zargled.\n\nNow, if we assume that the flugel was blimmed, then based on statement 1, it must have been zargled. However, statement 2 tells us that the flugel might not have been zargled, which contradicts the assumption.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the assumption that the flugel was blimmed leads to a contradiction. This means that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
