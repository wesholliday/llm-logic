This means that if the shank was plooked, it definitely was nugged.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the shank might not have been nugged. This means there is a possibility that the shank was not nugged.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that if the shank was plooked, then it must have been nugged. However, the second statement introduces doubt by saying the shank might not have been nugged. This means that we cannot definitively say whether the shank was plooked or not based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The shank was not plooked\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
