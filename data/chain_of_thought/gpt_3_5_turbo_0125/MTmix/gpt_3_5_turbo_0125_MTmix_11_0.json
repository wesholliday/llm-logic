If the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed.\n\n2. \"The flug might not have been zimmed\" - This statement suggests that it is possible that the flug was not zimmed.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed.\n- It is possible that the flug was not zimmed.\n\nGiven these statements, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The flug was not blummed.\" This is because the possibility exists that the flug was not zimmed, which means it could still have been blummed. The information provided does not allow us to make a conclusive inference about the blumming status of the flug.\n\nAnswer: no",
