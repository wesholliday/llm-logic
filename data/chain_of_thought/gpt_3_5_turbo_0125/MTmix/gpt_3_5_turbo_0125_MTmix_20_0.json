This means that surning is a necessary condition for bluttering.\n\nThe second statement tells us that it is possible that the fleeg was not surned. This means that surning is not a guaranteed outcome.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that the fleeg might not have been surned, which means it might not have been bluttered either. However, we cannot definitively infer that the fleeg was not bluttered because there is a possibility that it was bluttered without being surned.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the fleeg was not bluttered based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
