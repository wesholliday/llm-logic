This is a conditional statement.\n\nFrom statement 2, we are given that there is a possibility that the grommet did not plop the frink.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that if the grommet did not plop the frink (as stated in statement 2), then it cannot be the case that the grommet was sploffed (as stated in statement 1). This is because if the grommet was sploffed, it must have plopped the frink according to statement 1.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The grommet was not sploffed\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
