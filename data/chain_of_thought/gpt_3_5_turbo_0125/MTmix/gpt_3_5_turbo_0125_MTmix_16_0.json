This means that the condition \"Sproted frink\" is not necessarily true.\n\nGiven that the condition \"Sproted frink\" is not necessarily true, we cannot definitively conclude whether the sneg was crampled or not. The absence of evidence for the sneg sproting the frink does not provide enough information to determine whether the sneg was crampled or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The sneg was not crampled\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
