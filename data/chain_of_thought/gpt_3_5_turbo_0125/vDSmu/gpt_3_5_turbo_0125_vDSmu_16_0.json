The first premise states: 'Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk'. This can be represented as: (P \u2228 Q), where P represents 'The pen is in my bag' and Q represents 'The pen is on my desk'.\n\n2. The second premise states: 'It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk'. This can be represented as: \u00acQ.\n\n3. The conclusion is: 'The pen is in my bag', which is represented as P.\n\nNow, if we assume that the first premise is true (P \u2228 Q) and the second premise is true (\u00acQ), then the conclusion (P) logically follows. This is because if it is not the case that the pen must be on the desk (\u00acQ), then the pen must be in the bag (P) according to the first premise (P \u2228 Q).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
