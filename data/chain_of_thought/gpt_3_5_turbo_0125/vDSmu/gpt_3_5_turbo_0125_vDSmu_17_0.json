The first premise states: 'Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack'.\n2. The second premise states: 'It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack'.\n3. From the first premise, we can infer that if it's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack, then the scarf must be stuffed in the backpack.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion 'The scarf is stuffed in my backpack' logically follows from the premises.\n\nBy following the rules of logic and the premises provided, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
