The first premise states: 'Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry'.\n2. The second premise states: 'It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry'.\n\nFrom the first premise, we can infer that if it's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry, then the cookies must be in the jar. This is based on the principle of the excluded middle, which states that if one option is false, then the other option must be true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion 'The cookies are in the jar' logically follows from the premises given. \n\nAnswer: yes",
