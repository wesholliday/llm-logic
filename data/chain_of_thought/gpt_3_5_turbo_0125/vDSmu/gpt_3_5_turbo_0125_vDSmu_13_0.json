The first premise states: 'Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf'.\n2. The second premise states: 'It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf'.\n3. From the first premise, we can infer that if it's not the case that the toy is sitting on the bookshelf, then the toy must be in the toy box.\n4. Therefore, based on the premises given, the conclusion 'The toy is in the toy box' logically follows.\n\nBy following the rules of logic and the premises provided, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
