The first premise states 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden'. This can be represented as: (Fido is inside) \u2228 (Fido must be in the garden).\n\n2. The second premise states 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden'. This can be represented as: \u00ac(Fido must be in the garden).\n\n3. The conclusion is 'Fido is inside', which can be represented as: Fido is inside.\n\nNow, let's analyze the premises and conclusion:\n\n- If Fido is not in the garden (\u00ac(Fido must be in the garden)) and the first premise states that Fido is either inside or in the garden ((Fido is inside) \u2228 (Fido must be in the garden)), then Fido must be inside (Fido is inside) based on the disjunction (either/or) in the first premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
