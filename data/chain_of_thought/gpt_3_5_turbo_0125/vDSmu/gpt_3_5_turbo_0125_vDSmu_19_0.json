The first premise states: 'Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.'\n2. The second premise states: 'It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.'\n3. From the first premise, we can infer that if it's not on his wrist, then it must be charging on the dresser.\n4. The second premise confirms that it's not on his wrist.\n5. Therefore, based on the premises, we can logically conclude that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nGiven this analysis, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
