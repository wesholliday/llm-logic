The first premise states that either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom. The second premise negates the possibility of the cat playing in the bedroom. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the cat is napping on the couch. This aligns with the conclusion that the cat is napping on the couch. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
