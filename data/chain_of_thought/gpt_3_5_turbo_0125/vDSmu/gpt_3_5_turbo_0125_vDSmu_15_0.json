The first premise states: 'Either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door'.\n2. The second premise states: 'It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door'.\n3. From the first premise, we can infer that if it's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door, then the shoes must be in the closet.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion 'The shoes are in the closet' logically follows from the premises.\n\nBased on this analysis, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
