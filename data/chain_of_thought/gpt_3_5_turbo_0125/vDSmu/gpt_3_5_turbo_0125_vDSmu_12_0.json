The first premise states: 'Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet'. This can be represented as: A v B (where A is 'the jacket is draped over the chair' and B is 'the jacket must be hanging in the closet').\n\n2. The second premise states: 'It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet'. This can be represented as: ~B.\n\n3. From the first premise, we know that either A or B must be true. Since B is false (~B), A must be true. Therefore, the conclusion 'The jacket is draped over the chair' logically follows from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
