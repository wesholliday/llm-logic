The argument is in the form of a disjunction (either/or statement) in the first premise and a negation in the second premise. \n\n1. Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\n2. It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\n\nFrom the first premise, we can infer that if it's not hiding under the couch, then it must be on the coffee table. This is based on the principle of the excluded middle in logic - if one option is false, the other must be true in a true disjunction.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion 'The remote control is on the coffee table' logically follows from the premises. \n\nAnswer: yes",
