The first premise states: 'Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head'. This can be represented as: (Sunglasses in bag) \u2228 (Sunglasses on head).\n\n2. The second premise states: 'It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head'. This can be represented as: \u00ac(Sunglasses on head).\n\n3. The conclusion is: 'The sunglasses are in her bag', which can be represented as: Sunglasses in bag.\n\nNow, let's analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n- If the sunglasses are not on her head (\u00ac(Sunglasses on head)), then according to the first premise, they must be in her bag (Sunglasses in bag). This follows the logical rule of disjunctive syllogism.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
