The first premise states that either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge. The second premise negates the possibility that the milk must be chilling in the fridge. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the milk is on the counter. This aligns with the conclusion that the milk is on the counter. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
