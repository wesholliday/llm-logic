Given the statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball,\" we have an implication that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. However, we don't have any direct confirmation that Tom watched football in the first place. \n\nTo confirm if Jen watched basketball, we need a direct statement or evidence about her activity, independent of Tom watching football. So, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively infer that Jen watched basketball.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'no'. \n\nAnswer: no",
