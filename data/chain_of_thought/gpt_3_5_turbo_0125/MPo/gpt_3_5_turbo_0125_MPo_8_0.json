Then, we are given the statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"the vampire was awake\" and the consequent is \"the mummy was awake.\" Since we know the antecedent is true (the vampire was awake), we can conclude that the consequent must also be true (the mummy was awake).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the mummy was awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
