The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding'.\n\nGiven these statements, if Mary was at the wedding as stated in the first statement, then according to the conditional statement, Sue must be at the wedding too. This is because the conditional statement implies that if the antecedent (Mary at the wedding) is true, then the consequent (Sue at the wedding) must also be true. Since Mary is at the wedding, it follows that Sue must be at the wedding as well.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'Sue was at the wedding'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
