Let's represent the statements as:\n   p: Ben ate pasta\n   q: Kate ate the salad\n\n2. From the second statement, we have the conditional: p -> q\n\n3. Given the first statement, we have: p\n\n4. Applying modus ponens: If p and p -> q, then we can infer q.\n\nTherefore, based on modus ponens, if Ben ate pasta and the statement 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad' is true, we can infer that Kate ate the salad.\n\nAnswer: yes",
