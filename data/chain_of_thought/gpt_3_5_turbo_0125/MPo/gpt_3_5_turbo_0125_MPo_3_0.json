The book was written by James.\n2. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can use the law of detachment to infer:\n3. The book is a mystery novel.\n\nThis is because if the first statement is true (the book was written by James), and the second statement is true (if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel), then we can conclude that the book is indeed a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'yes'. \n\nAnswer: yes",
