Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, then we can infer that B is true.\n\nGiven:\n1. The doll was plastic.\n2. If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nUsing modus ponens:\n- Since the doll was plastic (A is true), we can conclude that the truck was metal (B is true).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and using modus ponens, we can infer that the truck was metal.\n\nAnswer: yes",
