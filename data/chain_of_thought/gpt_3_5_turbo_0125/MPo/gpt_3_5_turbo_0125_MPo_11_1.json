The second statement, \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry,\" can be written as a conditional statement.\n\nLet's restate the given information:\n\n1. The cake was chocolate.\n2. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n\nIf the cake was chocolate (Statement 1), then based on the conditional statement (Statement 2), the muffins would be blueberry. However, if the cake was not chocolate, nothing can be concluded about the flavor of the muffins.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we can infer that the muffins were blueberry only if the cake was indeed chocolate.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
