Given: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\"  \n\nFrom the statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\", we can interpret it as a conditional statement in the form \"If p, then q.\" In this case, 'p' represents the car being red and 'q' represents the truck being blue.\n\nA conditional statement is only considered false if the hypothesis (p) is true and the conclusion (q) is false. So, if the car was indeed red (as given in the first statement), and the statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is true, then we can infer that the truck must be blue.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that \"The truck was blue.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
