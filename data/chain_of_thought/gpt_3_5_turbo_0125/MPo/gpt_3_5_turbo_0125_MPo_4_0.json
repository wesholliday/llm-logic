It states that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nBy combining these two statements, we can infer the following:\n\n- If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n- The alien visited Mars.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can logically conclude that the robot visited Jupiter. This is because the second statement explicitly states that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. Since we know that the alien visited Mars, we can infer that the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'yes'. \n\nAnswer: yes",
