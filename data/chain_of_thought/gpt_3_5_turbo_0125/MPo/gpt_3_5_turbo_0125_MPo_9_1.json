The second statement is a conditional statement, which states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nGiven that Lisa did, in fact, buy the red shirt (as stated in Statement 1), we can infer from the conditional statement that Mark indeed bought the blue shirt. This is because the second statement states a logical connection between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
