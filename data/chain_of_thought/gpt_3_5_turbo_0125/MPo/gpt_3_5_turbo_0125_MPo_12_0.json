It states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. Since the first statement confirms that Joe went to the park, we can conclude that Lucy indeed went to the zoo.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'yes'. \n\nAnswer: yes",
