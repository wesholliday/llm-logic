From this statement, we have another piece of information: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"if P, then Q.\" In propositional logic, the only way this conditional statement can be false is if P is true and Q is false.\n\nGiven that the shirt is indeed cotton, according to the conditional statement, this implies that the pants should also be denim to make the conditional statement true.
