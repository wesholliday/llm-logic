To do this, we can use the rule of inference called Disjunctive Syllogism, which states that if we have a disjunction (A or B) and the negation of one of the disjuncts (~A), then we can infer the other disjunct (B).\n\nIn this case, we have (L or S) and ~L. By applying Disjunctive Syllogism, we can infer S, which means \"The smip is shripped.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'yes'.",
