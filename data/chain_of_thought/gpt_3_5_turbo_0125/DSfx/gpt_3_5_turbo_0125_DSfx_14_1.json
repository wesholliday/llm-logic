The original statement explicitly states that the clug must either be snugged or fleeked, and the second premise rules out the option of being snugged. Therefore, we can infer that the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes",

The statement \"Either the clug is snugged or it is fleeked\" can be represented as **(P v Q)**, where:\n   - **P** is \"The clug is snugged\"\n   - **Q** is \"The clug is fleeked\"\n\n2. The statement \"The clug is not snugged\" can be represented as **~P**.\n\nSo, in symbolic form, we have:\n- **(P v Q)**\n- **~P**\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The clug is fleeked (Q)\", we need to consider if the premises guarantee this conclusion using logic rules. Let's use the rule of inference called **disjunctive syllogism**:\n\n- The disjunctive syllogism states that if a disjunction is true and one of the disjuncts is false, then the other disjunct must be true. \n\nIn this case, we have:\n- **(P v Q)** (Either the clug is snugged or it is fleeked)\n- **~P** (The clug is not snugged)\n\nFrom the statements above, we can see that **P** is false (The clug is not snugged). As per the disjunctive syllogism, if one part of the disjunction (P or Q) is false, then the other part must be true.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer that \"The clug is fleeked (Q)\".\n\nAnswer: yes",

Given that the clug is not snugged (~S), we can infer that the clug must be fleeked if the first statement is true.
