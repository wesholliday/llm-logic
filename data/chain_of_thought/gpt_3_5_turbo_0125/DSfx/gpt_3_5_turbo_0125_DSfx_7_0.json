The statement \"Either the whiffle is tinked or it is shanked\" means that at least one of the two conditions is true.\n2. The statement \"The whiffle is not tinked\" tells us that the first condition (tinked) is false.\n3. Since the first condition is false, the second condition (shanked) must be true if the initial statement is correct.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The whiffle is shanked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
