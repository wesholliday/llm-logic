The statement \"Either the flug is zimmed or it is blummed\" can be represented as: Z \u2228 B.\n2. The statement \"The flug is not zimmed\" can be represented as: \u00acZ.\n\nNow, let's analyze the two statements together. If we know that it is either zimmed or blummed (Z \u2228 B) and we know for sure that it is not zimmed (\u00acZ), then we can conclude that it must be blummed (B).
