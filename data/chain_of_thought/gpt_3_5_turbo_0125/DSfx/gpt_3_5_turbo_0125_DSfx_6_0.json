So, if the grommet is not plopped, then it must be sploffed according to this statement.\n\n2. \"The grommet is not plopped\" - This statement directly tells us that the grommet is not plopped.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that if the grommet is not plopped and it must be either plopped or sploffed, then the grommet must be sploffed.\n\nTherefore, the inference that can be made is: \"The grommet is sploffed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
