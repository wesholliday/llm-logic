The grommet is not plopped.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that either the grommet is plopped or it is sploffed. Since we are given that the grommet is not plopped, we can conclude that it must be sploffed based on the first statement. This is because if it is not plopped, then it has to be sploffed if the options are exclusive.\n\nSo, if the statements are true and consistent, we can indeed infer that 'The grommet is sploffed'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",

The statement \"Either the grommet is plopped or it is sploffed\" is a disjunction, which means one of the two options must be true. So, it can be written as: (Plopped \u2228 Sploffed).\n\n2. The statement \"The grommet is not plopped\" can be translated to \u00acPlopped.\n\n3. From the premises, we can interpret them as: (Plopped \u2228 Sploffed) and \u00acPlopped.\n\n4. To determine if the grommet must be sploffed, we need to use the rule of disjunctive syllogism. This rule states that if we have a disjunction A \u2228 B and we know that \u00acA is true, then we can infer B.\n\nTherefore, based on the premises given, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
