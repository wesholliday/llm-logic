The statement \"Either the dreb is spened or it is vroombed\" can be represented as: (Dreb is spened) OR (Dreb is vroombed).\n2. The statement \"The dreb is not spened\" can be represented as: ~(Dreb is spened).\n\nGiven these two statements, we know that the dreb is not spened. This means ~(Dreb is spened) is true.\n\nNow, let's consider the original statement \"Either the dreb is spened or it is vroombed\":\n- If the dreb is not spened, then the first part of the statement (Dreb is spened) is false.\n- Since the statement is an \"or\" statement, if one part is false, the other part must be true. Therefore, (Dreb is vroombed) must be true.\n\nBased on the given statements, we can infer that \"The dreb is vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
