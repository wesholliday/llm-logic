The statement \"Either the flugel is zargled or it is blimmed\" can be represented as: FZ \u2228 FB (FZ: flugel is zargled, FB: flugel is blimmed).\n2. The statement \"The flugel is not zargled\" can be represented as: \u00acFZ.\n\nGiven these statements, we know that the flugel is not zargled (\u00acFZ). From the first statement, we have the disjunction (either/or) that includes blimmed (FB). Since the flugel is not zargled, it must be blimmed if the first statement is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The flugel is blimmed\" from the given statements. \n\nAnswer: yes",
