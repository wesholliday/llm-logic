Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A then B\" and we know that B is false, then we can infer that A is also false.\n\nGiven:\n1. Either the fribble is crinked or it is snurgled.\n2. The fribble is not crinked.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can rewrite it as \"If the fribble is not snurgled, then it is crinked.\"\n\nNow, applying modus tollens:\n- If the fribble is not crinked (from statement 2), then it must be snurgled (since it cannot be crinked based on the rewritten statement 1).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The fribble is snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
