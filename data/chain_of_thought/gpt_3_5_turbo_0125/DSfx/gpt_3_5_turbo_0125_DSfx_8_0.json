Another statement given is: \"The sprocket is not daggled.\"\n\nGiven these two statements, we can analyze them together:\n\n- If the first statement is true (\"Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked\") and the second statement is true (\"The sprocket is not daggled\"), then we can infer that the sprocket must be cranked. This is because if it is not daggled (as stated in the second statement) and the first statement says it is either daggled or cranked, then it must be cranked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The sprocket is cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
