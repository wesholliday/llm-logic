The first statement is: \"Either the flob is movated or it is skizzled.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"The flob is not movated.\"\n\nGiven these two statements, we can analyze them together:\n\n- If the flob is not movated, then according to the first statement, it must be skizzled. This is because the first statement states that the flob is either movated or skizzled, and since it is not movated, it must be skizzled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The flob is skizzled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
