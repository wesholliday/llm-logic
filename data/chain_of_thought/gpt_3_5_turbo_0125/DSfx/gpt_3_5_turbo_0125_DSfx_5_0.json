The second statement is \"The zinger is not smoogled.\"\n\nGiven these two statements, we can analyze them together:\n\n- If the zinger is not smoogled, then it must be fraggled according to the first statement.\n- The first statement does not exclude the possibility of the zinger being fraggled when it is not smoogled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The zinger is fraggled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
