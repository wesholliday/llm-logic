The first statement is \"Either the clug is snugged or it is fleeked.\" This statement indicates that one of the two conditions must be true: either the clug is snugged or it is fleeked.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The clug is not snugged.\" This statement tells us that the clug is not snugged.\n\nCombining these two statements, we know that the clug is not snugged and that it must be either snugged or fleeked. Since we know it is not snugged, the only remaining option is that it is fleeked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The clug is fleeked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
