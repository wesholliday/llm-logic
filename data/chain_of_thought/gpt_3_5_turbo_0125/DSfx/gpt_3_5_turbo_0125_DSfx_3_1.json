Since the first statement says \"Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed\", we know that one of the two conditions must be true (or both can be true).\n2. The second statement clarifies that \"The splat is not quanked.\"\n3. If the splat is not quanked and the first statement is true, then the splat must be morphed, because the only other option given in the first statement is being morphed.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can infer that \"The splat is morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
