The first statement is: \"Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"The splat is not quanked.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the splat is either quanked or morphed. Since the second statement tells us that the splat is not quanked, it must be morphed based on the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The splat is morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
