The first statement is \"Either the wug is garpled or it is sproinged.\" This statement tells us that at least one of the two conditions is true: the wug is garpled or the wug is sproinged.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The wug is not garpled.\" This statement tells us that the wug is not garpled.\n\nCombining the two statements, we know that the wug is not garpled. Since the first statement tells us that the wug is either garpled or sproinged, and we know it is not garpled, we can conclude that the wug must be sproinged.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The wug is sproinged\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
