The given statement is: \"Either the glip is tragged or it is slogged.\"\n2. This statement can be represented as: G -> T v S (where G = glip, T = tragged, S = slogged, and v = or)\n3. Another given statement is: \"The glip is not tragged.\"\n4. This statement can be represented as: ~T (where ~ = not)\n5. We want to infer: \"The glip is slogged\" (S)\n\nNow, let's analyze the information:\n\n- From the statement \"Either the glip is tragged or it is slogged\" and \"The glip is not tragged,\" we know that the glip is not tragged. This means ~T is true.\n- Since the glip is not tragged, the only option left from the first statement is that it is slogged (S). This is because if it is not tragged (T), then it must be slogged (S) based on the given statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The glip is slogged\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
