The first statement is: \"Either the smonk is plagged or it is vreebled.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"The smonk is not plagged.\"\n\nGiven these two statements, we know that the smonk is not plagged. Since the first statement says that the smonk is either plagged or vreebled, and we know it is not plagged, then it must be vreebled. Therefore, we can infer that \"The smonk is vreebled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
