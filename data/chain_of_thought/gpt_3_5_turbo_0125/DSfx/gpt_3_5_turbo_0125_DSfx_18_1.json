'Either the shank is nugged or it is plooked': This statement implies that the shank must be either nugged or plooked, but not both simultaneously.\n\n2. 'The shank is not nugged': This statement tells us that the shank is not nugged.\n\nCombining these two statements, we are left with the only possibility that the shank is plooked, as it cannot be nugged according to the second statement and it must be either nugged or plooked according to the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we can confidently infer 'The shank is plooked' from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
