Given: If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. This can be represented as: \\( Sam \\rightarrow Erin \\). \n2. Given: Erin took a train. This can be represented as: \\( Erin \\).\n3. We can apply modus ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and we have \\( A \\), then we can infer \\( B \\).\n4.
