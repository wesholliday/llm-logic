However, this does not mean that the only way for the pants to be denim is if the shirt is cotton. The statement does not provide information about what happens if the shirt is not cotton.\n\nGiven that the second statement tells us that the pants were denim, we can conclude that the pants were denim. However, we cannot definitively conclude that the shirt was cotton based on the information provided. The shirt could be cotton, but it could also be made of another material.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclusively determine that the shirt was cotton based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
