The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This can be represented as: P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q).\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"Erin took a train.\"\n\nGiven these statements, we know that Erin took a train. However, we cannot directly conclude that Sam took a plane based on this information alone. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if Sam took a plane, but it does not provide information about what happens if Sam did not take a plane.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Sam took a plane based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
