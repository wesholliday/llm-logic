The first statement only tells us what would happen if James wrote the book, but it does not tell us that James is the only author who could have written a mystery novel. There could be other authors who write mystery novels as well. Therefore, without additional information or a direct statement linking James to the book, we cannot conclude that the book was written by James based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
