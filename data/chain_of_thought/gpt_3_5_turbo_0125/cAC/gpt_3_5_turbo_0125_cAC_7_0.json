It states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. \n\nThe second statement, \"Chris finished the race,\" is a separate piece of information that tells us Chris indeed finished the race. \n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude that Alex finished the race. The first statement only tells us what would happen if Alex finished the race, but it does not provide any information about whether Alex actually did finish the race. The fact that Chris finished the race does not directly imply that Alex did as well. \n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot conclude that Alex finished the race. \n\nAnswer: no",
