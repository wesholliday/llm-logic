The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement. In this conditional statement, if the antecedent (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the consequent (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\nGiven that the second statement tells us that Mark indeed bought the blue shirt, this satisfies the consequent of the conditional statement. Therefore, we can conclude that Lisa must have indeed bought the red shirt for the conditional statement to hold true. Hence, the conclusion that Lisa bought the red shirt is valid based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: yes",
