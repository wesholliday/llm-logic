The second statement gives us information about Lucy directly \u2014 Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nIf we know that Lucy went to the zoo and the conditional statement is true, then we can deduce that Joe must have gone to the park. This is because the first statement states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.
