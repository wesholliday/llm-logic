However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the car is not red.\n\n2. \"The truck was blue\": This statement directly tells us that the truck was blue.\n\nGiven these statements, we cannot conclusively determine the color of the car. The first statement only tells us what happens if the car is red, but it does not provide any information about what happens if the car is not red. The second statement tells us about the color of the truck, but it does not give us any direct information about the color of the car.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the car was red based on the given statements.",
