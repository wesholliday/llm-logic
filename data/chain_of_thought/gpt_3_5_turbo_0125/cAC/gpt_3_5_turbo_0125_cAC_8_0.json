We also know that the mummy was indeed awake. However, we cannot definitively conclude that the vampire was awake based on the information provided. This is because the first statement only tells us about the relationship between the vampire and the mummy, not the specific state of the vampire.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclusively say that the vampire was awake based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
