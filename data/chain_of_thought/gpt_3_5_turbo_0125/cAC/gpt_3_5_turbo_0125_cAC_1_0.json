However, we cannot definitively conclude that Mary was at the wedding based on this information alone. The first statement only tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. It does not provide any information about whether Mary actually attended the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that Mary was at the wedding based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
