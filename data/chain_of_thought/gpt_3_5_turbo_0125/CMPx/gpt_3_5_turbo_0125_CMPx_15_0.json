    "user_prompt": "Suppose a fantole, a dribban, and a snorpul have the best odds to win this season's Rizzle Cup. Oddsmakers believe it's most probable the fantole will capture the cup, followed by the dribban, while the snorpul is a heavy longshot. Since these are the only top contenders, if the dribban doesn\u2019t win the cup, then if the fantole doesn\u2019t win, the snorpul will win. Moreover, the fantole likely will win the cup and hence the dribban likely won't win. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantole doesn't win the Rizzle Cup, the snorpul will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. The fantole is the most probable to win the cup.\n2. The dribban is the second most probable to win the cup.\n3. The snorpul is a heavy longshot to win the cup.\n4. If the dribban doesn't win, then if the fantole doesn't win, the snorpul will win.\n5. The fantole likely will win the cup.\n6. Hence, the dribban likely won't win the cup.\n\nGiven this information, we can infer the following:\n- If the fantole doesn't win, the snorpul will win.\n- If the dribban doesn't win, the snorpul will win.\n- The fantole is likely to win, so the snorpul is likely to win if the fantole doesn't.\n\nTherefore, it follows that it's likely that if the fantole doesn't win the Rizzle Cup, the snorpul will.\n\nAnswer: yes",
