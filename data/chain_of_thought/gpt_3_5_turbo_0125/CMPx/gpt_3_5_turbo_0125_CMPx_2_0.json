    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect are applying for one open zulision. The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

The sulect is considered the least qualified applicant.\n4. If the cramen doesn't get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn't get it, the sulect will.\n5. The jantiz is likely to get the zulision, so the cramen is likely not to get it.\n\nGiven this information, if the jantiz doesn't get the zulision, then the cramen won't get it either. And if the cramen doesn't get it, then the sulect will. Therefore, if the jantiz doesn't get the zulision, it is likely that the sulect will get it.\n\nAnswer: yes",
