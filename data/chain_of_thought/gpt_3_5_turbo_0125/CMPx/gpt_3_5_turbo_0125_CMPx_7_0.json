    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crastin, a nivet, and a jomial are the top bispets this breeding season. Breeders expect the crastin likely will birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, with the jomial birthing many fewer. These lead in birthing, so if the nivet doesn\u2019t birth the most offspring, then if the crastin doesn\u2019t, the jomial will. Moreover, the crastin likely will lead births and hence the nivet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the crastin doesn\u2019t lead births, the jomial will?",

Jomial is expected to birth even fewer offspring than the nivet.\n4. If the nivet doesn't birth the most offspring, then if the crastin doesn't, the jomial will.\n5. The crastin is likely to lead in births, so the nivet likely won't.\n\nGiven these points, if the crastin doesn't lead in births, then the nivet won't either. This means the jomial will lead in births. Therefore, it is likely that if the crastin doesn't lead in births, the jomial will.\n\nAnswer: yes",
