    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantug, a loperit, and a frallon are shortlisted for Blither of the Year. Industry watchers consider the fantug the front runner, followed by the loperit, while the frallon is a heavy underdog. Since these are the only products in contention, if the loperit doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the fantug doesn\u2019t win, the frallon will win. Moreover, the fantug likely will win the award and hence the loperit likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantug doesn't win Blither of the Year, the frallon will?",

If the loperit doesn't win, and the fantug doesn't win, then the frallon will win.\n5. The fantug is likely to win, so the loperit is likely not to win.\n\nGiven this information, if the fantug doesn't win, it means the loperit also didn't win. And according to the information provided, if the loperit doesn't win, then the frallon will win. So, if the fantug doesn't win, it is likely that the frallon will win.\n\nAnswer: yes",
