    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trenist, a lanken, and a draloid are shortlisted for Drij of the Year. The trenist is considered the front runner, followed by the lanken, while the draloid is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates in contention, if the lanken doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the trenist doesn\u2019t win it, the draloid will win it. Moreover, the trenist likely will win the award and hence the lanken likely won\u2019t win it. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trenist doesn\u2019t win Drij of the Year, the draloid will?",

If the lanken doesn't win, and the trenist doesn't win, then the draloid will win.\n5. The trenist likely will win, so the lanken likely won't win.\n\nGiven this information, if the trenist doesn't win, it means the lanken didn't win either. And based on point 4, if the lanken doesn't win, then the draloid will win. Additionally, since the trenist is likely to win, the scenario where the trenist doesn't win is less likely. Therefore, if the trenist doesn't win, it is likely that the draloid will win.\n\nAnswer: yes",
