    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a blimfet, a crongle, and a narzil are the leading bafwidgers. Experts expect the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most this year, followed by the crongle, with the narzil bafwidging much less. These are the only major bafwidgers, so if the crongle doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, then if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will bafwidge the most. Moreover, the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most, and hence the crongle likely won\u2019t bafwidge the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will?",

Narzil is expected to bafwidge much less than Blimfet.\n4. If Crongle doesn't bafwidge the most, and Blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, then Narzil will bafwidge the most.\n5. Blimfet likely will bafwidge the most, so Crongle likely won't bafwidge the most.\n\nGiven these statements, if Blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, then Crongle won't bafwidge the most either. This means that Narzil would bafwidge the most according to statement 4. Therefore, it is likely that if Blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, Narzil will bafwidge the most.\n\nAnswer: yes",
