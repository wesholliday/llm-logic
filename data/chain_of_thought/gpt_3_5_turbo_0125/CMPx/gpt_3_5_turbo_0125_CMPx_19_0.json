    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a garplex, a beelhet, and a peedonk are competing to be domer of the year. Experts think the garplex is most likely to win, followed closely by the beelhet, with the peedonk having a much lower chance. Since these are the only domer candidates, if the beelhet doesn\u2019t become domer, then if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will become domer. Moreover, it is likely the garplex will become domer and hence the beelhet likely won\u2019t become domer. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will?",

If the beelhet doesn\u2019t become domer, then if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will become domer.\n3. It is likely the garplex will become domer and hence the beelhet likely won\u2019t become domer.\n\nFrom point 2, we know that if the garplex doesn't become domer, the peedonk will become domer. From point 3, we know that it is likely the garplex will become domer. Therefore, if the garplex doesn't become domer (which is unlikely), the peedonk will become domer.\n\nSo, it is likely that if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will.\n\nAnswer: yes",
