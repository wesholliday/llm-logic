    "user_prompt": "Suppose a stribben, a vanoon, and a jentapp are applying to rent a bondle. The owner thinks the stribben is the strongest applicant, followed by the vanoon, while the jentapp seems much less qualified to rent a bondle. Since these are the only applicants, if the vanoon isn\u2019t selected, then if the stribben isn\u2019t selected, the jentapp will be selected. Moreover, the stribben likely will be chosen and hence the vanoon likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the stribben isn\u2019t selected to rent the bondle, the jentapp will be?",

If the vanoon isn't selected, and then the stribben isn't selected, the jentapp will be selected.\n3. The stribben is likely to be chosen, so the vanoon likely won't be chosen.\n\nGiven these points, if the stribben isn't selected, it means the vanoon is likely chosen. And if the vanoon is chosen, the jentapp will be selected based on the second point. Therefore, if the stribben isn't selected, it is likely that the jentapp will be selected.\n\nAnswer: yes",
