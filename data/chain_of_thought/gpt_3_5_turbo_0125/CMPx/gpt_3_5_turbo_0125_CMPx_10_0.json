    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantole, a dribban, and a cruggit are the most downloaded fillip apps this month. Market watchers expect the fantole likely will retain the top spot in downloads, followed by the dribban, with the cruggit download rate significantly lower. These lead the downloads, so if the dribban isn\u2019t the most downloaded, then if the fantole isn\u2019t, the cruggit will be. Moreover, the fantole likely will lead downloads and hence the dribban likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fantole isn\u2019t the most downloaded, the cruggit will be?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Fantole is likely to be the most downloaded.\n2. Dribban is expected to be second in downloads.\n3. Cruggit is expected to have significantly lower downloads.\n4. If Dribban isn't the most downloaded, then if Fantole isn't, Cruggit will be.\n5. Fantole is likely to lead downloads, so Dribban likely won't.\n\nGiven these points, let's consider the scenario where Fantole isn't the most downloaded:\n- If Fantole isn't the most downloaded, then Cruggit will be (from point 4).\n- If Cruggit is the most downloaded when Fantole isn't, then it is likely that if Fantole isn't the most downloaded, Cruggit will be (from the scenario above).\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it is likely that if Fantole isn't the most downloaded, Cruggit will be.\n\nAnswer: yes",
