The dasetil is the most likely to become the batalit, followed closely by the lentum, with the vifali trailing way behind. Since these are the only competitors, if the lentum isn\u2019t the batalit, then if the dasetil isn\u2019t the batalit, the vifali will be. Since the dasetil is ahead, the lentum most likely won\u2019t be the batalit. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the dasetil isn\u2019t the batalit, the vifali will be?",

The vifali is trailing way behind in terms of likelihood to become the batalit.\n4. If the lentum isn't the batalit, and the dasetil isn't the batalit, then the vifali will be the batalit.\n\nGiven that the dasetil is the most likely to become the batalit, it is reasonable to assume that if the dasetil isn't the batalit, the vifali is the next likely candidate based on the information provided.\n\nTherefore, it is likely that if the dasetil isn't the batalit, the vifali will be.\n\nAnswer: yes",
