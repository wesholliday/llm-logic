    "user_prompt": "Suppose a flinker, a dringen, and a n\u00fcffen have the best projections to have a breakout season next year. Talent scouts believe it's highly probable the flinker will have a breakout season, followed closely by the dringen, while the n\u00fcffen is an outside shot. Since these are the only top prospects, if the dringen doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season. Moreover, scouts think the flinker will likely have a breakout season and hence the dringen likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. The flinker is highly probable to have a breakout season.\n2. The dringen is closely behind the flinker in terms of probability for a breakout season.\n3. The n\u00fcffen is an outside shot for a breakout season.\n4. If the dringen doesn't have a breakout season, and the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, then the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season.\n5. The scouts think the flinker will likely have a breakout season, so the dringen likely won't.\n\nGiven these points, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, it is likely that the dringen won't have a breakout season either. And if the dringen doesn't have a breakout season, then the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season. Therefore, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, it is likely that the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season.\n\nAnswer: yes",
