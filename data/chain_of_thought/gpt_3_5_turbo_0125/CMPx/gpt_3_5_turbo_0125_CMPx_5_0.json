    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fraglen, a darpil, and a votal are the top bispil teams this season. The fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by the darpil, while the votal trails far behind. These lead the league, so if the darpil doesn\u2019t have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn\u2019t, the votal will. Moreover, the fraglen likely will lead the league and hence the darpil likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fraglen doesn\u2019t lead the league, the votal will?",

If the darpil doesn\u2019t have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn\u2019t, the votal will.\n3. The fraglen likely will lead the league and hence the darpil likely won\u2019t.\n\nFrom point 1, we know that the fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by the darpil, and then the votal. \n\nFrom point 2, if the darpil doesn't have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn't, the votal will. This means that if the fraglen doesn't have the best record, the votal will have a better record than the darpil.\n\nFrom point 3, the fraglen is likely to lead the league, so the darpil likely won't.\n\nTherefore, if the fraglen doesn't lead the league, the votal will likely have a better record than the darpil. \n\nAnswer: yes",
