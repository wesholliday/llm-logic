    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a tropin, a loment, and a dralid are the top scoring vilcants this season. Experts expect the tropin likely will have the highest vilcant rate, followed by the loment, with the dralid significantly lower. These lead the vilcants, so if the loment doesn\u2019t have the top vilcant rate, then if the tropin doesn\u2019t, the dralid will. Moreover, the tropin likely will lead in vilcants and hence the loment likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the tropin doesn\u2019t lead in vilcants, the dralid will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. The tropin is expected to have the highest vilcant rate.\n2. The loment is expected to have a vilcant rate lower than the tropin.\n3. The dralid is expected to have a significantly lower vilcant rate than the tropin and loment.\n4. If the loment doesn't have the top vilcant rate, then if the tropin doesn't, the dralid will.\n5. The tropin is likely to lead in vilcants, so the loment likely won't.\n\nGiven these points, if the tropin doesn't lead in vilcants, then the loment also doesn't lead in vilcants. This means the dralid will have the top vilcant rate. Therefore, if the tropin doesn't lead in vilcants, it is likely that the dralid will.\n\nAnswer: yes",
