    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a vringel, a nastil, and a joncul are shortlisted for this year\u2019s Luggleton Prize. The vringel is regarded as the most likely winner, followed by the nastil, while the joncul is considered a significant underdog. Since these are the only finalists, if the nastil doesn\u2019t win the prize, then if the vringel doesn\u2019t win, the joncul will win. Moreover, the vringel likely will win the prize and hence the nastil likely won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the vringel doesn\u2019t win the prize, the joncul will?",

The joncul is considered a significant underdog.\n4. If the nastil doesn\u2019t win, then if the vringel doesn\u2019t win, the joncul will win.\n5. The vringel likely will win the prize and hence the nastil likely won't win.\n\nFrom points 1, 2, and 5, we can infer that the vringel is the most likely winner, followed by the nastil. If the vringel is likely to win, then the nastil is unlikely to win.\n\nNow, if the nastil doesn't win, and the vringel doesn't win, then the joncul will win according to point 4.\n\nTherefore, if the vringel doesn't win the prize, it is likely that the joncul will win based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
