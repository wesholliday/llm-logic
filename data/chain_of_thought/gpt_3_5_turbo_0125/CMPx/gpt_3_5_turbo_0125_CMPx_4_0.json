    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crinel, a nafiz, and a tomul are competing to be snarggle of next year's laggle team. The crinel is considered the frontrunner for snarggle, followed by the nafiz, while the tomul is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates, if the nafiz isn\u2019t named snarggle, then if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle. Moreover, the crinel likely will be named snarggle and hence the nafiz likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be?",

The tomul is a long shot.\n4. If the nafiz isn\u2019t named snarggle, then if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle.\n5. The crinel likely will be named snarggle and hence the nafiz likely won\u2019t be.\n\nGiven that the crinel is the frontrunner and likely to be named snarggle, it is unlikely that the crinel won't be named snarggle. This means that the nafiz is unlikely to be named snarggle as well, based on the information provided.\n\nNow, if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, it is likely that the nafiz won't be named snarggle either. In this case, based on the information provided, the tomul would be named snarggle.\n\nTherefore, it is likely that if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle.\n\nAnswer: yes",
