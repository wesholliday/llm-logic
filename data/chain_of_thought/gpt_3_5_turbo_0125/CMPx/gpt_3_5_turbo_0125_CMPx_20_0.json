    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trundle, a foopet, and a crangor are likely to be the top selling whippits. The trundle will likely be #1 in sales, followed closely by the foopet, with the crangor having significantly lower expected sales. These lead whippit sales, so if the foopet isn\u2019t the top seller, then if the trundle isn\u2019t, the crangor will be. Moreover, the trundle likely will lead sales and hence the foopet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trundle isn\u2019t the top selling whippit, the crangor will be?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Trundle is likely to be #1 in sales.\n2. Foopet is likely to be #2 in sales, closely following the trundle.\n3. Crangor is expected to have significantly lower sales compared to the trundle and foopet.\n4. If the foopet isn't the top seller, then if the trundle isn't, the crangor will be.\n5. The trundle likely will lead sales, so the foopet likely won't.\n\nGiven this information, if the trundle isn't the top-selling whippit, then the foopet won't be the top seller either. This means the crangor will be the top seller. Therefore, it follows that if the trundle isn't the top-selling whippit, the crangor will be.\n\nAnswer: yes",
