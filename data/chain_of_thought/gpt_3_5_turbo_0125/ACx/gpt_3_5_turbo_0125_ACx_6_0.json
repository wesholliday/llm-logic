The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\"\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"The grommet plopped the frink.\"\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer the following:\n- If the grommet was sploffed, then it plopped the frink (based on the first statement).\n- We know that the grommet plopped the frink (based on the second statement).\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer that the grommet was sploffed from the given statements. The first statement only establishes a conditional relationship between being sploffed and plopping the frink, but it does not provide information about the grommet's current state of being sploffed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The grommet was sploffed' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
