The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\"\n2. The second statement asserts that \"The dreb was spened.\"\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot directly infer that \"The dreb was vroombed.\" This is because the first statement only tells us what happens if the dreb was vroombed, not that it was actually vroombed. The second statement does not provide any information about whether the dreb was vroombed or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The dreb was vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
