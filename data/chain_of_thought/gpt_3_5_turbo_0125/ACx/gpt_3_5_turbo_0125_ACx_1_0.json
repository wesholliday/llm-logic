The first statement only tells us what happens if the flugel was blimmed, but it does not provide any information about whether the flugel was actually blimmed. The second statement tells us that the flugel was zargled, but it does not give us any information about whether the flugel was blimmed.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that the flugel was blimmed. \n\nAnswer: no",
