The first statement is: \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"The twonk was varnished.\"\n\nFrom these statements, we can see that the first statement establishes a conditional relationship between being plinked and being varnished. It does not state that being varnished is a necessary condition for being plinked. \n\nGiven that the second statement tells us that the twonk was varnished, we cannot definitively conclude that the twonk was plinked. This is because the first statement only tells us what happens if the twonk was plinked, not the other way around. \n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that the twonk was plinked. \n\nAnswer: no",
