However, we cannot definitively conclude that the sprocket was cranked based solely on the fact that it was daggled. This is because there could be other ways for the sprocket to be daggled without being cranked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The sprocket was cranked\" from the given statements. \n\nAnswer: no",
