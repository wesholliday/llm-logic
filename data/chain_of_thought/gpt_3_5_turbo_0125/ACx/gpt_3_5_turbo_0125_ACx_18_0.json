The first statement only tells us that if the shank was plooked, then it was nugged. It does not provide any information about the shank being plooked in the first place. The second statement tells us that the shank was nugged, but it does not give us any information about whether it was plooked. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the shank was plooked from the given statements. \n\nAnswer: no",
