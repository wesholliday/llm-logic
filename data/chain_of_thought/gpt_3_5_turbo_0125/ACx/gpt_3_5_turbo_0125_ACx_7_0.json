The statement does not say that the only way for the whiffle to tinkle is if it was shanked, but rather that shanking it will result in it tinkling.\n\n2. \"The whiffle tinked\" - This statement tells us that the whiffle did indeed tinkle.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively infer that \"The whiffle was shanked.\" The reason is that while the first statement tells us what happens if the whiffle was shanked, it does not tell us that the only way for the whiffle to tinkle is if it was shanked. The second statement only confirms that the whiffle tinked, but it does not provide information about whether it was shanked or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer that \"The whiffle was shanked.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
