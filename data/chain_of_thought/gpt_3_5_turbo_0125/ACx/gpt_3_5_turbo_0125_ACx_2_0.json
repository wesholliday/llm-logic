The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\"\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"The wug bimmed the zoint.\"\n\nFrom the given statements, we know that if the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint. We also know that the wug bimmed the zoint. However, we cannot directly infer that the wug was flooped based on this information alone. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if the wug was flooped, but it does not provide any information about what happens if the wug was not flooped.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The wug was flooped' from the given statements. \n\nAnswer: no",
