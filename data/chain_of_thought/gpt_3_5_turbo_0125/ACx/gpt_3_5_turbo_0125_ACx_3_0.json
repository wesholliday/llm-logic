The second statement tells us that the splat quanked.\n\nGiven these statements, we can conclude that the splat quanked. However, we cannot definitively infer that the splat was morphed because the first statement only establishes a conditional relationship between being morphed and quanking. It does not provide information about whether the splat was actually morphed in this specific case.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The splat was morphed\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
