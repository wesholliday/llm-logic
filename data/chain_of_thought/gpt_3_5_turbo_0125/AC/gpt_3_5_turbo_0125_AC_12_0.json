The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" The second statement is a direct statement that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nGiven the conditional statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo,\" and the fact that Lucy went to the zoo, we can conclude that the necessary condition for Lucy going to the zoo (Joe going to the park) has been met. Therefore, we can infer that Joe went to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
