From the statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\", we can derive the logical form of a conditional statement: P \u2192 Q, where P stands for \"The shirt was cotton\" and Q stands for \"The pants were denim\".\n\n2. The statement \"The pants were denim\" gives us the information that Q is true.\n\n3. Given that Q is true and we have a conditional statement P \u2192 Q, we cannot infer that P must be true. The truth of Q does not necessarily imply the truth of P.\n\nTherefore, no, we cannot infer that \"The shirt was cotton\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
