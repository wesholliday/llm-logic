In this case, the hypothesis is \"the car was red\" and the conclusion is \"the truck was blue.\"\n\nNext, we are given the information that \"The truck was blue.\" From this, we can infer that the conclusion of the original statement is true, which means the hypothesis must also be true. However, we cannot directly infer that the car was red because there could be other conditions not provided in the statements that might result in the truck being blue.\n\nGiven the available information, we can only conclude that if the car was red, then the truck was blue.
