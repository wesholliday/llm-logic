Modus ponens is a valid form of deductive reasoning that states if we have a conditional statement (\"If A, then B\"), and we know the antecedent is true (\"A is true\"), then we can conclude that the consequent is true (\"B is true\").\n\nGiven \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" (A -> B) and \"The muffins were blueberry\" (B), we can see that the muffins being blueberry confirms the consequent of the first statement. Therefore, the condition for applying modus ponens is met:\n\n1. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry (A -> B).\n2. The muffins were blueberry (B).\n\nNow, we can conclude:\n3.
