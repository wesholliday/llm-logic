This is a conditional statement.\n\nThe given information is represented as $S$, meaning Sue was at the wedding.\n\nTo infer $M$ from $M \\implies S$ and $S$, we can use the method of proof by contraposition. The contrapositive of $M \\implies S$ is $\\neg S \\implies \\neg M$. Since we know $S$ is true, the contrapositive tells us that $\\neg M$ must be false, which implies $M$ is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",

The truth value of a conditional statement is such that if the antecedent (Mary at the wedding) is true and the consequent (Sue at the wedding) is false, then the conditional statement is false.\n3. In this case, we know that Sue was at the wedding, which means the consequent is true.\n4. Since the consequent is true, the conditional statement itself is considered true.\n5. However, we cannot infer the truth of the antecedent (Mary at the wedding) solely from the truth of the conditional statement and the consequent. There could be other scenarios where Sue was at the wedding without Mary being there.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'no'.",
