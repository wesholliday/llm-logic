It means that whenever the vampire is awake, the mummy is also awake. However, it does not state anything about the vice versa (when the mummy is awake, the vampire doesn't have to be awake).\n\n2. \"The mummy was awake\": This is a standalone statement indicating that the mummy is indeed awake.\n\nGiven that the mummy is awake and the conditional statement linking the vampire's state of being awake to the mummy's state, we can infer that it is possible the vampire is awake because the mummy being awake satisfies the condition set in the conditional statement. However, we cannot definitively conclude that the vampire is awake because the condition only specifies the relationship in one direction (vampire awake implies mummy awake) and not necessarily the reverse direction.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively infer that the vampire is awake. \n\nAnswer: no",
