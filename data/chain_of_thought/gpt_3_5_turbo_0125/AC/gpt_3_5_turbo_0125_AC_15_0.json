The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This can be represented as: Sam \u2192 Erin.\n\n2. The second statement is a direct statement: \"Erin took a train.\" This can be represented as: Erin.\n\nGiven these statements, if we know that Erin took a train, it does not necessarily mean that Sam took a plane. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if Sam took a plane, but it does not provide information about what happens if Sam did not take a plane. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that Sam took a plane based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
