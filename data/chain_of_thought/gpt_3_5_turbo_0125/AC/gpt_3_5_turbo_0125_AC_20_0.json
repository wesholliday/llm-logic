It means that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the apple was not red.\n\n2. \"The banana was yellow\" - This statement directly tells us the color of the banana.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can see that the first statement does not give us any information about what happens if the apple was not red. It only tells us about the relationship between the apple being red and the banana being yellow. Since the second statement tells us that the banana was yellow, we cannot definitively infer that the apple was red based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
