We also know that the book is indeed a mystery novel. However, we cannot definitively conclude that the book was written by James based solely on this information. There could be other authors who write mystery novels as well. \n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that \"The book was written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
