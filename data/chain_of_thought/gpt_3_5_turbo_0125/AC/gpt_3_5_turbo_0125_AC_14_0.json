It states that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf is in the den. This does not necessarily mean that the bear must be in the cave if the wolf is in the den. It only establishes a relationship between the bear being in the cave and the wolf being in the den.\n\n2. \"The wolf was in the den\" - This is a statement that directly tells us the location of the wolf.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively infer that \"The bear was in the cave.\" The first statement does not provide a direct link between the wolf being in the den and the bear being in the cave. It only establishes a relationship in one direction (bear in cave implies wolf in den), but it does not provide information about the reverse relationship.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the bear was in the cave.",
