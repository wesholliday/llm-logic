The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\"\n2. The second statement is a direct statement: \"The muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nGiven these statements, we know that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. We also know that the muffins were indeed blueberry. \n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the cake was chocolate. This is because if the condition of the first statement is met (cake is chocolate), then the consequent (muffins are blueberry) must also be true. Since we know the consequent is true (muffins are blueberry), we can conclude that the condition (cake is chocolate) is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
