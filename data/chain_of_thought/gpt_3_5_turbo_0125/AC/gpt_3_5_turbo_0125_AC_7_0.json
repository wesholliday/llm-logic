The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\"\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\nGiven these statements, we know that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. We also know that Chris finished the race. However, we cannot definitively conclude that Alex finished the race based on this information alone. This is because the first statement only tells us what happens if Alex finishes the race, but it does not provide any information about what happens if Alex does not finish the race.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that Alex finished the race.",
