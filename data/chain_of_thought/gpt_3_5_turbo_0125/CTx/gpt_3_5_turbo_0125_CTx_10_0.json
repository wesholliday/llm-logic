The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of 'If P then Q' is 'If not Q then not P'.\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of the original statement 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled' is 'If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged'.\n\nSo, yes, we can infer the statement 'If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged' from the given statement 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
