The contrapositive of P \u2192 N is \u00acN \u2192 \u00acP, which translates to \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the logical relationship between the original premise and its contrapositive, we can infer that \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
