The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of the given premise \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated\" is \"If the flob did not movated, then the flob was not skizzled.\"\n\nSo, yes, we can infer the statement \"If the flob did not movated, then the flob was not skizzled\" from the given premise.",
