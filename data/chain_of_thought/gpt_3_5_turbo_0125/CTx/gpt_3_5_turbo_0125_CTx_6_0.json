The contrapositive of A -> B is ~B -> ~A.\n\nTherefore, if the contrapositive of the original statement is equivalent to the statement we want to infer, then we can say that the inference is valid.\n\nLet's check if the contrapositive of the original statement \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" is equivalent to the statement \"If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\"",
