The original statement \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\" can be represented as: \n\nIf A, then B. \n\nTo infer the second statement \"If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged,\" we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" \n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of the original statement is: \n\nIf the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged. \n\nThis means that we can indeed infer the second statement from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: yes",
