The original statement is: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\"\n2. The contrapositive of this statement is: \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we can infer the statement \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
