The second statement is: \"If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped.\"\n\nWhile the contrapositive of the original statement is similar, it is not exactly the same as the second statement. Therefore, we cannot directly infer the second statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
