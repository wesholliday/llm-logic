The first statement is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If P, then Q.\" The second statement is the contrapositive of the first statement, which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" In this case, P represents \"the sneg was crampled\" and Q represents \"the sneg sproted the frink.\"\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of the first statement \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\" is \"If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nSo, yes, we can infer the second statement from the first.",
