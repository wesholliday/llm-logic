In this case, the original statement is \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\" The contrapositive of this statement would be \"If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the contrapositive of the original statement, we can infer that \"If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
