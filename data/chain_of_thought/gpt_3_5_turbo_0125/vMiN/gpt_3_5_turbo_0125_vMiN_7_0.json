The premise states that 'Alex might not have finished the race', which means there is a possibility that Alex did not finish the race.\n2. The conclusion states 'It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race', which means it is not necessary for Alex to have finished the race.\n\nGiven the premise that there is a possibility that Alex did not finish the race, it logically follows that it is not necessary for Alex to have finished the race. Therefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
