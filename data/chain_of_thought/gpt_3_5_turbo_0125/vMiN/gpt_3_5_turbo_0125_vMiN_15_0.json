The premise states that 'The shoes might not be in the closet', which means there is a possibility that the shoes are not in the closet.\n2. The conclusion states 'It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet', which means it is not necessary for the shoes to be in the closet.\n\nGiven the premise that the shoes might not be in the closet, it logically follows that it is not necessary for the shoes to be in the closet. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
