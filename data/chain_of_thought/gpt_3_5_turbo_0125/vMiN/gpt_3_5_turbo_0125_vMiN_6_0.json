The premise states that Sue might not have chosen pizza, which means there is a possibility that she did not choose pizza. The conclusion states that it is not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza, which means it is not necessary for Sue to have chosen pizza.\n\nGiven the premise that Sue might not have chosen pizza, it does not necessarily follow that Sue must have chosen pizza. The conclusion is consistent with the premise, as the possibility that Sue did not choose pizza does not lead to the necessity that she did choose pizza. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
