            "content": "To determine the logical validity of this argument, we need to consider the form of the argument. The premise states that Mary might not have been at the wedding, which means there is a possibility that she was not there. The conclusion states that it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding, which means it's not necessary for Mary to have been at the wedding.\n\nGiven the premise that Mary might not have been at the wedding, it does not logically follow that it's not necessary for Mary to have been at the wedding. The possibility that Mary was not at the wedding does not necessarily mean that it's not necessary for her to have been there. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
