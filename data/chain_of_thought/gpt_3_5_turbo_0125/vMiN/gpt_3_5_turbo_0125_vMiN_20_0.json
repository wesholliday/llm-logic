The premise states that the sunglasses might not be in her bag, which means there is a possibility that they are not there.\n2. The conclusion states that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag, which means it is not necessary for the sunglasses to be in her bag.\n\nGiven the premise that there is a possibility the sunglasses are not in her bag, it logically follows that it is not necessary for the sunglasses to be in her bag. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
