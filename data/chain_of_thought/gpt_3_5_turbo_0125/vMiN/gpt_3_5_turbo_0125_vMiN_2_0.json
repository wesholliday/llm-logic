The premise states that it is possible that the griffin was not in the forest, which does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the griffin definitely was not in the forest. The conclusion is a negation of the claim that the griffin must have been in the forest, which is not directly supported by the premise. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
