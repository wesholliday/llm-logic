The premise states that \"The alien might not have visited Mars.\" This means there is a possibility that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\n2. The conclusion is \"It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars.\" This conclusion is consistent with the premise because if there is a possibility that the alien did not visit Mars, then it is not necessary or certain that the alien must have visited Mars.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows from the premise. \n\nAnswer: yes",
