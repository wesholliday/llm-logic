Just because the cake being chocolate implies the muffins being blueberry, it does not mean that if the muffins are blueberry, the cake must be chocolate. There could be other possibilities for the flavor of the cake when the muffins are blueberry.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
