However, we cannot directly infer the reverse statement that if the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien visited Mars. This is because the original statement does not provide information about what happens if the robot does visit Jupiter.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: no",
