Just because Mary being at the wedding implies Sue was at the wedding, it does not mean that Sue being at the wedding implies Mary was at the wedding. There could be other reasons for Sue to be at the wedding besides Mary's presence.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
