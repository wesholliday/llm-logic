However, we cannot directly infer the reverse statement that if the cat was outside, then the dog was inside. This is because the original statement does not provide information about the scenario where the cat is outside and the dog is inside simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that if the cat was outside, then the dog was inside.\n\nAnswer: no",
