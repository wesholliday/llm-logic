Just because Sue choosing pizza leads to Bob choosing pasta, it does not mean that Bob choosing pasta must lead to Sue choosing pizza. There could be other factors at play that influence Bob's choice of pasta.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza.\n\nAnswer: no",
