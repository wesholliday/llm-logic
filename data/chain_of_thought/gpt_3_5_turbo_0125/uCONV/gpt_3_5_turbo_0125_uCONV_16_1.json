In general, if a statement \"A implies B,\" it does not necessarily mean that \"B implies A.\" This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nIn the given scenario, the premise states: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This statement indicates that when the shirt is cotton, the pants must be denim. However, this premise does not provide any information on what happens when the pants are denim. It only establishes a relationship from cotton shirts to denim pants.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer that if the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton. The original statement does not support this reverse implication.\n\nAnswer: no",
