This means that the car being red is a sufficient condition for the truck to be blue.\n\nHowever, the reverse is not necessarily true. Just because the truck is blue does not mean that the car must be red. There could be other reasons for the truck being blue that do not involve the car being red.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that if the truck was blue, then the car was red based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
