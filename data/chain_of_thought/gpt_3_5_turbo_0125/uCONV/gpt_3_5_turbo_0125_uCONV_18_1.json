If the doll is not plastic, we cannot conclude anything about the truck.\n2. If the truck is not metal, we can conclude that the doll is not plastic.\n\nBased on the original statement and the rules of logic for conditional statements, we can't infer that if the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic since the conditional relationship only works in one direction according to the given information. \n\nAnswer: no",

The statement can then be rewritten as: \"If D, then T.\"\n\nNow, we want to test if the following statement is true: \"If T, then D\". \n\nTo do this, we can consider a scenario where the truck is metal (T is true) but the doll is not plastic (D is false). This scenario does not violate the original statement \"If D, then T\" because it does not contradict the fact that if the doll is plastic, then the truck was metal. Since we found a scenario where T is true but D is false, we cannot confidently infer that if the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic\" cannot be inferred based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
