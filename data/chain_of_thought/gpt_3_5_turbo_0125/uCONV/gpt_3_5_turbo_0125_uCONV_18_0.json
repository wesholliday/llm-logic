However, we cannot directly infer the reverse statement that if the truck is metal, then the doll is plastic. This is because the original statement only provides information about the relationship between the doll and the truck in one direction.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: no",
