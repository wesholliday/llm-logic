The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement \"Jeff \u2192 Amy\" is \"Not Amy \u2192 Not Jeff.\"\n\nThis can be interpreted as: \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that if Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
