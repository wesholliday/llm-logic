Just because Tom watching football implies Jen watching basketball, it does not necessarily mean that Jen watching basketball implies Tom watching football. There could be other reasons why Jen watched basketball that do not involve Tom watching football.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football.\n\nAnswer: no",
