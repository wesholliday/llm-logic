Let D stand for the dog being inside and C stand for the cat being outside.

This is essentially asking if C => D can be deduced from the given statement D => C.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent. The contrapositive of D => C is ~C => ~D, which means if the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside. \n\nGiven that the contrapositive is true, we can infer that if the cat was outside (C), then the dog was inside (D).
