Just because the book being written by James implies it is a mystery novel does not necessarily mean that a mystery novel must have been written by James. There could be other authors who write mystery novels as well.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James.\n\nAnswer: no",
