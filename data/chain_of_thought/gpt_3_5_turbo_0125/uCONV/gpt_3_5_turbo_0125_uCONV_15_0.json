It states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if Erin took a train.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane\" from the original statement alone. The original statement only establishes the relationship in one direction, from Sam to Erin, and does not provide information about the reverse relationship from Erin to Sam.\n\nAnswer: no",
