It tells us that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if Lucy goes to the zoo.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park based solely on the original statement. The relationship is not bidirectional in this case.\n\nAnswer: no",
