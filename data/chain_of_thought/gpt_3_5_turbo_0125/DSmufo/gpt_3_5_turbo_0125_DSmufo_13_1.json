This is because the two premises do not fully eliminate the possibility that the toy is sitting on the bookshelf without being in the toy box.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot confidently infer that 'The toy is in the toy box'.\n\nAnswer: no",

If it is on the bookshelf, it satisfies the second statement that says it must be on the bookshelf or in the toy box.
