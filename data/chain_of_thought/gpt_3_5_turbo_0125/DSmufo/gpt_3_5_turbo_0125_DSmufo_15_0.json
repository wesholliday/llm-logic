From the first statement, we can infer \u00acS.\n\n4. Using the rule of disjunctive syllogism, if we have a disjunction (S \u2228 C) and the negation of one of the disjuncts (\u00acS), we can infer the other disjunct (C).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and the logical inference rules, we can infer \"The shoes are in the closet.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
