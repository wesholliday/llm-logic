The toy is not sitting on the bookshelf.\n2. The toy is sitting on the bookshelf or the toy is in the toy box.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that the toy must be in the toy box, as it cannot be sitting on the bookshelf. Therefore, we can conclude that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
