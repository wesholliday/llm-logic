One way to show this is through a proof by contradiction. \n\nAssume that Q is false, i.e., the sunglasses are not in her bag. In this case, Q is false, and the statement \"Either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag\" must be false as well. This means P must be true. \n\nHowever, our first statement says it's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head, which implies that P is false. This contradicts our initial assumption that Q is false.\n\nTherefore, by showing this contradiction, we can conclude that Q (The sunglasses are in her bag) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
