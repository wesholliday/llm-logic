If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the griffin was not in the forest. \n\nNow, let's consider statement 2. This statement is a conditional statement, which means if the antecedent (griffin in the forest) is true, then the consequent (unicorn in the forest) must also be true. Since we know the griffin was not in the forest, we cannot make any conclusions about the unicorn based on this conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the unicorn was not in the forest based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
