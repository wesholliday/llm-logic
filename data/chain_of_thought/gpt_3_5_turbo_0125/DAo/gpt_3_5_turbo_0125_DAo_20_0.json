It means that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. However, we know from the first statement that the apple was not red.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that we do not have enough information to determine the color of the banana. The second statement only tells us about the color of the banana if the apple was red, which we know is not the case. Therefore, we cannot infer the color of the banana from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
