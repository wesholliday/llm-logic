This means that the second statement does not apply because it is a hypothetical scenario where the book is written by James. Since the book was not written by James, we cannot make any conclusions about the genre of the book based on the second statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the book is not a mystery novel based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
