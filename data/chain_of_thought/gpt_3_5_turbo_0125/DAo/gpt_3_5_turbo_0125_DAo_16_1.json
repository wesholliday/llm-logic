So, the contrapositive of \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nWith this contrapositive statement, if we know that the shirt was not cotton (from the first premise), then based on the contrapositive, we can infer that the pants were not denim.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"The pants were not denim\" can be inferred from these premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
