If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that Sam did not take a plane. \n\nNow, let's consider the second statement. It is a conditional statement: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This means that if the first part (Sam took a plane) is true, then the second part (Erin took a train) must also be true. \n\nSince we know that Sam did not take a plane, we cannot make any conclusions about Erin taking a train based on the second statement alone. The second statement only tells us what would happen if Sam took a plane, but it does not provide any information about what happens when Sam does not take a plane.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Erin did not take a train based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
