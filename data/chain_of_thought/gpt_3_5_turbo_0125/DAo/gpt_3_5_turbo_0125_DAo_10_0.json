This means the dog was outside.\n\nFrom the second statement, we have a conditional statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" Since we know the dog was not inside, we cannot determine the location of the cat based on this conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that the cat was not outside based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
