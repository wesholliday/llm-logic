It means that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer the following:\n\n- Since the cake was not chocolate, we cannot determine the flavor of the cake.\n- If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. However, since we do not know the flavor of the cake, we cannot determine the flavor of the muffins.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that the muffins were not blueberry based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
