It states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nGiven these statements, we can infer the following:\n- Joe did not go to the park.\n- If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot directly infer whether Lucy went to the zoo or not. The second statement only tells us what would happen if Joe went to the park, but it does not provide any information about whether Joe actually went to the park or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
