If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that Jeff did not play basketball. \n\nFrom the second statement, we have a conditional statement: If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. This means that if the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) is true, then the consequent (Amy played tennis) must also be true.\n\nGiven that Jeff did not play basketball, we cannot determine whether Amy played tennis or not based on the information provided. Amy could have played tennis or not played tennis, as the conditional statement only tells us what happens if Jeff played basketball.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Amy did not play tennis from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
