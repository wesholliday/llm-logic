It means that if the shirt was made of cotton, then the pants were denim.\n\nCombining the two statements:\n- If the shirt was not cotton, then the second statement does not provide any information about the pants because the condition (shirt being cotton) is not met.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The pants were not denim\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
