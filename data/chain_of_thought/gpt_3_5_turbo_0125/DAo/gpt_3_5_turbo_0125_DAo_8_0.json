If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the vampire was not awake. \n\nNow, let's consider statement 2. This statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q.\" In this case, P is \"the vampire was awake\" and Q is \"the mummy was awake.\" \n\nSince we know that the vampire was not awake (from statement 1), the condition \"the vampire was awake\" is false. In a conditional statement, if the condition (P) is false, then the statement as a whole is considered true regardless of the truth value of Q.\n\nTherefore, if the vampire was not awake, the statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is considered true.\n\nGiven that the conditional statement is true and the vampire was not awake, we can infer that the mummy was indeed awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
