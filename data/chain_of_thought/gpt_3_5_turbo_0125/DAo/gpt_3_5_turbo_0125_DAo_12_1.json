The first statement implies that Joe did not go to the park. The second statement is a conditional statement, stating that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nGiven that we are told Joe did not go to the park, we cannot directly infer whether Lucy went to the zoo or not. It is because the second statement only gives information about what happens if Joe goes to the park, and we do not have any explicit information about what occurs if Joe does not go to the park.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we cannot definitively infer whether Lucy went to the zoo or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
