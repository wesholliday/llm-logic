From the conditional statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake,\" we have the contrapositive: ~Mummy --> ~Vampire.\n\nNow, if ~Vampire implies ~Mummy, then based on our initial inference that the vampire is not awake (so ~Vampire), we can conclude that the mummy is not awake as well (so ~Mummy).\n\nTherefore, the statement \"The mummy was not awake\" can be inferred based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
