It means that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. Since we know the car was not red, we cannot determine the color of the truck based on this statement alone.\n\nGiven that we cannot definitively determine the color of the truck from the information provided, we cannot infer that \"The truck was not blue.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
