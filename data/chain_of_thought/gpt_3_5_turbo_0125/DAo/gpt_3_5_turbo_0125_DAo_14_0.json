The contrapositive of \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" is \"If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\" \n\nCombining this contrapositive with the first statement \"The bear was not in the cave,\" we can infer that the wolf was not in the den. This is because if the bear was not in the cave, then according to the contrapositive, the wolf was not in the den.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the wolf was not in the den.\n\nAnswer: yes",
