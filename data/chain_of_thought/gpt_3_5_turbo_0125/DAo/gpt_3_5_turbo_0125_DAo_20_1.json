The first statement: 'The apple was not red' means the apple was a color other than red.\n2. The second statement: 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' is a conditional statement. It can be symbolized as: P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n3. Since the apple was not red (from the first premise), the antecedent (P) of the conditional is false.\n4. In classical logic, when the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the truth of the statement is considered vacuously true regardless of the consequent (Q).\n5.
