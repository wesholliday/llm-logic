It means that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer the following:\n\n- If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then the conditional statement does not apply. This means we cannot determine whether Mark bought the blue shirt or not based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
