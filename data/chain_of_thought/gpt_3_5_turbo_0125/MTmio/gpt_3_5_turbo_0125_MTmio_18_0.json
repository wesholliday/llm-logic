            "content": "First, let's break down the statements given:\n\n1. \"The truck might not have been metal\" - This statement suggests that the truck could be made of a material other than metal.\n\n2. \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\" - This statement sets up a conditional relationship between the doll and the truck. If the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal.\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications:\n\n- If the truck is not metal, then the doll cannot be plastic based on the second statement. This is because the second statement states that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. Since the truck might not have been metal (as per the first statement), the doll cannot be plastic.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
