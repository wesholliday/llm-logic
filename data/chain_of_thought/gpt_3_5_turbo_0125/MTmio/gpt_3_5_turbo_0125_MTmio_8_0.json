This implies that the mummy being awake is dependent on the vampire being awake.\n\nGiven these statements, we cannot definitively infer that the vampire was not awake. The information provided does not directly address the state of the vampire's wakefulness. It only establishes a relationship between the vampire and the mummy's wakefulness.\n\nAnswer: no",
