It states that if James wrote the book, then it must be a mystery novel.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer the following:\n\n- If the book is not a mystery novel, then it is not necessarily written by James. This is because the first statement allows for the book to not be a mystery novel, which means it could have been written by someone other than James.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the book was not necessarily written by James, but we cannot definitively conclude that it was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: no",
