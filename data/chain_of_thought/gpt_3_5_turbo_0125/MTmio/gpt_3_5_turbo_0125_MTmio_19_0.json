            "content": "To determine if we can infer that Tom did not watch football, let's break down the statements:\n\n1. \"Jen might not have watched basketball\" - This statement suggests that there is a possibility that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\n2. \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\" - This statement implies a conditional relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball. If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nGiven these two statements, if we assume that Jen did not watch basketball, then the second statement becomes false because it states that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. Since Jen did not watch basketball, it means Tom did not watch football because the condition for Jen watching basketball (Tom watching football) did not occur.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
