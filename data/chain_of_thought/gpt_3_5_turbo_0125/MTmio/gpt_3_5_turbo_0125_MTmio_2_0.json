            "content": "To determine if we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest, we need to analyze the statements given:\n\n1. \"The unicorn might not have been in the forest\" - This statement suggests that it is possible that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\n2. \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest\" - This statement is a conditional statement. It states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer the following:\n\n- If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin could not have been in the forest because if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest according to the second statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
