If Joe went to the park, it is certain that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nTaking these statements together, if Lucy might not have gone to the zoo and if Lucy must have gone to the zoo if Joe went to the park, it means that if Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe could not have gone to the park.

It means that if Joe went to the park, then it is necessary for Lucy to have gone to the zoo.\n\nGiven these two statements, let's consider the implications if Joe went to the park and if Lucy did not go to the zoo. If both statements are true, then we have a contradiction because the second statement implies Lucy must have gone to the zoo if Joe went to the park, but the first statement suggests Lucy might not have gone to the zoo. This contradiction implies that the assumption of Joe going to the park and Lucy not going to the zoo is not possible.\n\nTherefore, if we accept the statements as true, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park. \n\nAnswer: yes",
