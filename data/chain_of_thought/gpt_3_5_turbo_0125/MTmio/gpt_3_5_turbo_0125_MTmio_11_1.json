If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry. However, the first statement allows for the possibility that the muffins might not be blueberry. This means that if the muffins were not blueberry, it is still possible for the cake to be chocolate.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The cake was not chocolate\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
