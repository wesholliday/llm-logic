If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that Erin might not have taken a train, which means there is a possibility that Erin did not take a train.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. This means that if Sam took a plane, Erin definitely took a train.\n\nNow, if we combine these two statements, we can infer the following:\n\n- If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\n- If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
