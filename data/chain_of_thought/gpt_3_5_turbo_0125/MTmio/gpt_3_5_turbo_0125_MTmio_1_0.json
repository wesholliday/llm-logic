If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that Sue's presence at the wedding is uncertain. From statement 2, we can infer that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there. \n\nIf Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue's presence is uncertain as per statement 1. However, if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there according to statement 2. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer whether Mary was at the wedding based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
