It implies that if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If the cat might not have been outside, then it is possible that the cat was inside.\n- If the cat was inside, based on the second statement, the dog must have been outside.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
