This means that the presence of the bear in the cave implies the presence of the wolf in the den.\n\nIf we combine these two statements, we can conclude that since the wolf might not have been in the den, it is possible that the bear was not in the cave. This is because if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den, which contradicts the possibility that the wolf was not in the den.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes",
