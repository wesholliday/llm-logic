It states that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications of these statements:\n\n- If the truck might not have been blue, it means the truck could have been a different color.\n- If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. This means that if the car was red, the truck had to be blue.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that if the truck was not blue, then the car could not have been red. This is because if the car was red, the truck must have been blue according to the second statement. Since the first statement allows for the possibility of the truck not being blue, it means the car cannot be red.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The car was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
