It states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have also finished the race.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n- If Chris did not finish the race, then the first statement is true.\n- If the second statement is true (if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race), and we know that Chris might not have finished the race, then it implies that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
