We want to infer \"The bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nGiven the first statement indicates that the wolf might not have been in the den, we know that there is a possibility that the wolf wasn't in the den. \n\nThe second statement tells us that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den. This suggests a direct relationship between the bear being in the cave and the wolf being in the den. \n\nTherefore, if the wolf might not have been in the den as per the first statement, and the second statement links the bear being in the cave to the wolf being in the den, it implies that if the wolf wasn't in the den, then the bear couldn't have been in the cave. This leads to the inference that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nNow, consider the contrapositive of statement 2: If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave. This supports our inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",

This doesn't give a definite location for the wolf.\n\nStatement 2 is a conditional statement. It says that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den. This implies that if the bear was in the cave, the wolf definitely must have been in the den.\n\nIf we look at the two statements together, since we know the wolf might not have been in the den and that if the bear was in the cave the wolf must have been in the den, it implies that the bear was not in the cave. This is because if the bear was in the cave, the wolf would have had to be in the den according to statement 2, which contradicts the possibility that the wolf might not have been in the den according to statement 1.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that 'The bear was not in the cave.'\n\nAnswer: yes",
