            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'The apple was not red' from the given statements, let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. \"The banana might not have been yellow\" - This statement suggests that the color of the banana is uncertain. It could be yellow or another color.\n\n2. \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" - This statement establishes a conditional relationship between the colors of the apple and the banana. If the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If the banana is not yellow (as stated in the first statement), then the condition in the second statement (\"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\") cannot be met. This means that the apple cannot be red because it would require the banana to be yellow, which is not the case according to the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The apple was not red\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
