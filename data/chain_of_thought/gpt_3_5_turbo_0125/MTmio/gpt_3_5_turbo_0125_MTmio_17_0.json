If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n- If Ben did eat pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad according to the second statement.\n- However, the first statement suggests that there is a possibility that Kate did not eat salad.\n\nTherefore, if we assume that Kate might not have eaten salad, it contradicts the condition that Kate must have eaten salad if Ben ate pasta. This means that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
