            "content": "To determine if we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, let's break down the statements:\n\n1. \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt\" - This statement suggests that there is a possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\n2. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" - This statement implies a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. It states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, it means there is a possibility that he did not buy the blue shirt.\n- The second statement establishes a condition that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, if Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, and if Lisa buying the red shirt implies that Mark must have bought the blue shirt, it follows that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
