The new statement \"The crunk must quork gribble and quazzle quorple\" adds an additional action, quork gribble, to what the crunk must do. Therefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the original one because the new statement includes an action that was not mentioned in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
