The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of the first statement \"Sue \u2192 Bob\" is \"Not Bob \u2192 Not Sue.\"\n\nSo, if Bob did not choose pasta (Not Bob), then we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza (Not Sue) based on the contrapositive relationship.\n\nAnswer: yes",
