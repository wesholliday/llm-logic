            "content": "To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to consider the logical relationship between them. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball\". The second statement is the contrapositive of the first statement, which is logically equivalent.\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". In this case, the contrapositive of \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\".\n\nTherefore, based on the logical relationship between the two statements, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
