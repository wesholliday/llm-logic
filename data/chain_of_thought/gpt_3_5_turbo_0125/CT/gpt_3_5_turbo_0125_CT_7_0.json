The first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\" In this case, A is \"Alex finished the race\" and B is \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\nThe second statement is also a conditional statement, but the order of the subjects is reversed. It is of the form \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, B is \"Chris did not finish the race\" and A is \"Alex did not finish the race.\"\n\nTo infer the second statement from the first, we need to check if the contrapositive of the first statement is equivalent to the second statement. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nTherefore, if the contrapositive of the first statement is equivalent to the second statement, then we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nLet's check if the contrapositive of the first statement is equivalent to the second statement.",
