The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" \n\nGiven the original statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry,\" we can rewrite it as \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry\" to find the contrapositive.\n\nNow, the second statement \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\" is the contrapositive of the original statement. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
