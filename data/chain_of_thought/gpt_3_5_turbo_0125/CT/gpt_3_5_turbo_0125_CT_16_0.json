In this case, the original statement is: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of this statement would be: \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the contrapositive, we can infer 'If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton' from the original statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
