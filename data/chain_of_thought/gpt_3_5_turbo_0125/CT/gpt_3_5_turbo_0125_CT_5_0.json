This is because the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball' from the original statement 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
