The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement \"Ben ate pasta \u2192 Kate ate the salad\" is: \nNot Kate ate the salad \u2192 Not Ben ate pasta\n\nTherefore, based on the contrapositive of the original statement, we can infer that if Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
