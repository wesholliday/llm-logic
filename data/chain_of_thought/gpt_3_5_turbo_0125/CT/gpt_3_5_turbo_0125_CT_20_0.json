            "content": "To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to analyze the original statement logically. The original statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" can be represented as \"A implies B\" where A is the apple being red and B is the banana being yellow.\n\nTo infer the second statement \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red\", we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"A implies B\" is \"Not B implies not A\". In this case, \"Not B\" means the banana was not yellow, and \"not A\" means the apple was not red.\n\nTherefore, if the original statement holds true, its contrapositive should also hold true. This is because in a valid implication, the original statement and its contrapositive are equivalent.\n\nAnswer: yes",
