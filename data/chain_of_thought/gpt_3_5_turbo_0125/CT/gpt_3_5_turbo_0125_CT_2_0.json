The contrapositive of \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A.\" \n\nGiven the original statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest,\" we can rewrite it as \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\" This is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nNow, the second statement \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\" matches the contrapositive of the original statement. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
