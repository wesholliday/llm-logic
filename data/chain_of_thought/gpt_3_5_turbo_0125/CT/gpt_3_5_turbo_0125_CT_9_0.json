The contrapositive of 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. \n\nGiven the original statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt', the contrapositive would be 'If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt'. \n\nTherefore, the second statement can be inferred from the first statement. \n\nAnswer: yes",
