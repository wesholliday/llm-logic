The contrapositive of the statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A.' In this case, 'If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars' is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nHence, if the original statement 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter' is true, then the contrapositive statement 'If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars' must also be true.
