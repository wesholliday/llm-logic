The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\" The second statement is the contrapositive of the first statement, which is logically equivalent.\n\nIn a conditional statement \"If A, then B,\" the contrapositive is \"If not B, then not A.\" This means that if we know the first statement is true, then the second statement must also be true.\n\nTherefore, if we know that 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is true, then we can infer 'If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.'\n\nAnswer: yes",
