The contrapositive of a conditional statement switches the hypothesis and conclusion and negates them. So, for the original statement \"If p, then q,\" the contrapositive is \"If not q, then not p.\"\n\nIn this case, the original statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" can be rewritten as \"If p (shirt is cotton), then q (pants are denim).\" The contrapositive of this statement would be \"If not q (pants are not denim), then not p (shirt is not cotton).\"\n\nTherefore, from the original statement, we can infer \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton\" based on the contrapositive relationship. \n\nAnswer: yes",
