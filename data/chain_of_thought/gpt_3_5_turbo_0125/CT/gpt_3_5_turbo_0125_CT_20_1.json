            "content": "To determine if the statement \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red\" can be inferred from \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow,\" let's first analyze the original statement.\n\nThe original statement can be translated as: A implies B (If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow).\n\nTo infer the new statement, we need to determine if the contrapositive of A implies the contrapositive of B. The contrapositive of A implies B is -B implies -A, where -B stands for \"not B\" and -A stands for \"not A.\n\nGiven that the contrapositive of A implies B would be \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red,\" we need to now check if this contrapositive is true.\n\nIf \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red\" holds true, it would mean that if the banana was a color other than yellow, then the apple was a color other than red. This seems to align with the original statement where the apple being red implies the banana being yellow.\n\nTherefore, when considering the contrapositive, we see that \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red\" can indeed be inferred from the original statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
