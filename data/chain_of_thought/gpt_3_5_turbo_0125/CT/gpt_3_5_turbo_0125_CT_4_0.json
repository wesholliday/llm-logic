The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\" The second statement is the contrapositive of the first statement, which is logically equivalent.\n\nIn the first statement, \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter,\" we can represent it as A -> B, where A is \"the alien visited Mars\" and B is \"the robot visited Jupiter.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of A -> B is ~B -> ~A, which means \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, it would be \"If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\"\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer \"If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars\" from the original statement.",
