However, it does not necessarily mean the inverse: that if Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nIn propositional logic, the inverse of a conditional statement may not always be true. The inverse of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the inverse would be \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\"\n\nTo determine if the given statement is valid, we need to consider the truth value of the original conditional statement. Since we do not have information about whether Jeff played basketball or not, we cannot definitively conclude that if Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\" from the original statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
