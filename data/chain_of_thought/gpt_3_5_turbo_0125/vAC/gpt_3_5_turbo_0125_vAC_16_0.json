The argument is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If A, then B.\" The first premise states that if the shirt was cotton (A), then the pants were denim (B). The second premise states that the pants were denim (B). From these premises, we can infer that the shirt was cotton (A).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid based on the rules of deductive reasoning. \n\nAnswer: yes",
