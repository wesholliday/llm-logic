If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n2. The wolf was in the den.\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer that the wolf being in the den implies that the bear was in the cave. This is because the first premise establishes a conditional relationship between the bear being in the cave and the wolf being in the den. If the wolf was in the den (as stated in the second premise), then according to the first premise, it must be the case that the bear was in the cave.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
