            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze it using the rules of deductive reasoning. The argument is structured as a conditional statement in the first premise and an affirmation in the second premise. \n\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. (Conditional statement)\n2. The mummy was awake. (Affirmation)\n3. Conclusion: The vampire was awake.\n\nGiven the premises, if we assume that the first premise is true (If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake) and the second premise is true (The mummy was awake), then the conclusion (The vampire was awake) logically follows based on the conditional statement. This is because if the mummy was awake (as stated in the second premise) and the conditional statement holds true (as stated in the first premise), then it logically follows that the vampire must also be awake.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
