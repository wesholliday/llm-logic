The argument is structured as a conditional statement in the first premise and an affirmation of the consequent in the second premise. \n\n1. If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. (Conditional statement)\n2. Erin took a train. (Affirmation of the consequent)\n\nFrom these premises, we cannot definitively conclude that Sam took a plane. The argument does not provide enough information to establish a direct link between Sam taking a plane and Erin taking a train. It is possible that Erin took a train for a different reason unrelated to Sam taking a plane.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: no",
