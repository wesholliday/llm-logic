The first premise states: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n2. The second premise states: \"The banana was yellow.\"\n\nGiven these premises, we can see that the argument does not provide enough information to conclude that the apple was red. The first premise only establishes a conditional relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana, but it does not specify the actual color of the apple. The second premise tells us the color of the banana, but it does not give us any information about the color of the apple.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The apple was red\" cannot be logically inferred from the premises provided. \n\nAnswer: no",
