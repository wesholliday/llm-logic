The argument is structured as a conditional statement in the first premise, and an affirmation of the consequent in the second premise. \n\n1. If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. (Conditional statement)\n2. The unicorn was in the forest. (Affirmation of the consequent)\n\nFrom these premises, we cannot definitively conclude that the griffin was in the forest. The first premise only establishes a relationship between the griffin and the unicorn, but it does not provide direct information about the griffin's location. The second premise tells us about the unicorn's location, but it does not necessarily imply anything about the griffin.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.",
