The argument is structured as a conditional statement in the first premise and an affirmation of the consequent in the second premise. \n\n1. If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. (Conditional statement)\n2. The robot visited Jupiter. (Affirmation of the consequent)\n\nFrom these premises, we cannot definitively conclude that the alien visited Mars. The argument does not provide enough information to establish a direct link between the robot visiting Jupiter and the alien visiting Mars. The conclusion 'The alien visited Mars' goes beyond what can be logically inferred from the premises given.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: no",
