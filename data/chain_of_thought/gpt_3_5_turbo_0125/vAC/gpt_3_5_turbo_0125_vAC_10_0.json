The argument is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If A, then B\" (If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside). The second premise states that B is true (The cat was outside). From these premises, we can infer that A must also be true (The dog was inside) based on the given conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises according to the rules of deductive reasoning.",
