The argument is in the form of a hypothetical syllogism, which states that if the first premise is true and the second premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true. In this case, the first premise states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. The second premise states that the muffins were blueberry. Therefore, based on the given premises, the conclusion that the cake was chocolate logically follows. \n\nAnswer: yes",
