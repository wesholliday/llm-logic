The argument is in the form of a hypothetical syllogism, which states that if the antecedent of the first premise is true, then the consequent of the first premise is also true. Given that the second premise affirms the consequent of the first premise, we can infer that the antecedent of the first premise is true. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
