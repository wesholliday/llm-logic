The argument is structured as a conditional statement in the first premise and an affirmation in the second premise. \n\n1. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta (Premise)\n2. Bob chose pasta (Premise)\n3. Sue chose pizza (Conclusion)\n\nGiven the premises, if we assume that the first premise is true (If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta) and the second premise is true (Bob chose pasta), then the conclusion (Sue chose pizza) logically follows. This is because if the first premise is true and Bob indeed chose pasta (as stated in the second premise), then it logically implies that Sue must have chosen pizza. \n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
