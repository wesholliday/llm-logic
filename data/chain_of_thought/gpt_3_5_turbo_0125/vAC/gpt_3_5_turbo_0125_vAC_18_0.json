The argument is structured as a conditional statement in the first premise, which states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. The second premise affirms that the truck was metal. From these premises, we can infer that the doll must have been plastic based on the conditional relationship established in the first premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises given the conditional relationship between the doll and the truck.",
