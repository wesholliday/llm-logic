The first premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. The second premise states that Mark bought the blue shirt. From these two premises, we can infer that Lisa bought the red shirt, based on the first premise. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
