The argument is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If A, then B\" (premise 1), and it is given that B is true (premise 2). From these premises, we cannot definitively conclude that A is true. This is because the truth of B does not necessarily imply the truth of A in a conditional statement. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: no",
