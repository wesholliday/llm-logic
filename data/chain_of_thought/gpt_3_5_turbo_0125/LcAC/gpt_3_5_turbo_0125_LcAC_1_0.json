If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n2. Sue was at the wedding.\n\nGiven these statements, we know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. Since we are told that Sue was indeed at the wedding, it follows that Mary must have been at the wedding as well. This is because the first statement establishes a conditional relationship between Mary and Sue's presence at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can logically conclude that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
