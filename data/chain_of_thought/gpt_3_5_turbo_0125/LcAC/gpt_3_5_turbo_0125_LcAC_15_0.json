Erin took a train.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. Since the second statement tells us that Erin took a train, we can infer that the first part of the conditional statement is true (Erin took a train). However, we cannot definitively conclude that Sam took a plane because the conditional statement does not provide information about what happens if Erin did not take a train.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that Sam took a plane based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
