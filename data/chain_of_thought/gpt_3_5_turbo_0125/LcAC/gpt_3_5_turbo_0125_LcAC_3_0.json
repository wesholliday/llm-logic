However, from this information alone, we cannot definitively conclude that A is true (the book was written by James). This is because the conditional statement only tells us what happens if A is true, but it does not tell us anything about what happens if A is false.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we cannot logically conclude that the book was written by James.\n\nAnswer: no",
