However, this does not necessarily mean that the cake must be chocolate if the muffins were blueberry. The statement only establishes a relationship between the cake being chocolate and the muffins being blueberry.\n\nGiven the second statement that the muffins were blueberry, we know that the muffins were indeed blueberry. However, this information alone does not provide a direct link to the flavor of the cake.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot logically conclude that the cake was chocolate. \n\nAnswer: no",
