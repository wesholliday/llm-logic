However, this does not necessarily mean that the griffin must be in the forest. It only establishes a relationship between the griffin and the unicorn's locations.\n\nGiven that the second statement confirms that the unicorn was in the forest, we can conclude that the unicorn was indeed in the forest. But we cannot definitively determine the location of the griffin based on the information provided. The griffin could be in the forest or elsewhere, as the first statement only establishes a conditional relationship between the griffin and the unicorn's locations.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that the griffin was in the forest based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
