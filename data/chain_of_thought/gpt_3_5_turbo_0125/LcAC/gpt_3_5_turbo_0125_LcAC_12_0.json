Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nGiven these statements, we know that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. Since we also know that Lucy went to the zoo, it does not necessarily mean that Joe went to the park. Lucy going to the zoo does not provide any information about Joe's location. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that Joe went to the park based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
