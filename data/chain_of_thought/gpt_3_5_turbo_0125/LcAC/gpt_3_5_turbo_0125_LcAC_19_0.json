The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This means that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if Tom did not watch football.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"Jen watched basketball.\" This statement tells us that Jen watched basketball.\n\nGiven these statements, we cannot logically conclude that Tom watched football. The first statement only tells us what happens if Tom watched football, but it does not provide any information about what happens if Tom did not watch football. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine whether Tom watched football based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
