It does not directly tell us whether Ben ate pasta or not, but it establishes a relationship between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating salad. If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\n\n2. \"Kate ate salad\" - This statement tells us that Kate ate salad.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can conclude the following:\n- If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\n- Kate ate salad.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively conclude that Ben ate pasta based on the given information. Just because Kate ate salad does not necessarily mean that Ben ate pasta. Kate could have eaten salad for reasons unrelated to Ben eating pasta. \n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that Ben ate pasta based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
