It does not provide any information about what Sue actually chose.\n\n2. \"Bob chose pasta\" - This statement directly tells us that Bob chose pasta.\n\nGiven these statements, we cannot definitively conclude what Sue chose. The first statement only tells us about the relationship between Sue and Bob's choices, not Sue's actual choice. Therefore, even though Bob chose pasta, we cannot determine what Sue chose based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
