The contrapositive of \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\" \n\nGiven that the mummy was awake, according to the second statement, we can conclude that the contrapositive holds true: the mummy was not not awake (i.e., the mummy was awake), so the vampire was not not awake (i.e., the vampire was awake). Therefore, we can logically conclude that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
