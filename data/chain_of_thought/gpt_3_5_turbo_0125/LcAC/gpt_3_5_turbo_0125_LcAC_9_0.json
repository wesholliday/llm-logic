The second statement tells us that Mark indeed bought the blue shirt.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt based on the given information. The first statement only establishes a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. It does not provide any information about what happens if Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
