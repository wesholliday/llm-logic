The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be represented as: Jeff \u2192 Amy.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"Amy played tennis.\" This can be represented as: Amy.\n\nGiven these statements, we know that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. We also know that Amy played tennis. However, we cannot definitively conclude that Jeff played basketball based on the information provided. This is because the conditional statement only tells us what happens if Jeff played basketball, but it does not provide any information about what happens if Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that Jeff played basketball based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
