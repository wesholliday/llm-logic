However, this does not mean that the doll must be plastic if the truck is metal. The statement only tells us about one direction of the relationship between the doll and the truck.\n\nGiven that the second statement tells us that the truck was metal, we cannot definitively conclude that the doll was plastic. The doll could still be made of a different material other than plastic.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that the doll was plastic based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
