If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\n2. It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den.\n\nFrom statement 1, if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den. However, from statement 2, it's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den. This means that the wolf was not necessarily in the den.\n\nGiven this information, we cannot definitively infer that the bear was not in the cave. The bear could still be in the cave even if the wolf was not in the den.\n\nAnswer: no",
