It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nNow, we need to analyze the logic:\n\n- If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. Since the statement is conditional, we can represent it as: Tom watched football -> Jen watched basketball.\n- It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. This can be represented as: ~Jen watched basketball.\n\nPutting both statements together:\n\n- If Tom watched football (T), then Jen watched basketball (B): T -> B\n- But it's not the case that Jen watched basketball: ~B\n\nNow, if we know that T -> B and ~B, we can infer ~T (Tom did not watch football) using the contrapositive of T -> B, which is ~B -> ~T.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the question, we can infer that Tom did not watch football. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
