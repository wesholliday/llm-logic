It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\n\nFrom statement 1, if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. This tells us that if the shirt was cotton, the pants were denim as well. \n\nFrom statement 2, it's not the case that the pants must have been denim. This implies that the pants were not necessarily denim.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer the following:\n- If the shirt was cotton (based on the first statement), then the pants must have been denim.\n- But, since it's not the case that the pants must have been denim (second statement), the conclusion is that the shirt was not necessarily cotton.\n\nPutting it all together, we can infer that the shirt was not necessarily cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
