It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\n\nFrom statement 1, if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. However, statement 2 tells us that it's not the case that the truck must have been blue. This means that the car cannot be red, because if it were red, the truck would have to be blue according to statement 1, which contradicts statement 2.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
