If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\n2. It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. However, from statement 2, we are told that it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. This means that Sue may or may not have been at the wedding.\n\nSince we don't have definitive information about Sue's presence at the wedding, we cannot conclusively infer whether Mary was at the wedding or not based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
