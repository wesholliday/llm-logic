It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\n\nFrom statement 1, if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. However, from statement 2, it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow. This means that the condition in statement 1 is not satisfied.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the apple was not red because if it were red, the banana would have had to be yellow, which contradicts the information given.\n\nAnswer: yes",
