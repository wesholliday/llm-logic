It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. This means the robot's visit to Jupiter is dependent on the alien's visit to Mars.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that it's not necessary for the robot to have visited Jupiter. This contradicts the first statement, which says the robot must have visited Jupiter if the alien visited Mars.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can conclude that the robot did not visit Jupiter. Since the robot did not visit Jupiter, we cannot infer anything about the alien's visit to Mars. The alien may or may not have visited Mars.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: no",
