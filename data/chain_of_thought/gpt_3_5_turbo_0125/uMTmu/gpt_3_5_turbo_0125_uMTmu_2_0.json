If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\n2. It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\n\nFrom statement 1, if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest. However, statement 2 tells us that the unicorn must not have been in the forest. This means that the griffin cannot be in the forest because if it were, the unicorn would have to be there as well, which contradicts the fact that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
