It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake. However, from statement 2, we are told that it's not the case that the mummy must have been awake. This means that the mummy could have been asleep.\n\nGiven this information, we cannot definitively infer that the vampire was not awake. The mummy's state of being awake or asleep does not provide enough information to determine the state of the vampire.\n\nAnswer: no",
