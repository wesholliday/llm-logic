It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if James wrote the book, then it must be a mystery novel. This means that all books written by James are mystery novels.\n\nFrom statement 2, we are given that it's not necessary for the book to be a mystery novel. This contradicts the first statement, which stated that if James wrote the book, it must be a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
