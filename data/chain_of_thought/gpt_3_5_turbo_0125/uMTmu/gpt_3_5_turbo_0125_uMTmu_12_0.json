It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nFrom statement 1, if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. However, from statement 2, it's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This means that the condition in statement 1 is not satisfied, so we cannot conclude that Joe went to the park.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: no",
