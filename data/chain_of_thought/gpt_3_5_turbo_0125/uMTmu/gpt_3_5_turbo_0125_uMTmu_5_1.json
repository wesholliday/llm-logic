From this, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball. This can be reasoned as follows:\n\n1. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\n2. It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\n3. If Jeff played basketball and Amy must have played tennis, it would contradict the fact that Amy must not have played tennis.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: Yes",

It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis. (~Amy)\n\nNow, let's analyze the statement. If Amy did not play tennis, then the first statement's condition is not met, meaning Jeff did not play basketball (Jeff). This is because the first statement asserts that if Jeff plays basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. Since Amy did not play tennis, it means Jeff cannot have played basketball.
