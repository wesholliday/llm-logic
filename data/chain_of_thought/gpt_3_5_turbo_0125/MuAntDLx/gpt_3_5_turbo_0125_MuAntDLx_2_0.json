The statement \"The flump must be on the plonk or in the glorp\" does not specify that the flump cannot be in the glorp. It only states that the flump must be either on the plonk or in the glorp. Therefore, we cannot infer that the flump must be on the plonk based on this statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
