Since the question asks if we can infer \"The fizzle might be crunk zibber\", we can only infer this if \"crunk zibber\" is one of the possibilities mentioned in the original statement. Therefore, if \"crunk zibber\" is one of the possibilities, we can infer \"The fizzle might be crunk zibber\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
