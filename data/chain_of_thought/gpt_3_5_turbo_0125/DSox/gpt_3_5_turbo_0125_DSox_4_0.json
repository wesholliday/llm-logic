From the statement \"The fribble is not crinked,\" we know that the fribble cannot be crinked.\n2. From the statement \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it is crinked,\" we know that the fribble is either snurgled or crinked.\n\nSince we know the fribble is not crinked, the only remaining possibility is that it is snurgled. Therefore, we can infer that \"The fribble is snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
