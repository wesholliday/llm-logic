Assume \"The splat is not morphed\" is true.\n2. From the statement \"Either the splat is morphed or it is quanked\", if the splat is not morphed, then it must be quanked.\n3. However, the first statement says \"The splat is not quanked\", which contradicts the assumption made in step 2.\n4. Therefore, the assumption that \"The splat is not morphed\" leads to a contradiction.\n5. Hence, we can infer that \"The splat is morphed\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and the logical reasoning above, we can infer that \"The splat is morphed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
