Let's assume that 'The flug is not blummed'.\n2. From the second statement, 'Either the flug is blummed or it is zimmed', we know that the flug must be either blummed or zimmed.\n3. Since we have assumed that 'The flug is not blummed', it must be zimmed.\n4. However, the first statement says 'The flug is not zimmed', which contradicts our assumption that the flug is zimmed.\n5. Therefore, our initial assumption that 'The flug is not blummed' must be false, and the only remaining possibility is that 'The flug is blummed'.\n\nBased on this logical reasoning, we can infer that 'The flug is blummed'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
