From the statement \"The grommet is not plopped\" and \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it is plopped\", we know that the grommet is not plopped. This means the grommet must be sploffed based on the second statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The grommet is sploffed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
