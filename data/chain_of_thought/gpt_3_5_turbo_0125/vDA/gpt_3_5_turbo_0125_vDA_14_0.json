The first premise states \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den,\" which can be represented as: Bear in cave \u2192 Wolf in den.\n\nThe second premise states \"The bear was not in the cave,\" which can be represented as: \u00ac(Bear in cave).\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer that the wolf was not in the den by modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
