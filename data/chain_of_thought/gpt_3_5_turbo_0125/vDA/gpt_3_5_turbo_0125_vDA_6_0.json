Sue did not choose pizza. (Premise)\n\nFrom the first premise, we can infer the contrapositive: If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza. This is based on the logical equivalence between a conditional statement and its contrapositive.\n\n3. If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza. (Contrapositive of premise 1)\n\nNow, combining this with premise 2, we can see that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta. This is a valid inference based on the contrapositive relationship established earlier.\n\n4. Bob did not choose pasta. (Conclusion)\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
