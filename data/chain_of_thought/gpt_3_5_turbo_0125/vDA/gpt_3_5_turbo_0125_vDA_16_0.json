            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze it using the rules of deductive reasoning. The argument is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If A, then B.\" The first premise states that if the shirt was cotton (A), then the pants were denim (B). The second premise states that the shirt was not cotton, which means the antecedent of the conditional statement is false. \n\nIn classical logic, if the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the truth value of the statement as a whole is considered to be true. This is known as the principle of material implication. Therefore, if the shirt was not cotton (A is false), the conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is considered true regardless of the truth value of B.\n\nGiven that the conditional statement is considered true when the antecedent is false, the conclusion that the pants were not denim (B is false) logically follows from the premises. This is because if the antecedent of the conditional statement is false, the consequent can be either true or false without affecting the truth value of the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
