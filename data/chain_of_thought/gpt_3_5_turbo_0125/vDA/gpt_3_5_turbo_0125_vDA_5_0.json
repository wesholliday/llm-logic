            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze it using the rules of inference. The argument can be represented symbolically as follows:\n\n1. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. (Premise)\n2. Jeff did not play basketball. (Premise)\n3. Therefore, Amy did not play tennis. (Conclusion)\n\nWe can break down the argument as follows:\n\n- Let's assume the premise \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is true. This can be represented as J \u2192 A.\n- The second premise states that Jeff did not play basketball, which can be represented as \u00acJ.\n\nNow, if we combine the first premise and the second premise, we get:\n\n- \u00acJ \u2192 \u00acA (By the contrapositive of J \u2192 A)\n\nTherefore, based on the premises given, the conclusion \"Amy did not play tennis\" logically follows. This argument is valid because the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
