If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. (Premise)\n2. Lisa did not buy the red shirt. (Premise)\n\nFrom the first premise, we can infer that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then it does not necessarily mean that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. The absence of Lisa buying the red shirt does not directly imply anything about Mark buying the blue shirt. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
