The first premise states: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be represented as: If A, then B (A -> B).\n\n2. The second premise states: \"The apple was not red.\" This can be represented as: Not A (~A).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The banana was not yellow.\" This can be represented as: Not B (~B).\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\n- If the apple was red (A), then the banana was yellow (B). (A -> B)\n- The apple was not red (~A).\n\nFrom the premises, we cannot definitively conclude that the banana was not yellow (~B) because the first premise does not provide a direct link between the color of the apple and the color of the banana when the apple is not red. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
