The first premise states: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This can be represented as: Ben ate pasta \u2192 Kate ate salad.\n\n2. The second premise states: \"Ben did not eat pasta.\" This can be represented as: \u00acBen ate pasta.\n\n3. From the first premise, we know that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. Since Ben did not eat pasta (\u00acBen ate pasta), we cannot conclude anything about Kate eating salad based on this premise alone.\n\n4. Therefore, the conclusion \"Kate did not eat salad\" cannot be logically derived from the given premises. \n\nBased on this analysis, the argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: no",
