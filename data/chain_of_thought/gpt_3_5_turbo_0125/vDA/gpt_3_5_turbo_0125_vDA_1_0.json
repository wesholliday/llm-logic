The first premise states: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n2. The second premise states: \"Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nFrom the first premise, we can infer that if Mary was not at the wedding, then we cannot make any conclusions about Sue being at the wedding or not. The premise only provides information about Sue's presence if Mary was at the wedding.\n\nGiven that the second premise states that Mary was not at the wedding, we cannot logically conclude anything about Sue's presence at the wedding based on the information provided. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
