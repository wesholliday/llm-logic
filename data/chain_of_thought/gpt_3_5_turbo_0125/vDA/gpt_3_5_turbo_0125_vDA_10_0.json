If D -> C (If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside)\n2. ~D (The dog was not inside)\n3. \u2234 ~C (The cat was not outside)\n\nWe can use the rule of Modus Tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement and the negation of the consequent, we can infer the negation of the antecedent. In this case, we have the conditional statement 'If D, then C' and the negation of C (~C), so we can infer the negation of D (~D).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
