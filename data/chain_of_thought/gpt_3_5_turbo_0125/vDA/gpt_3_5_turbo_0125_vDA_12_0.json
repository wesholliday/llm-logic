The first premise states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. The second premise states that Joe did not go to the park. From these premises, we can infer that Lucy did not necessarily go to the zoo, as the first premise only establishes a condition if Joe went to the park.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion 'Lucy did not go to the zoo' does not necessarily follow from the premises provided.",
