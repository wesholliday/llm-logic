(Premise)\n2. The doll was not plastic. (Premise)\n\nFrom the first premise, we can infer the contrapositive: If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic. This is a valid logical inference based on the contrapositive rule.\n\nGiven that the doll was not plastic (second premise), we can conclude that the truck was not metal based on the contrapositive of the first premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
