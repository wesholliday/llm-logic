If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. (Premise)\n2. The book was not written by James. (Premise)\n\nFrom these premises, we can see that the argument is structured as a modus tollens form of reasoning, which is a valid deductive argument form. Modus tollens is a valid argument form that states if the consequent of a conditional statement is false, then the antecedent must also be false.\n\nTherefore, based on the premises given, the conclusion 'The book is not a mystery novel' logically follows from the premises using the modus tollens form of reasoning.\n\nAnswer: yes",
