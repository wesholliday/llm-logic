The argument is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If A, then B.\" The first premise states \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue,\" which can be represented as \"If car = red, then truck = blue.\"\n\nThe second premise states \"The car was not red,\" which can be represented as \"car \u2260 red.\" \n\nFrom the first premise, we can infer the contrapositive: \"If truck \u2260 blue, then car \u2260 red.\" \n\nGiven that the car is not red (car \u2260 red), we can conclude that the truck was not blue (truck \u2260 blue) based on the contrapositive of the first premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
