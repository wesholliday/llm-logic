(Premise)\n2. The alien did not visit Mars. (Premise)\n3. Therefore, the robot did not visit Jupiter. (Conclusion)\n\nBy examining the premises and conclusion, we can see that the argument follows the form of modus tollens, which is a valid form of deductive reasoning. Modus tollens states that if a conditional statement is true and the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false. In this case, the conditional statement is \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter,\" the consequent \"The alien did not visit Mars\" is true, so the antecedent \"The robot did not visit Jupiter\" must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
