(Premise)\n2. The vampire was not awake. (Premise)\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer the contrapositive: If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake. This is a valid logical inference based on the contrapositive rule.\n\nGiven that the vampire was not awake (premise 2), we can conclude from the contrapositive that the mummy was not awake. This conclusion follows logically from the premises and the contrapositive inference.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
