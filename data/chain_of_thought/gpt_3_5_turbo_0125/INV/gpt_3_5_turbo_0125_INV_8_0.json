The original statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" can be represented as: \n\nVampire awake -> Mummy awake\n\nTo infer the second statement \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake\", we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement switches the hypothesis and conclusion and negates both. \n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement is: \n\nNot Mummy awake -> Not Vampire awake\n\nTherefore, we cannot directly infer the second statement from the first statement. The contrapositive of the original statement does not match the second statement. \n\nAnswer: no",
