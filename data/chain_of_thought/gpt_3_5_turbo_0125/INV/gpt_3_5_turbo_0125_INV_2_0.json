            "content": "To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to consider the logical form of the original statement. The original statement is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If A, then B.\" In this case, A is \"the griffin was in the forest\" and B is \"the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" Therefore, if we take the contrapositive of the original statement, we get: \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nNow, the second statement you are asking about is: \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\" This matches the contrapositive of the original statement. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
