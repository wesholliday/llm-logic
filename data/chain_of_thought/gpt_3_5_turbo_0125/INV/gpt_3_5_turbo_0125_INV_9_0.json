            "content": "To determine if the second statement can be inferred from the first, we need to consider the logical relationship between them. The first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\" In this case, A is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and B is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThe second statement is the contrapositive of the first statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the contrapositive of the first statement would be \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\nTo determine if the second statement can be inferred from the first, we need to check if the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. In classical logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. Therefore, if the first statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
