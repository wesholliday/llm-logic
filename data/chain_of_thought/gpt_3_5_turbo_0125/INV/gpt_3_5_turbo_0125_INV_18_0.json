The contrapositive of a conditional statement switches the hypothesis and conclusion and negates both. \n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement is: \nNot Truck (metal) \u2192 Not Doll (plastic)\n\nTherefore, we can infer the statement \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal\" from the original statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
