            "content": "To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to consider the logical relationship between them. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q.\" In this case, P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball.\" \n\nThe second statement is the contrapositive of the first statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" \n\nTherefore, if we take the contrapositive of the first statement, it would be \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\" \n\nSo, the second statement \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball\" is not directly inferable from the first statement. \n\nAnswer: no",
