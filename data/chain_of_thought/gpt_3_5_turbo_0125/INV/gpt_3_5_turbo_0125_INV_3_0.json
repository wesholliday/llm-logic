The first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q.\" The second statement is the contrapositive of the first statement, which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" In this case, the contrapositive of the first statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" would be \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\"\n\nTherefore, the second statement \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel\" is the contrapositive of the first statement and can be inferred from it.\n\nAnswer: yes",
