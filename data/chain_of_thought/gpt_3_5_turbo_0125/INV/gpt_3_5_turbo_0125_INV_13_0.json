            "content": "To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to consider the logical relationship between them. The first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q.\" In this case, P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\" The second statement is also a conditional statement, but with the negation of P and Q. \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" If we apply this concept to the first statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue,\" the contrapositive would be \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the contrapositive relationship, we can infer the second statement \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue\" from the first statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
