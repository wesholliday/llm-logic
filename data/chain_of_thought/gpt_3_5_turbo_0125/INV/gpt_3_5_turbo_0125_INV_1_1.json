The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement where the antecedent is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and the consequent is \"Sue was at the wedding\".\n\n2. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A.\"\n\n3.
