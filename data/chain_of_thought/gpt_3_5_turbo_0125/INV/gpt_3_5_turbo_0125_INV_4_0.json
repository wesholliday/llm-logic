The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\" The second statement is the contrapositive of the first statement, which is logically equivalent.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" Therefore, if we have the conditional statement \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter,\" its contrapositive would be \"If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\"\n\nGiven this logical relationship, we can infer the second statement from the first if we assume the contrapositive relationship holds true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
