The contrapositive of \"Dog inside \u2192 Cat outside\" is \"\u00ac(Cat outside) \u2192 \u00ac(Dog inside).\"\n\nComparing the contrapositive to the negation of the original statement, we see that they are not equivalent. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no",
