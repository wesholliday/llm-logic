            "content": "To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. The original statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q.\" In this case, P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nThe second statement is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" In this case, the contrapositive of the original statement would be \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\nTo determine if the contrapositive is true, we need to consider the logical relationship between the original statement and its contrapositive. In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, if we know that \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is true, then we can infer that \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
