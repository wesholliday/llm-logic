The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q.\" The second statement is the contrapositive of the first statement, which is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if the first statement is true, then the second statement must also be true. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
