The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement \"Jeff played basketball \u2192 Amy played tennis\" is: \nNot Amy played tennis \u2192 Not Jeff played basketball\n\nTherefore, based on the contrapositive relationship, if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\n\nAnswer: yes",
