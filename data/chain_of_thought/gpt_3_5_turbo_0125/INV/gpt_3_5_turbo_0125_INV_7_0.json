The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q.\" The second statement is the contrapositive of the first statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of the first statement would be \"If Chris didn't finish the race, then Alex didn't finish the race.\" This is not the same as the second statement provided, which is \"If Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race.\"\n\nTherefore, we cannot directly infer the second statement from the first statement without additional information or logical steps.\n\nAnswer: no",
