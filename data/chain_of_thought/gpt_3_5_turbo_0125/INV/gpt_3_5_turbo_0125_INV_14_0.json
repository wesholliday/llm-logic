The original statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\" The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" is \"If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\" \n\nTherefore, we cannot directly infer the statement \"If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den\" from the original statement.
