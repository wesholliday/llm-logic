The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim' is: \nNot Pants (not denim) \u2192 Not Shirt (not cotton)\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim' from the original statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
