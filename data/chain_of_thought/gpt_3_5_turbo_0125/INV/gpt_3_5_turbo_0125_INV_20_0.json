The original statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q.\" The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\" \n\nTherefore, we can infer the statement \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow\" from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: yes",
