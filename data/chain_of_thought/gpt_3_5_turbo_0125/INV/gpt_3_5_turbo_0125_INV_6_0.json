The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q.\" In this case, P is \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q is \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" Therefore, if we take the contrapositive of the first statement, we get \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n\nGiven this, we cannot directly infer the second statement \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta\" from the original statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" The contrapositive of the original statement does not match the second statement exactly.",
