The original statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" can be represented as: \n\nP: Mary was at the wedding\nQ: Sue was at the wedding\n\nThe original statement can be written as P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q).\n\nTo infer the second statement \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\" from the original statement, we would need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP (If not Q, then not P).\n\nTherefore, to infer the second statement from the first, we need to check if the contrapositive holds true based on the original statement. \n\nAnswer: no",
