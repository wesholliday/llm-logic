If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n2. The griffin was not in the forest.\n\nFrom the first statement, if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was also in the forest. However, the second statement tells us that the griffin was not in the forest. Since the griffin was not in the forest, we cannot conclude anything about the unicorn's location based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no",
