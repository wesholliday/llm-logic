Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. Since Mary was not at the wedding, we cannot make any conclusions about Sue's presence at the wedding based on the information given. Sue could have been at the wedding or not, as the first statement does not apply in this case.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Sue was not at the wedding based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
