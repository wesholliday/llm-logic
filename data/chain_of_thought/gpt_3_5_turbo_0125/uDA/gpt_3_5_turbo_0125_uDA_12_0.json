Joe did not go to the park.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that Joe did not go to the park. Therefore, the first statement does not apply to Joe. Since Joe did not go to the park, we cannot make any conclusions about Lucy going to the zoo based on the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
