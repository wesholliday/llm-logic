The cake was not chocolate.\n\nFrom the first statement, if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. Since the cake was not chocolate (as per the second statement), we cannot determine the flavor of the muffins based on the given information. The muffins could be blueberry or another flavor since the condition for the muffins being blueberry was dependent on the cake being chocolate, which is not the case here.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nAnswer: no",
