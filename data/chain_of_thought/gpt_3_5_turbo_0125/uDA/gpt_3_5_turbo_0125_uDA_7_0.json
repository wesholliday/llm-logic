(Given)\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that Alex did not finish the race. Since the first statement says that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race, and we know that Alex did not finish the race, we can conclude that Chris did not necessarily finish the race. Chris could have finished the race or not finished it, as the first statement does not provide any information about Chris's status independent of Alex's status.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Chris did not finish the race based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
