This is a conditional statement that can be written as: Tom watched football -> Jen watched basketball.\n\n2. Tom did not watch football. This means the antecedent of the conditional statement is false.\n\nNow, let's consider the contrapositive of the conditional statement: If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football. Since we know Tom did not watch football, this means Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we can infer that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
