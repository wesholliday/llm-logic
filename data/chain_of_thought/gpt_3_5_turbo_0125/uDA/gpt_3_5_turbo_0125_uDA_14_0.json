The bear was not in the cave.\n\nFrom the first statement, if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. However, we know that the bear was not in the cave. This means we cannot determine the location of the wolf based on the information given. The wolf could still be in the den or not in the den, as the first statement does not apply in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the wolf was not in the den.\n\nAnswer: no",
