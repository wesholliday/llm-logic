The statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table\" tells us that one of these two conditions must be true.\n2. The statement \"The book isn't resting on the table\" rules out the possibility of the book resting on the table.\n3. Since the book cannot be resting on the table, based on the first statement, the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
