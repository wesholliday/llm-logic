The first statement is a disjunction (OR statement): \"Either the shoes are in the closet or they are lined up by the door.\"\n2. The second statement is a negation of the second part of the disjunction: \"The shoes aren't lined up by the door.\"\n\nGiven these statements, if the shoes are not lined up by the door, then the first part of the disjunction must be true according to the logical structure of the OR statement. Therefore, we can infer that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
