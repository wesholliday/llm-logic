The second statement is: \"The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet.\"\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer the following:\n- If the umbrella is not tucked away in the closet, then it must be in the car or somewhere else.\n- Since the first statement says the umbrella is either in the car or in the closet, and we know it's not in the closet, then it must be in the car.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The umbrella is in the car.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
