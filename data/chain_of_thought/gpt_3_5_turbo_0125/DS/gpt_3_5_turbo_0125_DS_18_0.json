The first statement is \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand.\" This means that the notebook is in one of these two locations.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand.\" This tells us that the notebook is not on the nightstand.\n\n3. Combining the two statements, we know that the notebook is not on the nightstand, so it must be in the drawer based on the first statement.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer that \"The notebook is in the drawer\" based on the given statements. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
