The scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n2. The scarf is draped on the coat rack.\n\nSince we know that the scarf isn't draped on the coat rack, we can eliminate the second possibility. This leaves us with only one possibility from the first statement:\n- The scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
