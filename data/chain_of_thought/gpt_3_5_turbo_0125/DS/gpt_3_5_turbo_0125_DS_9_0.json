The first statement is: \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it is blending in on the floor.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the missing puzzle piece is either in the box or blending in on the floor. However, the second statement tells us that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor. This means that the missing puzzle piece must be in the box, as it cannot be blending in on the floor.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
