The milk isn't chilling in the fridge.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that if the milk is not chilling in the fridge, then it must be on the counter. This is because the first statement tells us that the milk must be in one of the two places mentioned, and the second statement rules out one of those places (the fridge). Therefore, the only remaining option is that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
