The watch isn't on his wrist.\n\nGiven these statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If the watch is not on his wrist, then it must be true that the watch is either charging on the dresser or in some other location.\n- Since the first statement states that the watch is either charging on the dresser or on his wrist, and the second statement rules out the watch being on his wrist, the only remaining possibility is that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
