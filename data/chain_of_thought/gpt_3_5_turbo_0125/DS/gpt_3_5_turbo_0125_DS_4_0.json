Therefore, the only remaining option from the first statement is that the cat is napping on the couch. This is because the first statement states that the cat is either napping on the couch or playing in the bedroom, and we have eliminated the possibility of the cat playing in the bedroom.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The cat is napping on the couch.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
