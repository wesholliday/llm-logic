The statement \"Either the smip is shripped or it is lupped\" can be represented as: S v L\n2. The statement \"The smip is not lupped\" can be represented as: ~L\n\nNow, if we combine these two statements:\n- S v L\n- ~L\n\nWe can infer that the smip is shripped (S) because if it is not lupped (~L) and the statement is either S or L, then it must be S.\n\nTherefore, the inference that can be made is: \"The smip is shripped.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
