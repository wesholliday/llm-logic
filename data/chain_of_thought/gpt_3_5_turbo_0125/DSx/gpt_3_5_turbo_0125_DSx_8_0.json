The first statement is \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it is daggled.\"\n2. The second statement is \"The sprocket is not daggled.\"\n\nGiven these two statements, we can reason as follows:\n- If the first statement is true and the sprocket is not daggled (as stated in the second statement), then the sprocket must be cranked because the first statement says that either the sprocket is cranked or it is daggled, and we know it is not daggled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The sprocket is cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
