From the statement \"Either the smonk is vreebled or it is plagged,\" we know that at least one of the two conditions is true. This can be represented as: V or P.\n\n2. From the statement \"The smonk is not plagged,\" we can infer the negation of plagged, which means the smonk is not plagged. This can be represented as: ~P.\n\n3. From the above information, when combined, we have the premises V or P and ~P. With this information, we can conclude that the smonk is vreebled because if it is not plagged, the only remaining possibility is for it to be vreebled.\n\nNow, considering the steps taken, we can address the initial question.
