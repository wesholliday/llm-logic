The statement \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it is plopped\" can be represented as: Grommet is sploffed OR Grommet is plopped.\n2. The statement \"The grommet is not plopped\" can be represented as: Not Grommet is plopped.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the grommet is either sploffed or plopped. From the second statement, we know that the grommet is not plopped. Therefore, if the grommet is not plopped, it must be sploffed because it cannot be both plopped and sploffed at the same time.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The grommet is sploffed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
