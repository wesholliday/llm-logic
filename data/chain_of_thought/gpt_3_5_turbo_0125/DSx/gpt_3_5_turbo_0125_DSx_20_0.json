The first statement is \"Either the fleeg is bluttered or it is surned.\" This statement tells us that one of the two options must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The fleeg is not surned.\" This statement rules out the possibility of the fleeg being surned.\n\nCombining the two statements, we know that the fleeg cannot be surned. Since the first statement tells us that one of the options must be true and the second statement rules out the possibility of the fleeg being surned, the only remaining option is that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The fleeg is bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
