The first statement is: \"Either the glip is slogged or it is tragged.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"The glip is not tragged.\"\n\nGiven these two statements, we can analyze them together:\n\n- If the glip is not tragged, then according to the first statement, it must be slogged. This is because the first statement states that the glip is either slogged or tragged, and since it is not tragged, it must be slogged.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that 'The glip is slogged'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
