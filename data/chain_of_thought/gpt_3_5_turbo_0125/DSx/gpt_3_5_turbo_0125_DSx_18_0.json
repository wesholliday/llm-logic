The first statement is: \"Either the shank is plooked or it is nugged.\" This statement indicates that one of the two conditions must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The shank is not nugged.\" This statement tells us that the shank is not in the condition of being nugged.\n\nCombining the two statements:\n- We know that the shank is not nugged.\n- From the first statement, we know that the shank must be either plooked or nugged.\n\nGiven that the shank is not nugged and it must be either plooked or nugged, we can infer that \"The shank is plooked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
