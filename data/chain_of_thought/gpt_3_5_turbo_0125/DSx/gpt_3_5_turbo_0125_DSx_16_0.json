The first statement is \"Either the sneg is crampled or it is sproted.\" This statement indicates that at least one of the two conditions is true. So, it could be the case that the sneg is crampled, or it could be sproted, or both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The sneg is not sproted.\" This statement tells us that the sneg is definitely not sproted.\n\nCombining the two statements:\n- We know that the sneg is not sproted.\n- From the first statement, we know that the sneg is either crampled or sproted.\n\nSince we know the sneg is not sproted, the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that the sneg is crampled. Therefore, we can infer that \"The sneg is crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
