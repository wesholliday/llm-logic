The first statement is \"Either the flugel is blimmed or it is zargled.\" This can be represented as: (F \u2192 B) \u2228 (F \u2192 Z)\n2. The second statement is \"The flugel is not zargled.\" This can be represented as: \u00acZ\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\n- From the first statement, we know that if the flugel is not blimmed, then it must be zargled. This can be represented as: \u00acB \u2192 Z\n- From the second statement, we know that the flugel is not zargled. This is represented as: \u00acZ\n\nCombining the above two conclusions, we can infer that if the flugel is not blimmed, then it must be zargled. Since we know that the flugel is not zargled, we can conclude that the flugel must be blimmed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The flugel is blimmed\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
