And from the second statement, we know that the sprocket is not daggled. \n\nIf we put these two together, we have:\n\\(C \\lor D\\) (either the sprocket is cranked or it is daggled)\n\\(\\neg D\\) (the sprocket is not daggled)\n\nFrom these two statements, we can deduce that the sprocket must be cranked.
