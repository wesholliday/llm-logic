The first statement is: \"Either the zinger is fraggled or it is smoogled.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"The zinger is not smoogled.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the zinger is either fraggled or smoogled. Since the second statement tells us that the zinger is not smoogled, it must be fraggled based on the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The zinger is fraggled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
