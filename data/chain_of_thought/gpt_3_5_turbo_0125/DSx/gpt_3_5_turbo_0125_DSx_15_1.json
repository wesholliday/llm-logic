            "content": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"Either the dreb is vroombed or it is spened.\"\n2. This can be written as: D \u2228 S (where D represents \"the dreb is vroombed\" and S represents \"it is spened\").\n3. We are also given the statement \"The dreb is not spened,\" which can be written as: \u00acS. \n\nNow, we want to know if from D \u2228 S and \u00acS, we can infer D. \n\nIf we have D \u2228 S and \u00acS, it would mean that \"D \u2228 S\" is true and \"\u00acS\" is true. \n\nFrom the statement \"D \u2228 S,\" we know that at least one of them is true - either D is true or S is true. \nBut since we also know that \"\u00acS\" is true, it means that S (it is spened) is false. So, the only possibility left is D (the dreb is vroombed) being true, since S is false.\n\nTo summarize, if we have D \u2228 S (either the dreb is vroombed or it is spened) and \u00acS (the dreb is not spened), we can infer that D (the dreb is vroombed).\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'yes'.
