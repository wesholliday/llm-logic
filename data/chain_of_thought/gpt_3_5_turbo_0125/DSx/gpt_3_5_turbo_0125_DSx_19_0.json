The first statement is: \"Either the smonk is vreebled or it is plagged.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"The smonk is not plagged.\"\n\nGiven these two statements, we know that the smonk is not plagged. However, the first statement does not provide any information about whether the smonk is vreebled or not. It only states that the smonk is either vreebled or plagged, but it does not exclude the possibility that the smonk is not vreebled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The smonk is vreebled\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
