The statement \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it is crinked\" can be represented as: (Fribble is snurgled) OR (Fribble is crinked).\n\n2. The statement \"The fribble is not crinked\" can be represented as: NOT (Fribble is crinked).\n\n3. Combining the two statements, we have:\n(Fribble is snurgled) OR (Fribble is crinked)\nNOT (Fribble is crinked)\n\n4. From the second statement, we know that the fribble is not crinked. Therefore, we can conclude that the fribble must be snurgled, as the only remaining option is that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nBased on the logical reasoning above, the inference that \"The fribble is snurgled\" can be made from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
