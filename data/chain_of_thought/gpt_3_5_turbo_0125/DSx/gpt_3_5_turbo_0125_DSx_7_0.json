The first statement is: \"Either the whiffle is shanked or it is tinked.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"The whiffle is not tinked.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if the whiffle is not tinked, then it must be shanked. This is because the first statement states that the whiffle must be either shanked or tinked.\n\nGiven that the second statement confirms that the whiffle is not tinked, we can conclude that the whiffle must be shanked based on the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The whiffle is shanked'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
