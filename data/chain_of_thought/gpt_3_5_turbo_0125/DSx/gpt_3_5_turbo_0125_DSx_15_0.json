The first statement is: \"Either the dreb is vroombed or it is spened.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"The dreb is not spened.\"\n\nGiven these two statements, we know that the dreb is not spened. From the first statement, we can infer that if the dreb is not spened, then it must be vroombed because the first statement states that the dreb is either vroombed or spened.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The dreb is vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
