The first statement is: \"Either the wug is sproinged or it is garpled.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"The wug is not garpled.\"\n\nGiven these two statements, we can analyze them together:\n\n- If the wug is not garpled, then it must be sproinged or something else.\n- Since the first statement says that the wug is either sproinged or garpled, and we know it is not garpled, then it must be sproinged.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The wug is sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
