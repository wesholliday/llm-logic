The first statement is: \"Either the twonk is plinked or it is varnished.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"The twonk is not plinked.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the twonk is either plinked or varnished. Since we know from the second statement that the twonk is not plinked, it must be varnished based on the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The twonk is varnished.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
