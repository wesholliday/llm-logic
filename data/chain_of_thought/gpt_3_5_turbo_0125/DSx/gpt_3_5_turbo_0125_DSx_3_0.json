The first statement is \"Either the splat is morphed or it is quanked.\" This statement indicates that one of the two conditions must be true: either the splat is morphed or it is quanked.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The splat is not quanked.\" This statement tells us that the splat is not in the quanked condition.\n\nCombining the two statements:\n- We know that the splat is not quanked.\n- Since the first statement tells us that the splat must be either morphed or quanked, and we know it is not quanked, then the only remaining possibility is that the splat is morphed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The splat is morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
