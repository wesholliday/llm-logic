The first statement is a disjunction (OR) between two possibilities: \"Either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\"\n2. The second statement negates one of the possibilities from the first statement: \"The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor.\"\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that if the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor, then it must be in the box because the first statement states that the missing puzzle piece must be in one of these two locations.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
