The statement \"Either the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet or it is in the car\" implies that the umbrella is in one of these two locations.\n2. The statement \"The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet\" rules out the possibility of the umbrella being in the closet.\n3. Since the umbrella must be in either the closet or the car, and it is not in the closet, it logically follows that the umbrella must be in the car.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The umbrella is in the car.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
