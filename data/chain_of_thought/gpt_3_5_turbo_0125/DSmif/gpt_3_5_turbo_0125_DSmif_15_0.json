This means that if the shoes are not lined up by the door, they must be in the closet.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the shoes might not be lined up by the door, which aligns with the first statement's condition that if they are not by the door, they are in the closet.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
