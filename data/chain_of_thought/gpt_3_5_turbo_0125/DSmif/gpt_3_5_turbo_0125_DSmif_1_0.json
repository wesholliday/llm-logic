This means that Fido is not outside of these two locations.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that if Fido is not in the garden, then Fido must be inside. This is because the first statement tells us that Fido is either in the garden or inside, and the second statement rules out the possibility of Fido being in the garden.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
