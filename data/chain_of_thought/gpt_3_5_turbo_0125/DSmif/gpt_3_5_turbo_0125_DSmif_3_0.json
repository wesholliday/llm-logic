The statement given is a disjunction (OR statement): \"Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer.\"\n2. We are also given the negation of the first part of the disjunction: \"The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer because if the keys are not dangling in the cabinet (as stated in the second statement), then they must be in the drawer based on the original disjunction.\n\nTherefore, the inference \"The keys are in the drawer\" can be made from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
