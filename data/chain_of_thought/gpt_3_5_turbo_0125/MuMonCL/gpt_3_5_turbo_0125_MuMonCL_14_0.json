This means that the contract was valid for at least a year and had the option to be renewed. However, it does not necessarily mean that the contract was only valid for a year. It could have been valid for longer than a year. Therefore, we cannot infer that the contract must have been valid for exactly a year from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
