This means that completing the application online is a requirement, but it does not necessarily mean that completing it online is the only requirement. It is possible that there are other requirements for the application as well. Therefore, we can infer that completing the application online is necessary, but we cannot definitively infer that it is the only requirement.\n\nAnswer: no",
