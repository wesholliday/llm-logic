However, the presence of fresh towels does not necessarily mean that the room was cleaned daily. It is possible for fresh towels to be provided without the room being cleaned daily. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the room must have been cleaned daily based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
