            "content": "Explanation: The original statement specifies two separate requirements: the application must have been completed online and it must have included references. Combining these two requirements into one statement changes the meaning, as it suggests that the references must have been included during the online completion of the application. However, the original statement does not specify when the references were included, only that they must have been included at some point. Therefore, we cannot infer that the references were included during the online completion of the application.\n\nAnswer: no",
