These conditions are connected by the word \"and,\" indicating that both conditions must be true. Therefore, we cannot combine the two conditions into one and remove the repetition of \"have been.\" The original statement explicitly states that the package must have been delivered today and separately that it must have been signed for.\n\nAnswer: no",
