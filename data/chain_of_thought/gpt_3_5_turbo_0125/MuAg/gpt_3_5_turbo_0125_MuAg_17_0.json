These conditions are connected by the word \"and,\" indicating that both conditions must be met. However, the original statement does not explicitly state that the accuracy of the report is dependent on the submission time. Therefore, we cannot infer that the accuracy of the report is contingent on the submission time.\n\nAnswer: no",
