When we combine these two pieces of information, we can infer that the flight must have been delayed and rerouted. This is because if the flight was delayed and then rerouted, it implies that both events occurred. Therefore, we can confidently infer that the flight must have been delayed and rerouted.\n\nAnswer: yes",
