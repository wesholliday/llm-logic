            "content": "Explanation: In the original statement, it is explicitly mentioned that the project must have been completed by Friday and it must have been under budget. This means both conditions need to be met for the project to be considered successful. If we remove the repetition of \"must have been\" in the second part of the statement, it changes the meaning. The original statement emphasizes that both conditions are necessary, while the modified statement could be interpreted as the project only needing to be completed by Friday without the requirement of being under budget. Therefore, we cannot infer the modified statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: no",
