This means that the fribble could be crinked or not crinked.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the fribble must be either crinked or snurgled. This means that if the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that 'The fribble is snurgled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
