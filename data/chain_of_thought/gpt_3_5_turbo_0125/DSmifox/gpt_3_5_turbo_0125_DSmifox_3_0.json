So, it tells us that either the splat is quanked or it is morphed.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can see that:\n- It is possible that the splat is not quanked.\n- If the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed according to the second statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The splat is morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
