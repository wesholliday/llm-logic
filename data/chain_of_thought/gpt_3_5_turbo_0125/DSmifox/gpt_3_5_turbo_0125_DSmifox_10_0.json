If we combine these two pieces of information, we can conclude that if the wug is not garpled, then it must be sproinged. This is because the second statement states that the wug must be either garpled or sproinged, and since it might not be garpled, it must be sproinged.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The wug is sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
