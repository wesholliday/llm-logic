It states that either the zinger is smoogled or it is fraggled.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If the zinger is not smoogled (from the first statement), then according to the second statement, it must be fraggled.\n- If the zinger is smoogled (from the second statement), then it cannot be fraggled.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that 'The zinger is fraggled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
