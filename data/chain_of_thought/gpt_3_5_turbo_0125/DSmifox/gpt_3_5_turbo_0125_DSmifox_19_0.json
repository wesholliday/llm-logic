It only suggests a possibility that the smonk is not plagged.\n\n2. \"Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled\" - This statement tells us that the smonk must be either plagged or vreebled, meaning it cannot be neither plagged nor vreebled.\n\nCombining the two statements:\n\n- If the smonk is not plagged (from the first statement), then it must be vreebled (from the second statement).\n- If the smonk is plagged (from the second statement), we cannot infer whether it is vreebled or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that 'The smonk is vreebled' only if the smonk is not plagged. \n\nAnswer: yes",
