It states that if the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer the following:\n- If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer that 'It was varnished' without knowing for certain that the twonk was indeed plinked. The original statements do not provide direct information about whether the twonk was actually plinked. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer 'It was varnished' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
