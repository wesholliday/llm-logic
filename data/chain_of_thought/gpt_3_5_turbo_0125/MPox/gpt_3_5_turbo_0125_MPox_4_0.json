The first statement is 'The fribble was snurgled'.\n2. The second statement is 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked'.\n\nGiven these statements, we can use the concept of logical implication. If the first statement is true ('The fribble was snurgled'), and the second statement is also true ('If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked'), then we can infer that the conclusion of the implication is true ('The fribble crinked'). This is because in a valid implication, if the antecedent (the first part) is true, then the consequent (the second part) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and the logical implication, we can infer that 'The fribble crinked'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
