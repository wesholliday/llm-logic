Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, then we can infer that B is true.\n\nGiven:\n1. The flug was blummed\n2. If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed\n\nUsing modus ponens:\n- Since the flug was blummed (from statement 1), we can apply the conditional statement from statement 2.\n- If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\n- Therefore, we can infer that the flug was zimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
