It states that if the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can see that the second statement is a conditional statement where the condition is \"The sneg was crampled.\" If the condition is met, then the consequent is \"The sneg sproted the frink.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The sneg sproted the frink.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
