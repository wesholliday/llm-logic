This is based on the logical structure of a conditional statement: if the antecedent (the zinger was fraggled) is true, then the consequent (the zinger was smoogled) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that \"The zinger was smoogled\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
