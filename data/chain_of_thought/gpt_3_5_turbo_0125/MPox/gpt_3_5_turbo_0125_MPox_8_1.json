The sprocket was cranked.\n2. If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n\nTo infer \"The sprocket was daggled\" from the given premises, we can use Modus Ponens, a valid form of deductive reasoning, which states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we also have A, we can infer B.\n\nIn this case, premise 1 tells us that \"The sprocket was cranked\", which corresponds to A in the conditional statement. Now, using Modus Ponens, since A is true, and the conditional statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" is also given, we can infer B, which corresponds to \"The sprocket was daggled\".\n\nTherefore, based on logical reasoning and the principles of Modus Ponens, we can indeed infer that \"The sprocket was daggled\" from the given premises. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
