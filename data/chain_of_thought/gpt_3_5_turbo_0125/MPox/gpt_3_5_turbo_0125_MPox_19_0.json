It states that if the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer the following:\n\n- If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\n- We know that the smonk was vreebled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The smonk plagged.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
