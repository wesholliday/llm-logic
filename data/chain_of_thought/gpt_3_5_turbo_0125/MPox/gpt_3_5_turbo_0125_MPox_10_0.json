Then, we have the statement \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\" This is a conditional statement where the antecedent is \"the wug was sproinged\" and the consequent is \"it was garpled.\" Since the wug was indeed sproinged, we can conclude that it was garpled based on the given conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"It was garpled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
