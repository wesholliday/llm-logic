It states that if the sprocket was cranked, then it was daggled.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer the following:\n- If the sprocket was cranked, then it was daggled.\n- We know the sprocket was cranked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The sprocket was daggled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
