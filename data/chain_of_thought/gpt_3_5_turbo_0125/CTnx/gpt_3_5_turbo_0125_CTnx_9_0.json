The original statement is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If A then B.\" The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A.\"\n\nIn this case, the original statement is \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was not varnished.\" The contrapositive of this statement would be \"If the twonk was varnished, then it was not plinked.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
