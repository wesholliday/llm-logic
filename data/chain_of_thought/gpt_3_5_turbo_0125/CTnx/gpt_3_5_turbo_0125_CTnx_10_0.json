            "content": "To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. The original statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B\", where A is \"the wug was sproinged\" and B is \"the wug was not garpled\". \n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\". \n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of the original statement \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was not garpled\" is \"If the wug was garpled, then it was not sproinged\". \n\nSo, yes, we can infer \"If the wug was garpled, then the wug was not sproinged\" from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: yes",
