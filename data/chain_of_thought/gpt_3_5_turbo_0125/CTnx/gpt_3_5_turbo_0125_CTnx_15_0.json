The original statement is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If A then B.\" \n\nIn the original statement, we have:\nA: the dreb was vroombed\nB: the dreb was not spened\n\nSo, the original statement can be represented as: If A, then B.\n\nTo infer the second statement, we need to switch the positions of A and B in the original statement. This would give us: If B, then A.\n\nTherefore, the second statement would be: If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
