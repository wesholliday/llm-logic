The contrapositive of \"If A, then not B\" is \"If B, then not A.\"\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of the original statement is: \"If the smonk did plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled.\"\n\nSo, yes, we can infer the statement \"If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled\" from the given statement.",
