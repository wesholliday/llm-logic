The original statement \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was not tragged\" can be represented as: \n\nIf A (glip was slogged), then not B (glip was not tragged).\n\nTo infer the second statement \"If the glip was tragged, then the glip was not slogged\", we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement switches the hypothesis and conclusion and negates both. \n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement is: If B (glip was tragged), then not A (glip was not slogged).\n\nTherefore, based on the contrapositive of the original statement, we can infer that if the glip was tragged, then the glip was not slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
