            "content": "To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A then B,\" where A is \"the zinger was fraggled\" and B is \"the zinger was not smoogled.\" \n\nIn a conditional statement, the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A.\" \n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of the first statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled\" is \"If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
