The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of the original statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat did not quank\" is \"If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer the statement \"If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed\" from the given statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat did not quank.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
