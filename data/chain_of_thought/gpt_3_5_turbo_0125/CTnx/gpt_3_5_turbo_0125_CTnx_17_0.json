The original statement is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If A then B.\" The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A.\"\n\nIn this case, the original statement is \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob did not movated.\" The contrapositive of this statement would be \"If the flob movated, then the flob was not skizzled.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
