The first statement is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If A then B\" (If the wug was flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint). \n\nTo infer the second statement \"If the wug bimmed the zoint, then the wug was not flooped\" from the first statement, we need to identify if the contrapositive of the first statement is equivalent to the second statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A\".\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of the first statement \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint\" is \"If the wug bimmed the zoint, then the wug was not flooped\". \n\nTherefore, we can infer the second statement from the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
