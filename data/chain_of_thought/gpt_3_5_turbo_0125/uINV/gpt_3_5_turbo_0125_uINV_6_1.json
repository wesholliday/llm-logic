In this case, Bob could still have chosen pasta, or he may have chosen another option. There is no direct connection between Sue not choosing pizza and Bob not choosing pasta, as the original statement only provides information about what happens when Sue chooses pizza.\n\nSo, we cannot definitively infer that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta based solely on the original conditional statement.",
