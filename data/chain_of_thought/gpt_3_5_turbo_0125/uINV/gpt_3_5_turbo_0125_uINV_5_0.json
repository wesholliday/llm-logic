However, the contrapositive does not necessarily imply the reverse statement that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis. This is because there could be other reasons why Amy played tennis besides Jeff playing basketball.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\n\nAnswer: no",
