If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n2. Contrapositive of the above statement: If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nNow, let's consider the contrapositive statement:\n\n\"If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\"\n\nFrom this contrapositive statement, we can see that the robot's visit to Jupiter is dependent on the alien's visit to Mars. Therefore, if the alien did not visit Mars, it implies that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
