This statement implies that whenever Mary is present at the wedding, Sue is also present. This does not exclude the possibility that Sue can be present at the wedding even if Mary is not.\n\n2. If the contrapositive of the first statement holds true, it would suggest that if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding. This is because in a contrapositive statement, the terms are switched and negated.\n\nNow, considering the given statements and the logical implications presented above, let's think about the original question.\n\nIf Mary was not at the wedding, can we confidently say that Sue was not at the wedding based on the information provided in the initial statement? or do we have enough information to draw the conclusion that Sue was also not at the wedding if Mary wasn't there?\n\nAnswer: No",
