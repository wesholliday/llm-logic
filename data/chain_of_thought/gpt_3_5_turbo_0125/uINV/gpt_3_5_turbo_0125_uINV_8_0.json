The original statement is: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This is a conditional statement in the form \"if p, then q.\"\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"if p, then q\" is \"if not q, then not p.\" Therefore, if we take the contrapositive of the original statement, we get: \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\"\n\nSo, based on the contrapositive of the original statement, if the vampire was not awake, then we can infer that the mummy was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
