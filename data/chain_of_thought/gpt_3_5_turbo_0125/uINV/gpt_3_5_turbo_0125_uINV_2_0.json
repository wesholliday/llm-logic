If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n2. Contrapositive of the statement: If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nGiven the contrapositive statement, we can infer that if the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest. However, the original statement does not provide direct information about the unicorn's location when the griffin is not in the forest.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that if the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no",
