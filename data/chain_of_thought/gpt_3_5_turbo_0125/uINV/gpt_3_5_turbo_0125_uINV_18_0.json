Therefore, if the doll was not plastic, we cannot definitively say that the truck was not metal because the original statement does not provide information about what happens when the doll is not plastic.\n\nSo, based on the original statement alone, we cannot infer that if the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\n\nAnswer: no",
