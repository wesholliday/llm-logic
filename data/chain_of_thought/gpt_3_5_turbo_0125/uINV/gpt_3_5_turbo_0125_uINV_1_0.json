If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n2. Contrapositive of the statement in 1: If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nGiven the contrapositive statement, we can infer that if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding. However, the original question asks about the reverse scenario: if Mary was not at the wedding, can we infer that Sue was not at the wedding?\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the possibility that Sue could have been at the wedding even if Mary was not there. The original statement does not provide any information about Sue's presence at the wedding independently of Mary's presence.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
