(C -> M)\n\nTo determine whether we can infer the inverse of this statement:\n\n2. If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry. (~C -> ~M)\n\nLet's analyze this logically:\n\nFrom the original statement (C -> M):\nIf the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. This implies that whenever the cake is chocolate, the muffins will be blueberry. However, when the cake is not chocolate, we cannot definitively conclude anything about the flavor of the muffins based solely on the original statement. It is possible that the muffins could still be blueberry even if the cake is not chocolate, as the original statement does not dictate the flavor of the muffins when the cake is not chocolate.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nAnswer: no",
