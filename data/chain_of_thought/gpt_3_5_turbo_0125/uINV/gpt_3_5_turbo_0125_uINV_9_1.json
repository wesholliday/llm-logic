If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt: Let's represent this statement as \"L -> M\" (L = Lisa bought the red shirt, M = Mark bought the blue shirt).\n\n2. If Lisa did not buy the red shirt: This would be the negation of the first statement which is \"~L\" (Lisa did not buy the red shirt).\n\n3. From (2), can we infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt: This would be the negation of M, which is \"~M\" (Mark did not buy the blue shirt).\n\nNow, we need to determine if \"~L -> ~M\" is a valid inference.\n\nTo test this, let's use the contrapositive of the original statement (L -> M), which is \"~M -> ~L\" (If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt). This contrapositive statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nSince the contrapositive of the original statement is true, then its inference (~L -> ~M) is also true. Thus, if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
