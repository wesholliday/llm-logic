This means that the first part of the conditional statement in statement 1 is false (the alien did not visit Mars). In a conditional statement, if the hypothesis is false, the entire statement is considered true regardless of the truth value of the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, since the alien did not visit Mars, the conditional statement \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" is considered true. This means that we cannot infer that the robot did not visit Jupiter based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
