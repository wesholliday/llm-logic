The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\"\n2. The second statement is a negation of the antecedent of the conditional statement: \"Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n\nGiven these statements, we can make the following deductions:\n- If Ben did not eat pasta, we cannot conclude anything about Kate eating the salad based on the conditional statement alone. The conditional statement only tells us about Kate eating the salad when Ben eats pasta, but it does not provide information about what happens when Ben does not eat pasta.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Kate did not eat the salad based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
