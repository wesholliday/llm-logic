However, since we know from the second statement that the bear was not in the cave, we cannot definitively conclude the location of the wolf based on the given information. The wolf could still be in the den or not in the den, as the first statement does not provide any information about the wolf's location when the bear is not in the cave.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the wolf was not in the den based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
