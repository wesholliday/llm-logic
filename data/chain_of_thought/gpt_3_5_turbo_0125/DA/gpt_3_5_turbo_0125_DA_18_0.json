            "content": "To determine if we can infer that the truck was not metal from the given statements, we need to analyze the logic involved. \n\n1. \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" - This is a conditional statement. It means that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the doll is not plastic.\n\n2. \"The doll was not plastic\" - This statement tells us that the doll was not plastic. \n\nFrom the given information, we can conclude that since the doll was not plastic, we do not have any information about the material of the truck. The first statement only tells us about the relationship between the doll being plastic and the truck being metal. Since we know the doll was not plastic, we cannot make any definitive inference about the material of the truck.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the truck was not metal from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
