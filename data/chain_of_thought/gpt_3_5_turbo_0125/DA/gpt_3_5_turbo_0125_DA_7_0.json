The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\"\n2. The second statement is the negation of the antecedent of the conditional statement: \"Alex did not finish the race.\"\n\nGiven these statements, we can infer that if the condition in the first statement is not met (Alex did not finish the race), we cannot make a definite conclusion about the consequent (Chris finishing the race) because the conditional statement does not provide information about what happens when the condition is not met. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Chris did not finish the race based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
