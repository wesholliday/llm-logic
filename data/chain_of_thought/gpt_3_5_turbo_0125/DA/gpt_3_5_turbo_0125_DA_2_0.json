The contrapositive of \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A.\" \n\nGiven:\n1. If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. (A -> B)\n2. The griffin was not in the forest. (not A)\n\nFrom the contrapositive, we have:\n3. If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest. (not B -> not A)\n\nSince we know the griffin was not in the forest (not A), we can conclude that the unicorn was not necessarily in the forest, as the contrapositive does not provide information about the unicorn's location.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the unicorn was not in the forest based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
