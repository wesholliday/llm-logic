It means that whenever the apple is red, the banana is yellow. It does not provide any information when the apple is not red.\n\n2. \"The apple was not red\" - This statement tells us that the apple was not red.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that the apple was not red. However, we do not have any information about what color the apple actually was. Since the first statement only tells us about the relationship between the colors of the apple and the banana when the apple is red, and we know the apple was not red, we cannot definitively infer the color of the banana.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The banana was not yellow' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
