However, this does not provide direct information about whether Mark bought the blue shirt or not. The absence of information about Lisa's purchase does not necessarily mean that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
