The first statement is: 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue.'\n2. The second statement is: 'The car was not red.'\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. Since the car was not red according to the second statement, we cannot conclude anything about the color of the truck based on these two statements alone.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The truck was not blue' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
