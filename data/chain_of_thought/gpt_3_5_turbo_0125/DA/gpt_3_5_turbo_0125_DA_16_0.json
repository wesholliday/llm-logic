It means that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the shirt is not cotton.\n\n2. \"The shirt was not cotton\": This statement tells us that the shirt was not cotton. Since the first statement only tells us about the relationship between cotton shirts and denim pants, this new information does not directly contradict the first statement.\n\nGiven the information provided, we cannot definitively infer that the pants were not denim based on the fact that the shirt was not cotton. The second statement does not provide enough information to determine the material of the pants.",
