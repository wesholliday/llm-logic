Symbolically: Joe -> Lucy.\n\n2. \"Joe did not go to the park\" - This statement negates the antecedent of the conditional statement. So, we know Joe did not go to the park: \u00acJoe.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that we do not have enough information to determine whether Lucy went to the zoo or not. The absence of Joe going to the park does not definitively tell us anything about Lucy's visit to the zoo. Lucy could have gone to the zoo for a different reason or not gone at all.",
