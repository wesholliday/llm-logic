However, we cannot directly infer that Erin did not take a train based on this information alone. The original statement only provides a conditional relationship between Sam and Erin, but it does not provide any information about Erin's mode of transportation if Sam did not take a plane.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Erin did not take a train based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
