However, the second statement tells us that the cake was not chocolate. Since the cake was not chocolate, we cannot determine the flavor of the muffins based on the first statement alone.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the muffins were not blueberry based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
