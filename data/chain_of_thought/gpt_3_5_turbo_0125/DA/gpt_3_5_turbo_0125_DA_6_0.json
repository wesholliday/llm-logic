It means that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if Sue did not choose pizza.\n\n2. \"Sue did not choose pizza\" - This statement tells us that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that Sue did not choose pizza. However, we cannot directly infer from this information alone whether Bob chose pasta or not. The first statement only tells us what happens if Sue chose pizza, but it does not provide any information about what happens if Sue did not choose pizza. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude whether Bob did or did not choose pasta based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
