This means that at least one of these conditions must be true.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the smip might not be lupped. This means that there is a possibility that the smip is not lupped.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that if the smip is not lupped (as indicated in statement 2), then it must be shripped (as stated in statement 1). This is because if the smip is not lupped, then the only other option left from statement 1 is that it is shripped.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The smip is shripped.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
