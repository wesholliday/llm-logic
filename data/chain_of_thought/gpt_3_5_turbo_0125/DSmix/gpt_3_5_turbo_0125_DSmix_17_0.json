From the second statement, we know that there is a possibility that the flob is not movated.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude that the flob is skizzled. It is possible that the flob is not skizzled and is instead movated, as long as it is not both skizzled and movated simultaneously.\n\nAnswer: no",
