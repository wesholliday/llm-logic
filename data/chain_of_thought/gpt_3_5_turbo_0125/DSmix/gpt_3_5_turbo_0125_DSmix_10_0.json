From the second statement, we know that it is possible that the wug is not garpled.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively infer that the wug is sproinged. This is because the first statement only tells us that if the wug is not sproinged, then it must be garpled. It does not provide any information about the wug being sproinged.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the wug is sproinged based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
