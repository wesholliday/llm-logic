So, if the sneg is not sproted, then it must be crampled.\n\n2. \"The sneg might not be sproted\" - This statement confirms that the sneg is not necessarily sproted.\n\nCombining the two statements, we can conclude that if the sneg is not sproted, then it must be crampled. Therefore, we can infer \"The sneg is crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
