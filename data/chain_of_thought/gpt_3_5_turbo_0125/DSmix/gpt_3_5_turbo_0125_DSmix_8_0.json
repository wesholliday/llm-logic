So, if the sprocket is not cranked, then it must be daggled.\n\n2. \"The sprocket might not be daggled\" - This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the sprocket is not daggled.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer the following:\n- If the sprocket is not daggled (as suggested by the second statement), then it must be cranked (as per the first statement).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The sprocket is cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
