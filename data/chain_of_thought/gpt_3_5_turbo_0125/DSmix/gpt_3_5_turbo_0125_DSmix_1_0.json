So, it can be written as: (Flugel is blimmed) OR (Flugel is zargled).\n\n2. \"The flugel might not be zargled\" - This statement suggests that it is possible that the flugel is not zargled. This can be written as: NOT (Flugel is zargled).\n\nCombining the two statements:\n- From the first statement, we know that the flugel is either blimmed or zargled.\n- From the second statement, we know that the flugel might not be zargled.\n\nTherefore, if the flugel is not zargled, it must be blimmed based on the first statement. So, we can infer that \"The flugel is blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
