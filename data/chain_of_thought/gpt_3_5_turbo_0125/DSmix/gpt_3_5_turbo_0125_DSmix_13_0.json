So, if the glip is not tragged, then it must be slogged.\n\n2. \"The glip might not be tragged\": This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the glip is not tragged.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that if the glip is not tragged, then it must be slogged. Therefore, we can infer that 'The glip is slogged' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
