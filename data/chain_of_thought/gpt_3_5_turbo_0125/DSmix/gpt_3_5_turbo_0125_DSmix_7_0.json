Therefore, the contrapositive of the first statement is: \u00acT \u2192 S.\n\nGiven the second statement that the whiffle might not be tinked (\u00acT), we can infer from the contrapositive of the first statement that the whiffle is shanked (S).\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The whiffle is shanked' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
