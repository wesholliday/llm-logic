The first statement is: \"Either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned.\" This can be represented as: F or S.\n2. The second statement is: \"The fleeg might not be surned.\" This can be represented as: ~S.\n\nFrom these statements, we can deduce the following:\n- If F or S is true, and ~S is true, then F must be true. This is because if S is false, then the only possibility left is F being true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that 'The fleeg is bluttered'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
