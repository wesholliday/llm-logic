From the second statement, we know that the smonk might not be plagged, which means it could be vreebled. However, we cannot definitively conclude that the smonk is vreebled because it could still be plagged based on the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that 'The smonk is vreebled' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
