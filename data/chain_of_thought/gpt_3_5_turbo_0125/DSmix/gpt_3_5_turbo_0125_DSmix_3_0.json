So, it could be the case that the splat is morphed or it could be quanked.\n\n2. \"The splat might not be quanked\" - This statement tells us that there is a possibility that the splat is not quanked.\n\nCombining these two statements, we know that the splat is either morphed or quanked, and there is a possibility that it is not quanked. However, we cannot definitively conclude that the splat is morphed because it could still be quanked based on the information provided.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The splat is morphed\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
