In this case, the statement \"The froodle must be crunk plonk flonk and blurble a flimble\" implies that the froodle must have all those characteristics, but it does not necessarily mean that the froodle must have only the characteristics \"crunk plonk flonk\". Therefore, we cannot infer \"The froodle must be crunk plonk flonk\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
