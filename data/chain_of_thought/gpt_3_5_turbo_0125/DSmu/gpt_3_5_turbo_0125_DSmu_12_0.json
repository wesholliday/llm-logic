The second statement tells us that it's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet. This means that the jacket cannot be hanging in the closet.\n\nTherefore, if the jacket cannot be hanging in the closet, and it must be either draped over the chair or hanging in the closet, then the only option left is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nSo, yes, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
