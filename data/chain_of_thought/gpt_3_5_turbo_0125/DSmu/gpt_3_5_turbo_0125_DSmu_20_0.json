It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the sunglasses must be either in her bag or on her head. From statement 2, we know that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be on her head. \n\nTherefore, if the sunglasses must be either in her bag or on her head, and it's not the case that they must be on her head, then the only remaining option is that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nNow, based on the given statements, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
