The first statement is: 'Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.'\n2. The second statement is: 'It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.'\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that if it's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf, then the toy must be in the toy box. This is because the first statement states that the toy is either in the toy box or on the bookshelf, and the second statement rules out the possibility of the toy being on the bookshelf.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The toy is in the toy box' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
