The first statement is: \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\"\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that if it's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack, then the scarf must be stuffed in the backpack. This is because the first statement states that the scarf must be in one of the two places mentioned, and the second statement rules out one of the options.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
