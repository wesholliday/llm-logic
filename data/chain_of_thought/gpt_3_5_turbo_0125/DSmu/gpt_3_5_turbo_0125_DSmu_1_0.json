So, it could be the case that Fido is inside, or it could be the case that Fido must be in the garden, or both.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\": This statement tells us that the condition \"Fido must be in the garden\" is not true.\n\nCombining these two statements, we know that Fido is not required to be in the garden. This leaves us with the possibility that Fido is inside. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
