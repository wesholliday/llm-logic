The first statement is: \"Either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door.\"\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that if it's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door, then the shoes must be in the closet. This is because the first statement states that the shoes are either in the closet or lined up by the door, and the second statement rules out the possibility of the shoes being lined up by the door.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The shoes are in the closet' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
