The second statement tells us that it's not necessary for the missing sock to be under the bed.\n\nTherefore, if it's not necessary for the missing sock to be under the bed, and it must be in either the laundry basket or under the bed, then the missing sock must be in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
