The first statement is: \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that if it's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet, then the keys must be in the drawer. This is because the first statement states that the keys are either in the drawer or dangling in the cabinet, and the second statement rules out the possibility of the keys dangling in the cabinet.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The keys are in the drawer' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
