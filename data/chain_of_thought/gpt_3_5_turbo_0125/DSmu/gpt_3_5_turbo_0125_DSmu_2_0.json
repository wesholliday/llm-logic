The first statement is: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that if it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table, then the book must be on the shelf. This is because the first statement tells us that the book is either on the shelf or on the table, and the second statement rules out the possibility of the book being on the table.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
