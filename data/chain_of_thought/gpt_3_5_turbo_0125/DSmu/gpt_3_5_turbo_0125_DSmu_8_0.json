Statement 1: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\n2. Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer the following:\n- If it's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch, then the first part of statement 1 must be true, which means the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that 'The remote control is on the coffee table.'\n\nAnswer: yes",
