The first statement is: \"Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom.\"\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that if it's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom, then the cat must be napping on the couch. This is because the first statement states that one of the two options must be true, and the second statement rules out the possibility of the cat playing in the bedroom. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
