This means that if the phone is not in the living room, then it must be ringing in the kitchen.\n\nThe second statement tells us that it is not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen. This means that the phone is not necessarily ringing in the kitchen.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that the phone is in the living room because if it is not in the living room, it must be ringing in the kitchen, but the second statement tells us that it is not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes",
