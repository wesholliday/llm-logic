The first statement is: \"Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\"\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that if it's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet, then the umbrella must be in the car. This is because the first statement states that the umbrella is either in the car or in the closet, and the second statement rules out the possibility of it being in the closet.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The umbrella is in the car'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
