The first statement is: 'Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch.'\n2. The second statement is: 'It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch.'\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that if it's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch, then the newspaper must be in the driveway. This is because the first statement tells us that the newspaper is either in the driveway or on the porch, and the second statement rules out the possibility of it being on the porch.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The newspaper is in the driveway' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
