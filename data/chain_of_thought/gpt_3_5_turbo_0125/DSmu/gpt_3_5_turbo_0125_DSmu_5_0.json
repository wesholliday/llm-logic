The first statement is: \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that if it's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry, then the cookies must be in the jar. This is because the first statement states that the cookies are either in the jar or hidden in the pantry, and the second statement rules out the possibility of the cookies being hidden in the pantry.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The cookies are in the jar' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
