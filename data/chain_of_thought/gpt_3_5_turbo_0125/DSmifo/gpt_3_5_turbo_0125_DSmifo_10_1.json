So, if the missing sock is not under the bed, then it must be in the laundry basket according to this statement.\n\nGiven the first statement's possibility that the missing sock may not be under the bed, coupled with the logical disjunction in the second statement, we can indeed infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
