This means the shoes could be somewhere else, such as in the closet.\n\nStatement 2 presents two options: either the shoes are lined up by the door or they are in the closet. Since we know from statement 1 that the shoes might not be lined up by the door, the only remaining option is that they are in the closet.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
