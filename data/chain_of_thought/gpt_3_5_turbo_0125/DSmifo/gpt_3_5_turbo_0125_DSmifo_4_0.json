This means the cat could be doing something else, such as napping on the couch.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the cat is either playing in the bedroom or napping on the couch. Since we already established that the cat might not be playing in the bedroom, the only remaining option is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
