This means it could be somewhere else, such as in the box.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the missing puzzle piece must either be on the floor or in the box. Since we already established that it might not be on the floor, the only remaining option is that it is in the box.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
