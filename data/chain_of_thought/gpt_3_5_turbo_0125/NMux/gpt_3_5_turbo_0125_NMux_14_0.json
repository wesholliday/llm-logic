This does not necessarily mean that the clug was not fleeked; it just means that fleeking the clug is not a requirement.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"The clug might not have been fleeked\" suggests that there is a possibility that the clug was not fleeked. This statement goes beyond the original statement and introduces the idea of uncertainty.\n\nGiven this analysis, we cannot directly infer \"The clug might not have been fleeked\" from \"It's not the case that the clug must have been fleeked\" because the original statement does not definitively state whether the clug was or was not fleeked; it only addresses the necessity of fleeking the clug.",
