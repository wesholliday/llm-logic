This does not necessarily mean that the dreb was not vroombed at all; it just means that it is not a requirement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot directly infer \"The dreb might not have been vroombed\" from the given statement. The absence of necessity does not imply the absence of the action itself.\n\nAnswer: no",
