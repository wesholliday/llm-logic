Therefore, if it is not necessary for the wug to be sproinged, then it is possible that the wug was not sproinged. This aligns with the statement \"The wug might not have been sproinged.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The wug might not have been sproinged\" from \"It's not the case that the wug must have been sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
