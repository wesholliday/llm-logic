In other words, it is possible that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\n2. \"The fleeg might not have been bluttered\" - This statement indicates a possibility that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nGiven the meanings of the two statements, we can see that both express the idea of it being possible that the fleeg was not bluttered.

The fleeg was bluttered.\n2. The fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nThis statement does not confirm whether the fleeg was bluttered or not bluttered, only that the necessity of the fleeg being bluttered is negated.\n\nWhen we say \"The fleeg might not have been bluttered,\" it aligns more with the second scenario mentioned above (the fleeg was not bluttered) but also introduces some uncertainty with the word \"might.\"\n\nGiven the original statement and the consideration of different scenarios, we can say that it is indeed possible to infer \"The fleeg might not have been bluttered\" based on the original statement. This is because the negation of necessity leaves open the possibility that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
