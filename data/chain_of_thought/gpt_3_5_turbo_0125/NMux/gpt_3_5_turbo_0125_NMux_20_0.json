This does not necessarily mean that the fleeg was not bluttered; it just means that bluttering is not a requirement.\n\nOn the other hand, \"The fleeg might not have been bluttered\" suggests a possibility that the fleeg was not bluttered. This statement goes beyond the original statement and introduces uncertainty about whether the fleeg was bluttered or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot directly infer \"The fleeg might not have been bluttered\" from \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered\" because the original statement does not definitively state whether the fleeg was bluttered or not.",
