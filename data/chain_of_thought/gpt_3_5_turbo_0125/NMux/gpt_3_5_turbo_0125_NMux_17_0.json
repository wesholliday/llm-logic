Therefore, if it is not necessary for the flob to have been skizzled, then it is possible that the flob was not skizzled. This aligns with the statement \"The flob might not have been skizzled.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The flob might not have been skizzled\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
