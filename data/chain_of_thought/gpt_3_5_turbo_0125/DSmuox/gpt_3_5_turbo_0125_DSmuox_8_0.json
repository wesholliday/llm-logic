One way to do this is by using the rule of inference called Disjunctive Syllogism. This rule states that if we have a disjunction (A \u2228 B) and the negation of one of the disjuncts (\u00acB), then we can infer the other disjunct (A).\n\nIn this case, we have C \u2228 D and \u00acD. By applying the Disjunctive Syllogism, we can infer C (the sprocket is cranked).\n\nTherefore, the statement \"The sprocket is cranked\" can be logically inferred from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
