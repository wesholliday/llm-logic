Either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled: (wug is sproinged) \u2228 (wug must be garpled)\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that the wug is not required to be garpled: \u00ac(wug must be garpled) = wug is not required to be garpled.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled. Since we have already established that the wug is not required to be garpled, the only possibility left is that the wug is sproinged.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The wug is sproinged'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
