Looking at the second statement, we see that it allows for the flob to be either skizzled or movated. However, the first statement tells us that it's not the case that the flob must be movated.\n\nSince the first statement contradicts the possibility of the flob being movated, and the second statement allows for the flob to be skizzled if it's not movated, we can indeed infer that \"The flob is skizzled.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'yes'.
