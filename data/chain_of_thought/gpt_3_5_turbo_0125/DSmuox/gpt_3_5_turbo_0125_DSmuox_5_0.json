Either the zinger is fraggled or it must be smoogled: (Zinger is fraggled) \u2228 (Zinger must be smoogled).\n\nNow, if we combine the two statements, we have:\n\n\u00ac(Zinger must be smoogled) \u2227 ((Zinger is fraggled) \u2228 (Zinger must be smoogled)).\n\nFrom this, we can see that the zinger not having to be smoogled does not necessarily mean it is fraggled. It could still be smoogled. Therefore, we cannot infer that the zinger is fraggled from the given statements.",
