From the second statement, we know that either the glip is slogged or it must be tragged. Since it's not the case that the glip must be tragged (\u00ac(G \u2192 T)), the only possibility left is that the glip is slogged (S).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The glip is slogged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
