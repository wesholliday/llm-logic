B \u2228 S\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned. Since it's not the case that the fleeg must be surned (\u00ac(F \u2192 S)), we can infer that the fleeg must be bluttered (B).\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The fleeg is bluttered\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
