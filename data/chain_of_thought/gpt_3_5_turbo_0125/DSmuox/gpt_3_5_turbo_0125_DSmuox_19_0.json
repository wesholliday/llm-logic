The only information we have is that it's not the case that the smonk must be plagged and that either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged. This does not definitively determine the status of the smonk being vreebled.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"The smonk is vreebled\" cannot be inferred from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
