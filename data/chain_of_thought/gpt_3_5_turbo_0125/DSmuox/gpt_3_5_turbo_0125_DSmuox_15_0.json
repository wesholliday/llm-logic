Since we know that it's not the case that the dreb must be spened, we can only conclude that the dreb is not required to be spened. However, we cannot definitively determine that the dreb is vroombed based on the given statements.\n\nTherefore, the inference that \"The dreb is vroombed\" cannot be made with certainty from the provided statements.",
