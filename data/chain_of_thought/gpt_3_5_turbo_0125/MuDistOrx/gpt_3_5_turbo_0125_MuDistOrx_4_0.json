When we rephrase it as \"The grazzle must be in the flim or it must be on the grooble,\" we are essentially restating the original statement in a slightly different way. By adding \"it must be\" before \"on the grooble,\" we are emphasizing that one of the two options must be true. Therefore, we can infer that the two statements are equivalent.\n\nAnswer: yes",
