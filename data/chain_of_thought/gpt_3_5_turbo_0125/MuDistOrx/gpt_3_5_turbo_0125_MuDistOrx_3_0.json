When we rephrase it as \"The wumble must be on the frozz or it must be in the shimble,\" we are emphasizing that one of these two options must be true. This rephrased statement still captures the original meaning, as it conveys that the wumble can only be in one of the two places mentioned.\n\nAnswer: yes",
