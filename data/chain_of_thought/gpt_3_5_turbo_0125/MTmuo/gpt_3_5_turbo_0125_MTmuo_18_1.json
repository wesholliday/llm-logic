Let's use the contrapositive of the implication in the second statement: \u00ac(Truck is metal) \u2192 \u00ac(Doll is plastic).\n\nTherefore, combining \u00ac(Truck must have been metal) \u2227 (Doll is plastic \u2192 Truck is metal) with the contrapositive of the implication, we get \u00ac(Truck must have been metal) \u2227 (\u00ac(Truck is metal)).\n\nThis simplifies to \u00ac(Truck must have been metal) \u2227 \u00ac(Truck is metal), which leads to a contradiction.
