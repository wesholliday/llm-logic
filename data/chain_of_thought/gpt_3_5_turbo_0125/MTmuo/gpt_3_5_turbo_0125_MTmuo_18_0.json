If the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If the truck doesn't have to be metal, then the doll doesn't have to be plastic for the second statement to hold true. The first statement allows for the possibility that the truck is not metal, so the doll could still be plastic.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The doll was not plastic\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
