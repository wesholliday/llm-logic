The first statement only tells us that it's not the case that the truck must have been blue, which means the truck could have been any color.\n\nThe second statement tells us that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. This does not provide any information about the actual color of the car, as it only gives a condition for the color of the truck based on the color of the car.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The car was not red\" from the given statements because the information provided does not directly lead to that conclusion.",
