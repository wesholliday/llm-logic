Vampire awake \u2192 Mummy awake\n\nTo infer that the vampire was not awake, we need to show that it is impossible for the vampire to be awake based on the given statements. \n\nIf the mummy was not awake (\u00ac(Mummy awake)), then according to the second statement (Vampire awake \u2192 Mummy awake), it is possible that the vampire was not awake. This is because the conditional statement does not require the consequent (Mummy awake) to be true if the antecedent (Vampire awake) is false.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot definitively infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
