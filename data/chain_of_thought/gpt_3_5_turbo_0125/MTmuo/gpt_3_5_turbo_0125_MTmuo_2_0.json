To do this, we can use proof by contradiction:\n\nAssume G (the griffin was in the forest).\nFrom statement 2, if G -> U, then since we assumed G, we can infer U.\nBut statement 1 says ~U, which contradicts our inference.\nTherefore, our assumption that G was in the forest must be false, leading to the conclusion that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
