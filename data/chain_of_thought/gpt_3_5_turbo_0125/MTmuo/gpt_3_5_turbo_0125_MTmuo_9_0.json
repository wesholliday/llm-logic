However, the second statement implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This means that if Lisa did buy the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt based on the given statements.",
