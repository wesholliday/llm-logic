The given information does not provide any direct information about Mary's presence at the wedding. The statements only provide information about Sue's presence based on Mary's presence, but they do not give any information about Mary's presence independently.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"Mary was not at the wedding\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
