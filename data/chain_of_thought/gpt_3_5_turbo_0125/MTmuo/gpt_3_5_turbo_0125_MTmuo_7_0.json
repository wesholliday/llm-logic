This means that if Alex finished the race, Chris definitely finished the race.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that if Chris did not finish the race, then Alex also did not finish the race. This is because if Alex had finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race according to the second statement. Since we know Chris did not necessarily finish the race, it implies that Alex did not finish the race either.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
