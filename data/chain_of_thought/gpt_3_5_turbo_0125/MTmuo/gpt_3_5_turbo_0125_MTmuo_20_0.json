If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If the banana does not have to be yellow, then the condition in the second statement is not necessarily true. This means that the apple being red does not guarantee that the banana was yellow.\n- Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The apple was not red\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
