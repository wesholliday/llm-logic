To infer \"The zinger was not fraggled,\" we need to consider the contrapositive of the first premise:\n   - \u00acSmoogled \u2192 \u00acFraggled\n\n4. Combining the negation of Smoogled from the second premise with the contrapositive of the first premise, we get:\n   - \u00acSmoogled \u2192 \u00acFraggled\n\n5. Therefore, we can infer that \"The zinger was not fraggled\" based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
