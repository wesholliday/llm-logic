If the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint. (A -> B)\n2. It's not the case that the wug must have bimmed the zoint. (not B)\n\nFrom statement 2, we can infer \"not B\" (the wug did not bim the zoint). \n\nTherefore, by the contrapositive rule, we can infer \"not A\" (the wug was not flooped) from \"not B\" (the wug did not bim the zoint). \n\nSo, yes, we can infer \"The wug was not flooped\" from the given statements. \n\nAnswer: yes",
