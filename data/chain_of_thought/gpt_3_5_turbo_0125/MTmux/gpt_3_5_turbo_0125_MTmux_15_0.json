To infer \"The dreb was not vroombed,\" we need to consider the contrapositive of the first statement:\n   - If not B, then not A (~B -> ~A)\n\n4. Combining the contrapositive of the first statement with the second statement, we get:\n   - If not B, then not A\n   - Not B\n   - Therefore, we can infer Not A\n\nBased on the logical reasoning above, we can infer that \"The dreb was not vroombed\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
