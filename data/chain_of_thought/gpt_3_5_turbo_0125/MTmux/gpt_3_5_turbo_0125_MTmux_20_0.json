We want to infer \"The fleeg was not bluttered\" which can be represented as:\n   - Not A (~A)\n\nTo infer \"The fleeg was not bluttered\" from the given statements, we can use the contrapositive of the first statement:\n- If not B, then not A (~B -> ~A)\n\nCombining the contrapositive of the first statement with the second statement, we get:\n- Not B -> Not A\n\nSince we are given ~B (not B), we can infer ~A (not A) based on the logical implication above.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The fleeg was not bluttered\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
