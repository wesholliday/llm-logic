This is because the absence of nugged does not necessarily mean the absence of plooked. It only tells us that if the shank was plooked, it must have been nugged, but it doesn't tell us anything about the status of plooked when nugged is not the case.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The shank was not plooked\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
