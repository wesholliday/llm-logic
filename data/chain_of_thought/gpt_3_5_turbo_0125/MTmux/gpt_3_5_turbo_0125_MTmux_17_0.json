The contrapositive of the statement \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A.\" \n\nGiven:\n1. If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated. (A -> B)\n2. It's not the case that the flob must have movated. (not B)\n\nContrapositive of (1): If not B, then not A. (not B -> not A)\n\nTherefore, if it's not the case that the flob must have movated (not B), then we can infer that the flob was not skizzled (not A) based on the contrapositive rule.\n\nAnswer: yes",
