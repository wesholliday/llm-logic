To infer \"The splat was not morphed,\" we need to consider the contrapositive of the first statement:\n   - The contrapositive of A -> B is ~B -> ~A\n\n4. Combining the contrapositive with the second statement, we get:\n   - ~B (It's not the case that the splat must have quanked)\n   - Therefore, ~A (The splat was not morphed)\n\nBased on the logical reasoning above, we can infer that \"The splat was not morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
