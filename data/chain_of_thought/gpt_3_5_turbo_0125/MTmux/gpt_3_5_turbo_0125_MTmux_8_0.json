To do this, we can use the contrapositive of the first statement:\n\n- The contrapositive of Cranked -> Daggled is ~Daggled -> ~Cranked\n\nGiven that we have ~Daggled from the second statement, we can infer ~Cranked from the contrapositive of the first statement.\n\nTherefore, the inference \"The sprocket was not cranked\" can be made from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
