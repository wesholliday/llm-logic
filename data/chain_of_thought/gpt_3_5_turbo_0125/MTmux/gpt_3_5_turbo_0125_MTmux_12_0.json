To infer \"The smip was not shripped,\" we need to consider the contrapositive of the first statement:\n   - If not B, then not A (~B -> ~A)\n\n4. Combining the contrapositive of the first statement and the second statement, we get:\n   - If not B, then not A (from the contrapositive)\n   - Not B (~B)\n\n5. Therefore, we can infer \"The smip was not shripped\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
