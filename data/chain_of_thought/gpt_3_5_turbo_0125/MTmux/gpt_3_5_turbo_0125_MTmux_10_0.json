To do this, we can use the contrapositive of the first statement:\n\n- The contrapositive of \"Sproinged -> Garpled\" is \"~Garpled -> ~Sproinged\"\n\nGiven that we have \"~Garpled\" from the second statement, we can infer \"~Sproinged\" based on the contrapositive.\n\nTherefore, the inference \"The wug was not sproinged\" can be made from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
