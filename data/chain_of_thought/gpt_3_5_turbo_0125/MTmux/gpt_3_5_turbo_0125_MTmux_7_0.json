We want to infer \"The whiffle was not shanked\" which can be represented as:\n   - Not A (~A)\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n- From statement 1, if the whiffle was shanked (A), then it must have tinked (B).\n- From statement 2, it's not the case that the whiffle must have tinked (~B).\n\nGiven the statements, we cannot directly infer that the whiffle was not shanked because the absence of the consequence (B) does not necessarily mean the absence of the condition (A). The statements do not provide enough information to conclude that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nTherefore, the inference \"The whiffle was not shanked\" cannot be made based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
