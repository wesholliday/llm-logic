To do this, we can use the contrapositive of the first statement:\n\n- Contrapositive of Crampled sneg -> Sproted frink is \u00acSproted frink -> \u00acCrampled sneg\n\nSince we know \u00ac(Sproted frink) from the second statement, we can conclude \u00acCrampled sneg.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The sneg was not crampled\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
