This means that if the fribble was not crinked, it was not snurgled.\n\nThe second statement tells us that it is not the case that the fribble must have crinked. This means that the fribble was not necessarily crinked.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that the fribble was not snurgled because if it was snurgled, it must have been crinked, which contradicts the second statement that it is not the case that the fribble must have crinked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The fribble was not snurgled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
