This means that the shank could be plooked or not nugged at all.\n\nThe second statement tells us that either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged. This means that if the shank is not nugged, then it must be plooked.\n\nCombining the two statements, we can conclude that if the shank is not nugged, then it must be plooked. However, we cannot definitively infer that the shank is plooked because there is still a possibility that the shank is not nugged.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that 'The shank is plooked' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
