It implies that if the whiffle is not shanked, then it must be tinked.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer the following:\n\n- If the whiffle is not tinked, then it must be shanked according to the second statement.\n- The first statement allows for the possibility that the whiffle is not tinked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The whiffle is shanked\" based on the information provided. The possibility remains that the whiffle is not tinked.",
