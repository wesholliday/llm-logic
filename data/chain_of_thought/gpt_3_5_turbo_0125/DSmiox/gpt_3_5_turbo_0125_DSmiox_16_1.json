Either the sneg is crampled or it must be sproted.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The sneg is crampled,\" we can analyze the statements:\n\nFrom (1), we know that the sneg might not be sproted. This implies the possibility that the sneg is not sproted.\n\nFrom (2), we know that either the sneg is crampled or it must be sproted. This indicates that one of these must be true, or both.\n\nIf the sneg is not sproted (from 1), then it must be crampled (from 2) based on the second statement's logic. This is because the statement says either the sneg is crampled or it must be sproted.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The sneg is crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
