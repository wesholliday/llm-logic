It implies that if the sneg is not sproted, then it must be crampled.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer the following:\n\n- If the sneg is not sproted, then it must be crampled based on the second statement.\n- The first statement indicates that there is a possibility that the sneg is not sproted.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The sneg is crampled\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
