Since we are given that the mummy was awake (second statement), it does not necessarily mean that the vampire was awake. The first statement only establishes a condition for the mummy being awake when the vampire is awake, but it does not provide any information about the vampire's state when the mummy is awake.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
