The given statement is: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" (P \u2192 Q).\n2. Another given statement is: \"The wolf was in the den\" (Q).\n\nFrom the given information, we know that if the bear was in the cave (P), then the wolf was in the den (Q). We are also given that the wolf was indeed in the den (Q).\n\nNow, if we know that the wolf was in the den (Q), can we conclude that the bear was in the cave (P)? This is a valid conclusion based on the logical implication given in the first statement. If the condition (P) is true and the consequent (Q) is true, then the implication is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can conclude that \"The bear was in the cave\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
