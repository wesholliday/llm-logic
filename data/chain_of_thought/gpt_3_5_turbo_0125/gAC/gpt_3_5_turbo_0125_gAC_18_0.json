This means that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. However, this statement does not provide any information about the doll if the truck is metal.\n\n2. \"The truck was metal\" is a simple statement that tells us the truck is indeed made of metal.\n\nGiven the information provided, we cannot definitively conclude that the doll was plastic based solely on the fact that the truck was metal. The first statement only tells us about the relationship between the doll and the truck if the doll is plastic. Since we do not have any information about the doll in this scenario, we cannot make a definite conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"The doll was plastic\" cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
