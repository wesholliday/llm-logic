The statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is a conditional statement. It means that if the cake being chocolate is true, then the muffins being blueberry must also be true.\n\n2. The statement \"The muffins were blueberry\" is given as true.\n\n3. From the given information, we know that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. Since we know the muffins were blueberry, it does not necessarily mean that the cake was chocolate. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if the cake is chocolate, not the other way around.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that the cake was chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no",
