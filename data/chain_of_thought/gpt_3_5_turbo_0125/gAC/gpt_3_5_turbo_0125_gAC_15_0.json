The statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is a conditional statement. It can be represented as: Sam (P) -> Erin (Q).\n\n2. The statement \"Erin took a train\" is true. This means Q is true.\n\n3. From the conditional statement, if Q is true, it does not necessarily mean that P is true. The conditional statement only guarantees that if P is true, then Q is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that Sam took a plane. \n\nAnswer: no",
