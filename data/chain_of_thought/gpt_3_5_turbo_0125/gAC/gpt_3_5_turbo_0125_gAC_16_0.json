It means that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim. This statement does not tell us anything about the shirt if the condition is not met.\n\n2. \"The pants were denim\" - This statement is a fact given to us.\n\nSince the second statement tells us that the pants were denim, it satisfies the condition in the first statement. However, the first statement does not provide any information about what happens if the condition is not met. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the shirt was cotton based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
