The statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is a conditional statement. It means that if Alex finished the race, then Chris also finished the race. This statement does not provide any information about whether Alex actually finished the race.\n\n2. The statement \"Chris finished the race\" is given as true. This means that Chris did finish the race.\n\nGiven the information provided, we cannot definitively conclude whether Alex finished the race or not. Just because Chris finished the race does not necessarily mean that Alex also finished the race. Alex could have finished the race or not finished the race. The information provided does not directly confirm Alex's completion of the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
