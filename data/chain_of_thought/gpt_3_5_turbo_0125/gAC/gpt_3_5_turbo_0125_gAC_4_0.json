Since the second statement confirms that the robot did indeed visit Jupiter, we can conclude that the first statement is satisfied. However, we cannot definitively conclude that the alien visited Mars based solely on this information.\n\nTherefore, the statement 'The alien visited Mars' cannot be determined to be true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
