The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement. It can be represented as: If A (apple was red), then B (banana was yellow).\n\n2. The statement \"The banana was yellow\" is true. This means B (banana was yellow) is true.\n\n3. From the given information, we know that if the apple was red (A), then the banana was yellow (B). Since B is true, it does not necessarily mean that A is true. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if A is true, not the other way around.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that \"The apple was red\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
