            "content": "To determine if the statement 'Mary was at the wedding' is true based on the given information, we need to consider the logical relationship between the statements provided. \n\n1. The first statement given is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is true. This is a conditional statement in the form of \"if-then.\" It means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. This statement does not provide any information about whether Mary was actually at the wedding.\n\n2. The second statement given is 'Sue was at the wedding' is true. This statement directly tells us that Sue was indeed at the wedding.\n\nGiven these two statements, we know that Sue was at the wedding. However, we cannot definitively conclude that Mary was at the wedding based solely on the information provided. Just because Sue was at the wedding does not necessarily mean that Mary was also there. Mary could have been at the wedding, or she could have been somewhere else.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively say that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
