The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement. It means that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. This statement does not provide any information about the color of the car if the truck is blue.\n\n2. The statement \"The truck was blue\" is a simple statement that tells us the color of the truck.\n\nGiven that the truck is blue, we cannot definitively conclude the color of the car based on the information provided. The fact that the truck is blue does not necessarily mean that the car is red. The car could be red or any other color.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively say that \"The car was red\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
