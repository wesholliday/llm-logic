The first statement given is: 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.' This is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q.\" In this case, P is \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q is \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\n2. The second statement given is: 'Bob chose pasta.' This statement is independent of the first statement and simply provides information about Bob's choice.\n\nGiven that Bob chose pasta, we know that the second part of the conditional statement is true (Q is true). However, this does not provide any information about whether the first part of the conditional statement is true (P is true). It is possible that Sue did not choose pizza, as the conditional statement only tells us what happens if she did choose pizza.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that Sue chose pizza. \n\nAnswer: no",
