Since we are given that Mark bought the blue shirt, it does not necessarily mean that Lisa bought the red shirt. The first statement only establishes a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. It does not provide any information about Lisa's purchase if Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
