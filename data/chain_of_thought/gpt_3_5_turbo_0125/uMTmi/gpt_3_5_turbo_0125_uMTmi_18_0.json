The truck might not have been metal.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. This implies that if the truck was not metal, then the doll could not have been plastic.\n\nFrom statement 2, we are given that the truck might not have been metal. This means that the truck could have been made of a material other than metal.\n\nCombining both statements, we can conclude that since the truck might not have been metal, the doll cannot be inferred to be plastic. This is because the condition for the doll being plastic (which would require the truck to be metal) is not met.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the doll was not necessarily plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
