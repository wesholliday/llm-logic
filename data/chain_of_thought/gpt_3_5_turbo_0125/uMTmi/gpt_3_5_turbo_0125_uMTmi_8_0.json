The mummy might not have been awake.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake. This means that the mummy being awake is a necessary condition for the vampire being awake.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the mummy might not have been awake. This means that the mummy being awake is not a guaranteed condition.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively infer that the vampire was not awake. The mummy being awake is a necessary condition for the vampire being awake, but it is not a sufficient condition. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the vampire was not awake based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
