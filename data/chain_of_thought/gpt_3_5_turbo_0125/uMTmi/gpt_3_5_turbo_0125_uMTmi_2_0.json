The unicorn might not have been in the forest.\n\nFrom statement 1, if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest. This implies that the presence of the griffin in the forest guarantees the presence of the unicorn in the forest.\n\nFrom statement 2, it is possible that the unicorn was not in the forest. This means that the unicorn's presence in the forest is not guaranteed.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively infer that the griffin was not in the forest. The presence of the unicorn in the forest is not certain, so we cannot make a conclusive deduction about the griffin's location based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
