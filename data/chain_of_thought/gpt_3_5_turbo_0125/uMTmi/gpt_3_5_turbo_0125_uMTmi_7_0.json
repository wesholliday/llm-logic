If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\n2. Chris might not have finished the race.\n\nFrom the first statement, if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race. However, the second statement suggests that Chris might not have finished the race, which means there is a possibility that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nGiven these statements, we cannot definitively infer that Alex did not finish the race. It is possible that both Alex and Chris finished the race, or it is also possible that Alex did not finish the race. The information provided does not allow us to make a conclusive inference about Alex's finishing status.\n\nAnswer: no",
