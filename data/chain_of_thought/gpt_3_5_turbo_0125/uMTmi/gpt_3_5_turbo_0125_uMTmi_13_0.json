The truck might not have been blue.\n\nFrom statement 1, if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. This implies a conditional relationship between the color of the car and the color of the truck.\n\nFrom statement 2, it is mentioned that the truck might not have been blue, which means there is a possibility that the truck was not blue.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively infer that the car was not red. The information provided does not give us enough evidence to determine the color of the car with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no",
