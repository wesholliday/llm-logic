The robot might not have visited Jupiter.\n\nGiven statement 1 implies that if the alien visited Mars, the robot must have visited Jupiter. This means that these two events are linked: if one occurs, the other must also occur.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement. If the robot might not have visited Jupiter, it implies that we are not sure if the robot actually visited Jupiter or not. This possibility leaves room for the robot to have either visited or not visited Jupiter.\n\nCombining the two statements, we see that if the robot might not have visited Jupiter, it doesn't necessarily mean that the alien did not visit Mars. The alien could have still visited Mars even if there is uncertainty about the robot's visit to Jupiter.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the alien did not visit Mars based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
