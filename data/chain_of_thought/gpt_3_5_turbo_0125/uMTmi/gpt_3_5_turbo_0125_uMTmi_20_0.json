The banana might not have been yellow.\n\nFrom statement 1, if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. This means that if the apple was red, the banana cannot be any other color than yellow.\n\nFrom statement 2, it is possible that the banana was not yellow. This means that the banana could have been a different color.\n\nCombining these statements, if the banana might not have been yellow, then the initial condition that the apple was red cannot be true. If the banana was not yellow, then the apple could not have been red because the first statement requires the banana to be yellow if the apple is red.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
