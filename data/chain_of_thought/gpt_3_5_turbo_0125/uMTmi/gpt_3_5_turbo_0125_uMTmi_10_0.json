The cat might not have been outside.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside. However, statement 2 introduces uncertainty by saying the cat might not have been outside. This means that the cat's location is not definitively known.\n\nGiven this information, we cannot definitively infer that the dog was not inside. The possibility remains that the dog was inside, and the cat was also inside or outside.",
