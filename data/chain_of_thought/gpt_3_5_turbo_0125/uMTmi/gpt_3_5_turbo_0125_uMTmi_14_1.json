If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\n2. The wolf might not have been in the den.\n\nBased on the first statement, if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den. This means that the presence of the bear in the cave implies the presence of the wolf in the den.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement that the wolf might not have been in the den. This contradicts the implication from the first statement, as it suggests that the wolf may not have been in the den even if the bear was in the cave.\n\nThus, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the bear was not in the cave because the second statement introduces uncertainty about the wolf's location regardless of the bear's presence in the cave.\n\nAnswer: no",
