If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n2. Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\n\nFrom the first statement, if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. However, the second statement introduces uncertainty by saying that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\n\nGiven this information, we cannot definitively infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. It is possible that Lisa bought the red shirt, and Mark did not buy the blue shirt as well.\n\nAnswer: no",
