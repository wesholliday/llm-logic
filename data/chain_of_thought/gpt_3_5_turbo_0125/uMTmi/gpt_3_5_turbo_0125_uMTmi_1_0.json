If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\n2. Sue might not have been at the wedding.\n\nFrom the first statement, if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This means that if Mary attended, Sue also attended.\n\nThe second statement says that Sue might not have been at the wedding, which means there is a possibility that Sue did not attend.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that if Sue might not have been at the wedding, then Mary could have also not been at the wedding. However, we cannot definitively infer that Mary was not at the wedding because there is a possibility that both Mary and Sue did not attend.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
