The robot might not have visited Jupiter.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. However, statement 2 introduces uncertainty by saying that the robot might not have visited Jupiter. This means that even though the robot could have visited Jupiter, there is a possibility that it did not.\n\nGiven these statements, we cannot definitively infer that the alien did not visit Mars. The robot's visit to Jupiter is uncertain, so we cannot make a conclusive deduction about the alien's visit to Mars based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
