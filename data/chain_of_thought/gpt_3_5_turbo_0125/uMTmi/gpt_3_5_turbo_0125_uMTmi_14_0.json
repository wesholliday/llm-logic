If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\n2. The wolf might not have been in the den.\n\nFrom the first statement, if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den. However, the second statement introduces uncertainty by saying the wolf might not have been in the den. This means that the wolf could have been somewhere else, not necessarily in the den.\n\nGiven this information, we cannot definitively infer that the bear was not in the cave. The possibility remains that the bear was in the cave, and the wolf was not in the den but somewhere else.\n\nAnswer: no",
