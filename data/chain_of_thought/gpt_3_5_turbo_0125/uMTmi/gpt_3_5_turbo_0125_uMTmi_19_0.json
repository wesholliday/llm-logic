Jen might not have watched basketball.\n\nFrom the first statement, if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. However, the second statement says that Jen might not have watched basketball, which means there is a possibility that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nTherefore, since there is a possibility that Jen did not watch basketball, we cannot definitively infer that Tom did not watch football. Tom could have watched football, and Jen may or may not have watched basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
