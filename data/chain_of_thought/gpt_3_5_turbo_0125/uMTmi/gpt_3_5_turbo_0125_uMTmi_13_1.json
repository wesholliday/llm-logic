The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\" indicates a conditional relationship between the car being red and the truck being blue. This means if the car is red, then the truck is blue.\n\n2. The statement \"The truck might not have been blue.\" introduces the possibility that the truck was not blue, despite the initial conditional relationship.\n\nConsidering these points, since the truck might not have been blue, we can't definitively infer that the car was not red. The second statement leaves the possibility open that the truck was a different color, thus not necessarily contradicting the initial condition that the car was red. Therefore, we cannot infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: no",
