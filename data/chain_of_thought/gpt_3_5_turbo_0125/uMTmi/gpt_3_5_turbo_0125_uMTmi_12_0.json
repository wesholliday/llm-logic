Lucy might not have gone to the zoo.\n\nFrom the first statement, if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. However, the second statement introduces uncertainty by saying Lucy might not have gone to the zoo. This means that even if Joe went to the park, Lucy might not have gone to the zoo.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Joe did not go to the park based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
