If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\n2. The book might not be a mystery novel.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. This means that all books written by James are mystery novels.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the book might not be a mystery novel, which implies that there are books that are not mystery novels.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that if the book is not a mystery novel, then it was not written by James. This is because all books written by James are mystery novels, and if the book is not a mystery novel, it cannot have been written by James.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
