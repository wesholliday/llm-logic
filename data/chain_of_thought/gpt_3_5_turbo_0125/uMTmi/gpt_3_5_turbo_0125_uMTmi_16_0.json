The pants might not have been denim.\n\nFrom the first statement, if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. However, the second statement allows for the possibility that the pants were not denim. This means that the first statement does not necessarily have to be true.\n\nGiven this information, we cannot definitively infer that the shirt was not cotton. It is still possible that the shirt was cotton, but the pants were not denim.\n\nAnswer: no",
