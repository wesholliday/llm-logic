The antecedent is \"the shirt was cotton\" and the consequent is \"the pants were denim.\" If this conditional statement is true and the consequent \"The pants were denim\" is true, it does not provide us with any information about the antecedent (the shirt being cotton). The conditional being true only tells us about the relationship between cotton shirts and denim pants, not specifically about this scenario.\n\n2. Given that the pants were denim, we know this specific piece of information is true.\n\nSince the statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" does not provide direct information about whether the shirt was actually cotton or not in this specific instance, knowing the pants were denim alone does not necessarily mean the shirt was cotton. The shirt could be any material, including cotton, but the information provided does not unequivocally determine the material of the shirt.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that \"The shirt was cotton\" is true. \n\nAnswer: no",
