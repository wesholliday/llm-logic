We also know that the robot visited Jupiter. However, we cannot definitively conclude that the alien visited Mars based on this information alone. The statement \"If A, then B\" does not necessarily mean that if B is true, then A is also true. It only establishes a relationship between A and B.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively say that the alien visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: no",
