It does not say anything about what happens if Jen watched basketball.\n\n2. \"Jen watched basketball\" is true. This tells us that Jen actually watched basketball.\n\nFrom the information given, we know that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. We also know that Jen watched basketball. However, the information does not conclusively tell us if Tom watched football or not. Tom could have watched football as the conditional statement allows for it, but it is also possible that Tom did not watch football.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"Tom watched football\" is not necessarily true based on the information given. \n\nAnswer: no",
