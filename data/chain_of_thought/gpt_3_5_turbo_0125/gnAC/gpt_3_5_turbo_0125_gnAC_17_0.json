This statement does not provide any information about whether Ben actually ate pasta, only that if he did, then Kate ate salad.\n\nThe second statement is a simple statement: 'Kate ate salad.' This statement tells us that Kate did indeed eat salad.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude that Ben ate pasta. The fact that Kate ate salad does not necessarily mean that Ben ate pasta. Ben could have eaten something else or not eaten at all. \n\nTherefore, the statement 'Ben ate pasta' is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
