This statement is given as true.\n\n2. \"The truck was metal\" - This statement is also given as true.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. We are also given that the truck is metal. However, we cannot definitively conclude that the doll is plastic based solely on this information. The conditional statement does not provide information about what happens if the doll is not plastic.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that 'The doll was plastic' is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
