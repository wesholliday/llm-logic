The given conditional statement is: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" (If A, then C).\n2. It is given that Chris finished the race (C is true).\n\nFrom the given information, we know that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. Since we also know that Chris finished the race, it does not necessarily mean that Alex finished the race. Chris could have finished the race for reasons other than Alex finishing the race.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively conclude that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
