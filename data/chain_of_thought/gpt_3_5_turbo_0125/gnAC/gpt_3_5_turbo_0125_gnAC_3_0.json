This means that if the book was indeed written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. However, this does not tell us anything about books written by other authors being mystery novels.\n\n2. \"The book is a mystery novel\" is a statement that tells us the genre of the book, but it does not provide any information about the author.\n\nGiven the information provided, we cannot definitively conclude that the book was written by James just because it is a mystery novel. It is possible that the book was written by someone other than James and still falls into the category of a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that 'The book was written by James' is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
