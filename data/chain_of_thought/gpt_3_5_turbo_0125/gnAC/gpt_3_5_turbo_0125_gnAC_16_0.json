It means that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim. This statement does not tell us anything about what happens if the pants are denim.\n\n2. \"The pants were denim\" - This is a statement that tells us the pants were denim.\n\nGiven these two statements, we know that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. We also know that the pants were denim. However, we do not have any information about what happens if the pants were not denim. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the shirt was cotton based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
