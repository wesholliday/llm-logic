The statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' being true means that whenever Mary is at the wedding, Sue is also at the wedding. This does not necessarily mean that Mary must be at the wedding for Sue to be there.\n\n2. The statement 'Sue was at the wedding' is true, which confirms that Sue was indeed at the wedding.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude that Mary was at the wedding. It is possible that Mary was not at the wedding, but Sue was there for some other reason. \n\nAnswer: no",
