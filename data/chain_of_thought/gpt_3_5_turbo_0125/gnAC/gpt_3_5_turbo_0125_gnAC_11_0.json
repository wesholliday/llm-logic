The statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is a conditional statement. It means that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. This statement does not provide any information about what happens if the cake is not chocolate.\n\n2. The statement \"The muffins were blueberry\" is a simple statement that tells us the flavor of the muffins.\n\nGiven these two statements, we know that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry. We also know that the muffins are indeed blueberry. However, we do not have any information about what happens if the cake is not chocolate. It is possible that the cake is not chocolate and the muffins are still blueberry (for example, if there are multiple flavors of cake available).\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that \"The cake was chocolate\" is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
