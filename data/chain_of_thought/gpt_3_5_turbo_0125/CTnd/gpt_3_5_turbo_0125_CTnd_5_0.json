The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nSo, the contrapositive of the original statement is: If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was cleaned.\n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive of the original statement with the second statement we want to infer:\n\nContrapositive of the original statement: If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was cleaned.\nSecond statement: If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned.\n\nSince the contrapositive of the original statement does not match the second statement we want to infer, we cannot directly infer the second statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
