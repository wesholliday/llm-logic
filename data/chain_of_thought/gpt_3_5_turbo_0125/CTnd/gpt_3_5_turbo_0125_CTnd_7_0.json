The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nIn this case, the original statement is \"If the customer was served, then he was not served promptly.\" The contrapositive of this statement would be \"If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer the statement 'If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served' from the given statement 'If the customer was served, then he was not served promptly.'\n\nAnswer: yes",
