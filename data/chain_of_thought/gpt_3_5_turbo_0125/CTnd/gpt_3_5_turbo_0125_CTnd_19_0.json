The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nIn this case, the original statement is \"If directions were provided, then they were not explained clearly.\" The contrapositive of this statement would be \"If directions were explained clearly, then they were not provided.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer the statement \"If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
