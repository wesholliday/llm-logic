The original statement talks about the meal being prepared but not carefully, while the proposed inference talks about the meal being prepared carefully. These are two different scenarios.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement 'If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared' from the original statement 'If the meal was prepared, then it was not prepared carefully.'\n\nAnswer: no",
