The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then not Q.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If Q, then not P.\" \n\nGiven the contrapositive relationship, we can infer the second statement from the first. This is because if we negate the consequent (Q) and the antecedent (P) of the original conditional statement, we get the contrapositive statement. Therefore, if Ben studied diligently (Q), then he did not study (not P) can be inferred from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
