This is known as the contrapositive.\n\nThe contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of the original statement is: 'If the job was completed well, then it was not completed'.\n\nSo, yes, we can infer the statement 'If the job was completed well, then it was not completed' from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: yes",
