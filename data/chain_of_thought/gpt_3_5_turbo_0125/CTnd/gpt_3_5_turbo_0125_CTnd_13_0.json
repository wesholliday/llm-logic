The contrapositive of the original statement is: B -> \u00acA (If B, then \u00acA).\n\nComparing the contrapositive of the original statement (B -> \u00acA) with the second statement (B -> \u00acC), we see that they are not equivalent. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
