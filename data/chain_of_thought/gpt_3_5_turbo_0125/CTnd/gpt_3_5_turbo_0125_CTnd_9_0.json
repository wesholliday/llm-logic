            "content": "To determine if we can infer the statement \"If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given\" from the original statement \"If instructions were given, then they were not explained clearly,\" we need to analyze the logic involved.\n\nThe original statement is in the form \"If A, then B.\" This means that whenever A happens, B also happens. In this case, A is \"instructions were given\" and B is \"they were not explained clearly.\"\n\nTo infer the statement \"If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given,\" we would need to reverse the original statement. This is known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of the original statement would be: \"If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were given.\"\n\nSo, the statement \"If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were given\" is the correct contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
