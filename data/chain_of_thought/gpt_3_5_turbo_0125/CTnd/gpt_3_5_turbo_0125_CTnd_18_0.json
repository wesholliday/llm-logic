If the issue was discussed (A), then it was not discussed in depth (~B).\n\nThe proposed inference is: \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed.\"\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n2. If the issue was discussed in depth (B), then it was not discussed (~A).\n\nNow, let's compare the original statement and the proposed inference:\n\n- The original statement states that if the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth.\n- The proposed inference states that if the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed.\n\nBy comparing the two statements, we can see that the proposed inference is not the logical contrapositive of the original statement. In the original statement, the absence of discussing in depth is linked to the presence of discussion. However, the proposed inference links the absence of discussion to the presence of discussing in depth.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed\" from the original statement.",
