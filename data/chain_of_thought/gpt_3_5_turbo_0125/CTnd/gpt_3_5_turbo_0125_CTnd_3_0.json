The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then switching their positions.\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement is: Ate a large meal \u2192 Did not eat a meal.\n\nTherefore, based on the contrapositive of the original statement, we can infer 'If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
