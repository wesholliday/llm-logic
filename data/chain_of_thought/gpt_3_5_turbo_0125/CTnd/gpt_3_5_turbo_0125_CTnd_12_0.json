The contrapositive of p \u2192 q is \u00acq \u2192 \u00acp.\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of 'If Jane studied, then she did not study long' is: \n\u00ac\u00acq \u2192 \u00acp\nq \u2192 \u00acp\n\nThis means that if Jane studied long (q), then she did not study (\u00acp). \n\nSo, based on the logical relationship between the original statement and its contrapositive, we can infer that 'If Jane studied long, then she did not study'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
