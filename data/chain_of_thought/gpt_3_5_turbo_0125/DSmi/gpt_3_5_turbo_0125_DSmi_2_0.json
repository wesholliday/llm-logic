The first statement is: 'Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.'\n2. The second statement is: 'The book might not be resting on the table.'\n\nCombining these two statements, we can see that if the book is not resting on the table, then it must be on the shelf according to the first statement. However, we cannot definitively conclude that the book is on the shelf because there is still a possibility that the book is neither on the shelf nor on the table.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that 'The book is on the shelf' based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
