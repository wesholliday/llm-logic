It does not provide a definitive location for the watch.\n\n2. \"The watch might not be on his wrist\" - This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the watch is not on his wrist.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer the following possibilities:\n- The watch is charging on the dresser.\n- The watch is not on his wrist.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.",
