The statement \"Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch\" provides two possibilities: the newspaper is in the driveway or it is on the porch.\n2. The statement \"The newspaper might not be sitting on the porch\" eliminates the possibility that the newspaper is on the porch.\n3. Given that the newspaper is not on the porch, we can conclude that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nTherefore, the inference that \"The newspaper is in the driveway\" can be made based on the provided statements. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
