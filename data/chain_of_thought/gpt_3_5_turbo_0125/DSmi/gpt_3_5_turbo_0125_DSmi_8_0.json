If it is not under the couch, then it must be on the coffee table according to the first statement.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the remote control might not be under the couch, which means it could be on the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
