So, if the cat is not playing in the bedroom, then it must be napping on the couch.\n\n2. \"The cat might not be playing in the bedroom\" - This statement supports the first statement by eliminating the possibility of the cat playing in the bedroom.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
