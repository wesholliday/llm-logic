The first statement is: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\"\n\nCombining these two statements, we can see that if the sunglasses are not perched on her head (as indicated in the second statement), then according to the first statement, they must be in her bag. This is because the first statement states that the sunglasses are either in her bag or perched on her head, and the second statement rules out the possibility of them being perched on her head.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
