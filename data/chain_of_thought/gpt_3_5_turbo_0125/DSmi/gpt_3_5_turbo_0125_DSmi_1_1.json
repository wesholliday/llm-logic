The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" is an example of a logical statement using the \"or\" connective. This statement tells us that one of the two options must be true.\n2. The second statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden.\n\nNow, combining the two statements:\n\n- If we interpret the first statement as meaning that Fido is either inside or in the garden, and the second statement suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, then it could be the case that Fido is inside. This is because if Fido is not in the garden (as suggested by the second statement) and Fido must be either inside or in the garden (as per the first statement), then it follows that Fido would be inside.\n\nBy considering the logic behind the statements, we can infer that \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",

This means at least one of the options is true, but not necessarily both.\n\nStatement 2, \"Fido might not be in the garden\", implies that there is doubt or uncertainty about whether Fido is in the garden.\n\nGiven these statements, we cannot definitively infer that \"Fido is inside\". While it is true that Fido must be in either inside or the garden according to statement 1, the presence of doubt about Fido being in the garden in statement 2 leaves room for Fido to be in the garden instead of inside.\n\nTherefore, we cannot necessarily conclude that Fido is inside based on these statements.",
