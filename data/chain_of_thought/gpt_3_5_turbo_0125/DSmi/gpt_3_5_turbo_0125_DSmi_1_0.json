This is because the statement presents a situation where Fido is either inside or in the garden.\n\nThe second statement tells us that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden.\n\nCombining the two statements, we can conclude that if Fido is not in the garden (as indicated by the second statement), then he must be inside (as indicated by the first statement). \n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"Fido is inside.\"",
