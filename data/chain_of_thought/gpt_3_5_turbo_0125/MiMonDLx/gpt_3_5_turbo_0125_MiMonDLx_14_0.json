In this case, the statement \"The zibble might snork frozz\" is part of the statement \"The zibble might snork frozz or be in flibbit wump.\" Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first one because if the zibble might snork frozz, then it satisfies the condition for the entire statement to be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
