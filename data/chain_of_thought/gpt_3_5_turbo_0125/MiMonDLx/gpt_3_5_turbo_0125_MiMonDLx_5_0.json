In this case, the statement \"The zibble might be wozzle or snork\" includes the possibility that the zibble is wozzle. Since the original statement \"The zibble might be wozzle\" fits within the possibilities of the new statement, we can infer that \"The zibble might be wozzle or snork\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
