However, if A is false, we cannot make any conclusions about B. In this case, the statement \"The quibble might be blurble\" does not exclude the possibility of the quibble being something else, like plimp. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The quibble might be blurble or plimp\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
