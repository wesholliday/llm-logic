In this case, the original statement is \"The quank might quazzle the floob.\" If we add \"or zizz\" to the end, the new statement becomes \"The quank might quazzle the floob or zizz.\" Since the original statement does not mention anything about zizz, we cannot infer that the quank might quazzle the floob or zizz based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
