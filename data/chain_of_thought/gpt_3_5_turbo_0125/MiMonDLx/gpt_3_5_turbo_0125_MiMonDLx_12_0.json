In this case, the statement \"The snorkel might be flim or gronk\" includes the possibility that the snorkel is either flim or gronk, or even both. Since we know that \"The snorkel might be flim\" is true, it is possible that the snorkel is flim, which would make the statement \"The snorkel might be flim or gronk\" true as well.\n\nAnswer: yes",
