The contrapositive of \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" is \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\" \n\nGiven that \"Sue might not have been at the wedding,\" we can conclude that Mary was not at the wedding based on the contrapositive statement.\n\nTherefore, the inference that Mary was not at the wedding is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
