This is a conditional statement.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the unicorn might not have been in the forest. This means there is a possibility that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude that the griffin was not in the forest. The first statement only tells us about the relationship between the griffin and the unicorn in the forest, but it does not provide information about the griffin's location if the unicorn is not in the forest.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the griffin was not in the forest based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
