This forms a conditional statement.\n\nNow, let's consider both possibilities regarding the robot's visit to Jupiter:\n\na. If the robot did visit Jupiter:\n   - Based on the conditional statement, this implies the alien visited Mars.\n\nb. If the robot did not visit Jupiter:\n   - This aligns with the second statement that the robot might not have visited Jupiter. However, this doesn't provide direct information about the alien or its visit to Mars.\n\nConsidering the logic carefully, we see that no direct inference can be made about whether the alien visited Mars solely from the given information. The given statements do not definitively support the claim that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'no'. \n\n**Answer:** no",
