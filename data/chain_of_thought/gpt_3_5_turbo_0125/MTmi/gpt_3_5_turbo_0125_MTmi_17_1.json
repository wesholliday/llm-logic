First statement: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\"\n   - This statement implies that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate definitely ate salad.\n   - The contrapositive of this statement is \"If Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n\n2. Second statement: \"Kate might not have eaten salad.\"\n   - This statement implies that it is possible that Kate did not eat salad. It does not conclusively state that Kate did not eat salad, just that it is a possibility.\n\nBased on the given statements and the contrapositive of the first statement, we can conclude the following:\n- If Kate did not eat salad (as per the possibility mentioned), then Ben did not eat pasta (contrapositive of the first statement).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'Ben did not eat pasta' based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
