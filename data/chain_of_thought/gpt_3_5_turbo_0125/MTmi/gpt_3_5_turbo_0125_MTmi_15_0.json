However, the second statement suggests that Erin might not have taken a train, which means there is a possibility that Erin did not take a train.\n\nGiven these statements, we cannot definitively conclude that Sam did not take a plane because there is still a possibility that Erin did not take a train. Therefore, we cannot infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: no",
