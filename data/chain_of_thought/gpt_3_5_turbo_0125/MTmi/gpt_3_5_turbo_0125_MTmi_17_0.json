The first statement is: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"Kate might not have eaten salad.\"\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer the following:\n- If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\n- Kate might not have eaten salad.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n- If Kate might not have eaten salad, it means that the condition \"Kate must have eaten salad\" in the first statement is not necessarily true.\n- Since the first statement is conditional (\"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad\"), and the necessary condition for Kate to have eaten salad is not met, we cannot definitively conclude whether Ben ate pasta or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that 'Ben did not eat pasta' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
