The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\" implies that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal.\n2. The statement \"The truck might not have been metal\" suggests that it is possible that the truck was not metal.\n3. Combining the two statements, we know that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. However, it is also possible that the truck was not metal.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot definitively infer that the doll was not plastic. The possibility remains that the doll could be plastic, and the truck may or may not be metal.\n\nAnswer: no",
