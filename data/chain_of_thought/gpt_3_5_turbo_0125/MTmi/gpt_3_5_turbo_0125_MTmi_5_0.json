The first statement is: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"Amy might not have played tennis.\"\n\nGiven these statements, we can reason as follows:\n- If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. This is a conditional statement, meaning if the first part is true (Jeff played basketball), then the second part must also be true (Amy played tennis).\n- The second statement says that Amy might not have played tennis, which means there is a possibility that Amy did not play tennis.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that:\n- If Amy might not have played tennis, then the condition for the first statement (Jeff playing basketball) is not met. This means we cannot definitively say whether Jeff played basketball or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that 'Jeff did not play basketball' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
