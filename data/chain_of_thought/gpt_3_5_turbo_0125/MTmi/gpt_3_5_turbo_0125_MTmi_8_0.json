This means that the mummy being awake is a necessary condition for the vampire to be awake.\n\nFrom statement 2, we are given that the mummy might not have been awake, which means there is a possibility that the mummy was not awake.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude that the vampire was not awake. It is possible that the mummy was not awake, but we cannot definitively determine the state of the vampire based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
