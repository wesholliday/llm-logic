This means that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\n2. \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt\" suggests that there is a possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This statement does not provide a definitive answer about whether Mark bought the blue shirt or not.\n\nGiven these statements, we cannot definitively infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt based on the information provided. The possibility remains that Lisa bought the red shirt, and Mark may or may not have bought the blue shirt.",
