            "content": "To determine if we can infer that Tom did not watch football based on the given statements, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\" - This statement implies that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. This does not provide any information about whether Tom actually watched football or not.\n\n2. \"Jen might not have watched basketball\" - This statement suggests that there is a possibility that Jen did not watch basketball. This does not provide any direct information about Tom watching football.\n\nCombining the two statements, we can see that there is no direct link between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball. The fact that Jen might not have watched basketball does not necessarily mean that Tom did not watch football. Therefore, we cannot infer that Tom did not watch football based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
