            "content": "To determine if we can infer that Joe did not go to the park, we need to consider the logical relationship between the statements provided.\n\n1. \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" - This statement establishes a conditional relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo. It implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\n2. \"Lucy might not have gone to the zoo\" - This statement suggests that there is a possibility that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If Joe went to the park (based on the first statement), then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n- However, since it is possible that Lucy did not go to the zoo (based on the second statement), it means that the condition for Joe going to the park (Lucy going to the zoo) might not have been met.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
