This does not provide us with direct information about the vampire's state, only a relationship with the mummy. It does not definitively tell us anything about the vampire's state in isolation.\n\nWhen combining statement 1 with statement 2, which suggests that the mummy might not have been awake, it leads to a contradiction with the information given in statement 1. If the mummy might not have been awake, it contradicts the initial conditional statement which states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\n\nHowever, this contradiction does not necessarily imply that the vampire was not awake.
