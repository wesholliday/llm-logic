Chris might not have finished the race.\n\nGiven the first statement, if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race. However, the second statement tells us that Chris might not have finished the race. This means it's possible that Chris did not finish the race, which implies that Alex did not necessarily finish the race either. \n\nTherefore, combining the two statements, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
