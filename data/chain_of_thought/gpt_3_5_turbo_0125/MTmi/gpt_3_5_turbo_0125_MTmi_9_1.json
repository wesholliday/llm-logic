If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n2. Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can deduce that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This establishes a direct relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt.\n\nStatement 2 introduces uncertainty about whether Mark bought the blue shirt. This uncertainty does not provide definitive information on Mark's purchase, but it does not contradict the relationship stated in statement 1.\n\nGiven these statements, if we assume Lisa bought the red shirt and Mark did not buy the blue shirt (contrary to the relationship established in statement 1), it would violate the logic provided.
