This means that the presence of the bear in the cave implies the presence of the wolf in the den.\n\nFrom statement 2, we are told that the wolf might not have been in the den. This means that there is a possibility that the wolf was not in the den.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that if the wolf might not have been in the den, then the bear might not have been in the cave. This is because the presence of the bear in the cave implies the presence of the wolf in the den, but if the wolf was not in the den, then the bear might not have been in the cave.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
