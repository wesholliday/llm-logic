This statement is in the form of a conditional statement.\n\nHowever, the second statement tells us that Erin might not have taken a train. This means the possibility exists that Erin did not take a train, which would satisfy the condition \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\" Thus, there is a potential situation where both premises can logically coexist, and Sam can still have taken a plane even if Erin did not take a train.\n\nGiven this analysis, we cannot definitively conclude that Sam did not take a plane based on the provided information.\n\nAnswer: no",

This logical relationship indicates that if Sam took a plane, Erin's mode of transportation is fixed as a train.\n\nFrom the second statement: Erin might not have taken a train. This statement implies that Erin's mode of transportation is not definitively known.\n\nCombining these statements, there is a contradiction concerning Erin's transportation mode. The first statement mandates Erin taking a train if Sam takes a plane, while the second statement suggests that Erin might not have taken a train. This contradiction does not directly lead to the conclusion that Sam did not take a plane.
