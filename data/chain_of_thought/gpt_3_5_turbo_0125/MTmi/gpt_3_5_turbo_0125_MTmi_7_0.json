This does not provide direct information about Alex's completion of the race.\n\n2. \"Chris might not have finished the race\": This statement suggests that there is a possibility that Chris did not finish the race. This does not provide any information about Alex's completion of the race either.\n\nCombining the two statements, we have that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race, and there is a possibility that Chris did not finish the race. However, this does not definitively indicate whether Alex finished the race or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that Alex did not finish the race. \n\nAnswer: no",
