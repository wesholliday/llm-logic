If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\n2. The robot might not have visited Jupiter.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer the contrapositive: If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nGiven statement 2, which says the robot might not have visited Jupiter, we can conclude that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
