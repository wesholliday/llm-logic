This means that if Sue did choose pizza, Bob's choice is fixed to pasta.\n\nThe second statement says that Bob might not have chosen pasta, which means Bob's choice is not fixed to pasta.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that Sue did not choose pizza because if she did, Bob would have had to choose pasta according to the first statement. However, the second statement indicates that Bob's choice is not fixed to pasta, so Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
