The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\"\n2. The second statement is a possibility: \"The banana might not have been yellow.\"\n\nGiven these two statements, we can analyze them together:\n\n- If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. This means that if the apple was red, the banana had to be yellow.\n- The banana might not have been yellow. This statement introduces doubt about the banana being yellow.\n\nFrom the given statements, we cannot definitively conclude that the apple was not red. The possibility that the banana might not have been yellow does not directly negate the initial conditional statement about the apple being red. It only introduces doubt about the color of the banana, not the color of the apple.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The apple was not red' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
