This can be written as \"pants = denim\".\n\nIn order to deduce the statement \"The shirt was cotton\" from the given information, we need to check if both of the following conditions hold:\n1. The antecedent (if-part) of the conditional statement is true, and\n2. The consequent (then-part) of the conditional statement is true.\n\nThus, we need to check if it is true that:\n- Shirt = cotton (antecedent of the conditional statement) is true, and\n- Pants = denim (consequent of the conditional statement) is true.\n\nOnly if both conditions are true can we deduce that the shirt was cotton.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically deduce that the shirt was cotton.",
