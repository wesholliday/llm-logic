The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This statement does not provide any information about whether Tom actually watched football, only that if he did, then Jen watched basketball.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"Jen watched basketball.\" This statement directly tells us that Jen watched basketball.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot logically deduce that Tom watched football. The first statement only tells us what would happen if Tom watched football, but it does not confirm whether Tom actually watched football. The fact that Jen watched basketball does not provide any direct information about Tom's actions.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically deduce that Tom watched football.\n\nAnswer: no",
