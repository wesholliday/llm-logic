And we are given that the unicorn was in the forest. However, we cannot directly deduce that the griffin was in the forest based on this information alone. The statement \"If A then B\" does not necessarily mean \"If B then A.\"\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce that the griffin was in the forest based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
