Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nGiven these statements, we know that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. Since we also know that Lucy went to the zoo, it follows that Joe must have gone to the park based on the first statement.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can logically deduce that Joe went to the park.",
