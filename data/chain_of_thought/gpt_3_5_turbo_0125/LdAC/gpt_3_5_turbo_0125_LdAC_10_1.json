It means that whenever the dog is inside, the cat must be outside. \n2. \"The cat was outside\" provides a fact about the cat's location.\n\nBased on these statements, we can make the following deductions:\n- If the dog was inside (from the first statement), then the cat was outside (given in the first statement), which is consistent with the given information.\n- From the fact that the cat was outside (second statement), we know the second part of the conditional relationship (\"The cat was outside\") is true.\n\nBy putting these deductions together, we can logically deduce that the dog was inside, as we satisfy both parts of the conditional relationship provided in the first statement. \n\nTherefore, the logical deduction is: 'The dog was inside'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
