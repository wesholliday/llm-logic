Since the second statement tells us that Bob chose pasta, we can conclude that Sue must have chosen pizza. This is because the first statement establishes a conditional relationship between Sue choosing pizza and Bob choosing pasta, and the second statement confirms the consequent of that conditional relationship.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can logically deduce that Sue chose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
