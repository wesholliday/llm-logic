The statement does not provide any information about what happens if Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt. It is possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, and Mark still bought the blue shirt for some other reason.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce that Lisa bought the red shirt based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
