The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This statement does not provide direct information about whether Ben actually ate pasta, but it establishes a relationship between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating salad.\n\n2. The second statement is a direct statement: \"Kate ate salad.\" This statement provides direct information that Kate indeed ate salad.\n\nGiven these statements, we can analyze them together:\n\n- If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\n- Kate ate salad.\n\nFrom these statements alone, we cannot definitively conclude that Ben ate pasta. The first statement only establishes a relationship between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating salad, but it does not confirm that Ben actually ate pasta. The second statement confirms that Kate ate salad, but it does not provide direct information about Ben's actions.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot logically deduce that Ben ate pasta. \n\nAnswer: no",
