The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This statement does not provide direct information about Jeff playing basketball, but it establishes a relationship between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis.\n\n2. The second statement is a direct statement: \"Amy played tennis.\" This statement provides direct information about Amy playing tennis.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can analyze them together:\n\n- If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n- Amy played tennis.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. Since the second statement confirms that Amy played tennis, it satisfies the condition in the first statement. Therefore, we can logically deduce that Jeff played basketball based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
