If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n2. Sue was at the wedding.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can write the contrapositive as:\n- If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nSince statement 2 tells us that Sue was at the wedding, we can conclude that Mary was at the wedding based on the contrapositive of statement 1.\n\nTherefore, the logical deduction is: Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
