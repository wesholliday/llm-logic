The first statement is: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"The wolf was in the den.\"\n\nFrom these statements, we know that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. We also know that the wolf was indeed in the den. \n\nGiven these statements, we can logically deduce that the bear was in the cave. This is because if the bear was in the cave (based on the first statement), then the wolf would be in the den (first statement). Since we know the wolf was in the den (second statement), it follows that the bear must have been in the cave for the first statement to hold true.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can logically deduce that the bear was in the cave. \n\nAnswer: yes",
