However, this does not necessarily mean that the doll must be plastic if the truck is metal. The statement only provides a condition for the relationship between the doll and the truck.\n\nGiven that the second statement confirms that the truck was metal, it does not directly provide information about the material of the doll. The doll could still be plastic or another material.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically deduce that the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: no",
