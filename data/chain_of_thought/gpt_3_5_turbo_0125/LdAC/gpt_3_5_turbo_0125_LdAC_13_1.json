            "content": "To determine if we can logically deduce that the car was red, we can use modus tollens, a valid form of reasoning. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement \"if A then B\" and we know that B is false, then we can conclude that A is also false. \n\nGiven:\n1. If the car was red, then the truck was blue (if A then B).\n2. The truck was blue (B is true).\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can perform the following logical deduction:\n- Since B is true (the truck was blue), it means that \"the truck was blue\" matches the consequent of the conditional statement (\"the truck was blue\" matches B).\n- If we assume the condition in the conditional statement to be false (the car was red is false), then the consequent of the conditional statement (the truck was blue) would also be false, contradicting the given information that the truck was blue. \n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can deduce that the car was red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
