The first statement \"The grommet might not have been sploffed\" suggests that there is a possibility that the grommet was not sploffed. This does not necessarily mean that the grommet must have been sploffed. Therefore, we can infer the second statement \"It's not the case that the grommet must have been sploffed\" from the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
