The first statement \"The smonk might not have been vreebled\" suggests that there is a possibility that the smonk was not vreebled. If we negate this statement, it would mean that it is not necessarily the case that the smonk was not vreebled, leaving room for the possibility that it was vreebled. Therefore, we can infer the second statement \"It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled\" from the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
