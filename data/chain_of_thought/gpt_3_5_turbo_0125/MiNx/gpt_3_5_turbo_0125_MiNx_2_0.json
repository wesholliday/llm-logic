It does not definitively state whether the wug was or was not flooped.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement:\n\n\"It's not the case that the wug must have been flooped.\"\n\nThis statement negates the idea that the wug must have been flooped. It aligns with the original statement in that it allows for the possibility that the wug was not flooped.\n\nTherefore, based on the original statement, we can infer the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
