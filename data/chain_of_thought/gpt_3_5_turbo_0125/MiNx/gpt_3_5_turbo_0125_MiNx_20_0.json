The first statement \"The fleeg might not have been bluttered\" suggests that there is a possibility that the fleeg was not bluttered. When we negate this statement, we are saying that it is not necessarily the case that the fleeg was not bluttered. This does not necessarily mean that the fleeg must have been bluttered, as there could be other possibilities as well. Therefore, we cannot directly infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no",
