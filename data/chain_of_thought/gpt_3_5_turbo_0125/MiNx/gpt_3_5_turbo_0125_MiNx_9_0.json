This does not definitively state that the twonk was not plinked, only that there is a chance it was not.\n\nOn the other hand, \"It's not the case that the twonk must have been plinked\" directly states that it is not necessary for the twonk to have been plinked. This statement does not rule out the possibility that the twonk was plinked; it simply states that plinking is not a requirement.\n\nGiven these interpretations, we can infer that the statement \"It's not the case that the twonk must have been plinked\" can be inferred from \"The twonk might not have been plinked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
