The first statement \"The sprocket might not have been cranked\" suggests that there is a possibility that the sprocket was not cranked. This does not necessarily mean that it must not have been cranked. The second statement \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been cranked\" implies that it is not necessary for the sprocket to have been cranked. This aligns with the idea that there is a possibility that the sprocket was not cranked. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
