This means that crampling is not a certainty.\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the sneg must have been crampled\" implies that crampling is not a necessity or requirement for the sneg. This aligns with the original statement's suggestion that there is a possibility the sneg was not crampled.\n\nTherefore, based on the logic presented, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the sneg must have been crampled\" from \"The sneg might not have been crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
