It does not definitively state whether the flob was skizzled or not.\n\nNow, let's analyze the second statement:\n\nSecond statement: \"It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled.\"\n\nThis statement negates the idea that the flob must have been skizzled. It aligns with the original statement's implication that there is a possibility the flob was not skizzled.\n\nTherefore, based on the original statement and the second statement, we can infer that the second statement is a valid inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
