This sentence implies that there is a possibility that the zinger was not fraggled, but it does not definitively state that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nNow, let's look at the statement \"It's not the case that the zinger must have been fraggled\". This implies that it is not a necessity for the zinger to have been fraggled, which is consistent with the original statement. It does not definitively state that the zinger was not fraggled, but rather that it is not a requirement.\n\nGiven this analysis, yes, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the zinger must have been fraggled\" from the original statement \"The zinger might not have been fraggled\".",
