It does not definitively state that the flugel was not blimmed, only that there is a chance it was not.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement:\n\n\"It's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed.\"\n\nThis statement negates the idea that the flugel must have been blimmed. Since the original statement only suggests a possibility that the flugel was not blimmed, it aligns with the second statement that it is not a certainty that the flugel must have been blimmed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
