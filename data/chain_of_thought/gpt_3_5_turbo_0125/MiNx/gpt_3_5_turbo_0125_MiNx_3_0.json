The first statement \"The splat might not have been morphed\" suggests that there is a possibility that the splat was not morphed. This does not necessarily mean that it is certain that the splat was not morphed. \n\nThe second statement \"It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed\" is a stronger assertion. It implies that it is not necessary or obligatory for the splat to have been morphed. This statement goes beyond the first statement by denying a requirement for the splat to be morphed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot directly infer the second statement from the first because the first statement only suggests a possibility of the splat not being morphed, while the second statement makes a stronger claim about the necessity of the splat being morphed.",
