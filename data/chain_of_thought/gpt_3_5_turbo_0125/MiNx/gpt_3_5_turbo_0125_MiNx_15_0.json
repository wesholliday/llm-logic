These two statements are not equivalent. The original statement leaves room for uncertainty, while the second statement is a stronger assertion that it is not a requirement for the dreb to have been vroombed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot directly infer the second statement from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: no",
