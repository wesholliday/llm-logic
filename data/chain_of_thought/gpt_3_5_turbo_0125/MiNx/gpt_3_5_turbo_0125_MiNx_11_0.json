It leaves room for uncertainty.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed\" directly negates the idea that the flug had to be blummed. This statement implies that there is no necessity for the flug to have been blummed.\n\nGiven these considerations, we can infer the second statement from the first because the first statement allows for the possibility that the flug was not blummed, which aligns with the idea that it is not necessary for the flug to have been blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
