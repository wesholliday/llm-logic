It does not definitively state whether the wug was sproinged or not.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement:\n\n\"It's not the case that the wug must have been sproinged.\"\n\nThis statement negates the idea that the wug must have been sproinged, meaning it allows for the possibility that the wug was not sproinged.\n\nGiven that the original statement allows for the possibility that the wug was not sproinged, and the second statement also allows for this possibility, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
