The first statement \"The fribble might not have been snurgled\" suggests that there is a possibility that the fribble was not snurgled. This does not necessarily mean that the fribble must have been snurgled. The second statement \"It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled\" implies that it is not a requirement for the fribble to have been snurgled, which aligns with the first statement. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
