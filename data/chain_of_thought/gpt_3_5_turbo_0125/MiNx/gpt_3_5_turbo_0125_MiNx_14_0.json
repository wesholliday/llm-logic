This does not necessarily mean that the clug must not have been fleeked. It simply indicates uncertainty or doubt about whether the clug was fleeked.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the clug must have been fleeked\" directly negates the idea that the clug was definitely fleeked. It implies that it is not necessary for the clug to have been fleeked.\n\nGiven these considerations, we can infer that the statement \"It's not the case that the clug must have been fleeked\" can be logically derived from the original statement \"The clug might not have been fleeked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
