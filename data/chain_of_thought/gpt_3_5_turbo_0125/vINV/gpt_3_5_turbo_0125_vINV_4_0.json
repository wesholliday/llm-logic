The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the premise \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" can be rewritten as \"If not the robot visited Jupiter, then not the alien visited Mars.\"\n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive of the premise with the conclusion \"If the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter.\" We can see that they match in structure, as both have the form \"If not B, then not A.\" Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
