The contrapositive of the premise 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta' is 'If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza'. \n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive with the conclusion 'If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta'. We can see that they are logically equivalent statements. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
