The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the premise is \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry,\" which can be written as \"If A (cake is chocolate), then B (muffins are blueberry).\" \n\nThe conclusion is \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry,\" which can be written as \"If not A (cake is not chocolate), then not B (muffins are not blueberry).\" \n\nBy applying the contrapositive rule, we can see that the conclusion matches the contrapositive of the premise. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
