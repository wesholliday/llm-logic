            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze it using the rules of logical implication. \n\nThe premise states: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be represented as: A \u2192 B\n\nThe conclusion states: \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\" This can be represented as: \u00acA \u2192 \u00acB\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. In this case, the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
