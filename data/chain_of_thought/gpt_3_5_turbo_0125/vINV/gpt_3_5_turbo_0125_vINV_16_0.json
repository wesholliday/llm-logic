The contrapositive of the premise 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim' is 'If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton'. \n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive with the conclusion 'If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim'. If we substitute 'pants were not denim' for 'shirt was not cotton' in the contrapositive, we get 'If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton'. \n\nSince the contrapositive and the conclusion are the same, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
