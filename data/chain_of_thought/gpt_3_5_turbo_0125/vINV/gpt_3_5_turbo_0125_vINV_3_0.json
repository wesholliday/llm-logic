If the first premise is true and the second premise is true, then the conclusion logically follows. This is because the argument is structured in a way that if the condition in the first premise is met, then the consequent follows, and if the condition in the second premise is met, then the negation of the consequent follows.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
