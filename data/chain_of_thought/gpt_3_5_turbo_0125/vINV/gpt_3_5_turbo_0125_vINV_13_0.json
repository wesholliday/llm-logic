The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the premise \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" can be rewritten as \"If not blue truck, then not red car.\" \n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive of the premise with the conclusion \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\" If we rewrite the conclusion in contrapositive form, it becomes \"If not blue truck, then not red car.\" \n\nSince the contrapositive of the premise matches the conclusion, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
