The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the premise \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" can be rewritten as \"If not mummy was awake, then not vampire was awake.\" \n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive of the premise with the conclusion \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\" We can see that they match in structure, which means the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
