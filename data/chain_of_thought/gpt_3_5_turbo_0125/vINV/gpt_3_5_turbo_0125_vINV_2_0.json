In this case, the premise 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest' can be restated as 'If not unicorn in the forest, then not griffin in the forest'. \n\nNow, let's compare the conclusion 'If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest' with the contrapositive of the premise. If they match, then the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
