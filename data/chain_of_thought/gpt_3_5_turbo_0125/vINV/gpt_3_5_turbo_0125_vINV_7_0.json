Therefore, the contrapositive of the premise 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' is 'If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race'. \n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive of the premise with the conclusion 'If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race'. If the contrapositive of the premise matches the conclusion, then the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
