            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to consider the form of the argument. The argument given is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" The conclusion drawn is the contrapositive of the premise: \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\" \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the premise \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is true, then the conclusion \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball\" must also be true. This is because the contrapositive maintains the logical relationship between the two events.\n\nTherefore, the argument presented is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
