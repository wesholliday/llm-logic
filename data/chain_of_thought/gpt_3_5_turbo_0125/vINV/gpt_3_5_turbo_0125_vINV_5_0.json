            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to consider the form of the argument. The argument given is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" The conclusion drawn is the contrapositive of the premise: \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\" In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true. This form of argument is known as the law of contraposition.\n\nAnswer: yes",
