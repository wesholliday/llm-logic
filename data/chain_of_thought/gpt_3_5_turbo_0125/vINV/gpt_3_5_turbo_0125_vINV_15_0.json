The contrapositive of the premise 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' is 'If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane'. \n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive with the conclusion 'If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train'. We can see that they are equivalent statements. If one statement is true, then the other is also true, and if one is false, then the other is false. \n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
