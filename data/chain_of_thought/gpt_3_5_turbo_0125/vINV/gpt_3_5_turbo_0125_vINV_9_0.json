The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the premise is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt,\" which can be written as \"If Lisa -> Mark.\" \n\nThe conclusion is \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt,\" which can be written as \"If not Lisa -> not Mark.\" \n\nBy applying the contrapositive rule, we can see that the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
