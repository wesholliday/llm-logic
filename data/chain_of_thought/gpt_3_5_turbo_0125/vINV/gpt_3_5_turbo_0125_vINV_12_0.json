            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze it using the contrapositive rule. The contrapositive of the premise 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' is 'If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park'. \n\nIf the contrapositive is true, then the original argument is logically valid. This is because the contrapositive rule states that if a conditional statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, if the contrapositive 'If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park' is true, then the original argument 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' implies 'If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo', making the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
