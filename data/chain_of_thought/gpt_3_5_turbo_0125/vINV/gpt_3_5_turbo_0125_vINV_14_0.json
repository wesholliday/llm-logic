The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the premise is \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den,\" which can be written as \"If bear \u2192 cave, then wolf \u2192 den.\" \n\nThe conclusion is \"If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den,\" which can be written as \"If not bear \u2192 not cave, then not wolf \u2192 not den.\"\n\nTo check if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion matches the contrapositive of the premise. \n\n1. Premise: If bear \u2192 cave, then wolf \u2192 den\n2. Contrapositive of the premise: If not den \u2192 not wolf, then not cave \u2192 not bear\n3. Conclusion: If not bear \u2192 not cave, then not wolf \u2192 not den\n\nSince the conclusion matches the contrapositive of the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
