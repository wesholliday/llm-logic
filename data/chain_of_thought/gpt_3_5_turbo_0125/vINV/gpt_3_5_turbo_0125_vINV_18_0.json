In this case, the premise 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' can be restated as 'If not metal, then not plastic'. \n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive of the premise with the conclusion 'If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal'. If they match, then the argument is logically valid. \n\nContrapositive of the premise: If not metal, then not plastic\nConclusion: If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal\n\nSince the contrapositive of the premise matches the conclusion, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
