This means that the fribble cannot be crinked.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the fribble is either crinked or snurgled. Since we know the fribble is not crinked, it must be snurgled according to statement 2.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The fribble is snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
