            "content": "Explanation: In the original statement, it is specified that the flonk must be both frazzle and quank by quimble. This means that the flonk must possess both qualities, frazzle and quank, and these qualities must be achieved by quimble. If we remove the word \"frazzle\" from the statement, we are left with \"The flonk must be quank by quimble.\" This new statement does not specify that the flonk must also be frazzle. Therefore, we cannot infer that the flonk must be quank by quimble based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
