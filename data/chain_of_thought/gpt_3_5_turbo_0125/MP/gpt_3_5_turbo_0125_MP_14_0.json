The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\" This can be represented as: Bear \u2192 Wolf.\n\n2. The second statement is a fact: \"The bear was in the cave.\" This can be represented as: Bear.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can conclude that if the bear was in the cave (Bear), then the wolf was in the den (Wolf). Since we know that the bear was in the cave, we can infer that the wolf was in the den based on the conditional relationship provided in the first statement.\n\nTherefore, the inference 'The wolf was in the den' can be made from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
