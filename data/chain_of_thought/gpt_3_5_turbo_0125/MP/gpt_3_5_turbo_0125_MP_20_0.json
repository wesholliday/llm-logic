The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n2. The second statement is a premise: \"The apple was red.\"\n\nGiven that the apple was red, according to the conditional statement, if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. Since the premise confirms that the apple was indeed red, we can conclude that the condition of the conditional statement is satisfied. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the banana was yellow.\n\nAnswer: yes",
