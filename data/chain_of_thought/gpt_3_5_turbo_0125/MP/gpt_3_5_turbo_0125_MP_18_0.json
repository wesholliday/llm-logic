            "content": "To determine if we can infer that the truck was metal, we need to consider the given statements logically. \n\n1. \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" - This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\". It means that if the doll is plastic (P), then the truck is metal (Q).\n\n2. \"The doll was plastic\" - This is a statement that tells us the doll is plastic.\n\nGiven these statements, we can infer that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. Since we are given that the doll is plastic, we can conclude that the truck must be metal based on the first statement. \n\nTherefore, the inference that can be made is: \"The truck was metal.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
