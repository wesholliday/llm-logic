            "content": "To determine if we can infer that Mark bought the blue shirt, we need to consider the logical relationship between the statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" The second statement is a premise: \"Lisa bought the red shirt.\"\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that if the conditional statement is true and the antecedent (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the consequent (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true. This is based on the logical structure of a conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
