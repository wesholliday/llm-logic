            "content": "To determine if we can infer that the mummy was awake, we need to consider the logical relationship between the statements provided. \n\n1. \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" - This is a conditional statement where the waking of the mummy is dependent on the waking of the vampire. If the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake.\n\n2. \"The vampire was awake\" - This statement tells us that the vampire is indeed awake.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can conclude that if the vampire is awake (as stated in the second statement), then according to the first statement, the mummy must also be awake. Therefore, we can infer that the mummy was awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
