The remote control is either on the coffee table or hiding under the couch.\n2. The remote control isn't hiding under the couch.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that the remote control cannot be hiding under the couch. Since the remote control must be in one of the two places mentioned, and it is not under the couch, it must be on the coffee table. Therefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
