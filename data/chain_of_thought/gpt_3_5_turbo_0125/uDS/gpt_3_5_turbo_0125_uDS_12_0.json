The jacket is either draped over the chair or hanging in the closet.\n2. The jacket isn't hanging in the closet.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that the jacket cannot be hanging in the closet. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the jacket is draped over the chair. This is because the statement \"the jacket is either draped over the chair or hanging in the closet\" implies that one of these two options must be true. Since hanging in the closet is ruled out, the only possibility left is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
