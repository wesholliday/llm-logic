The notebook isn't on the nightstand.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can conclude that the notebook must be in the drawer because it cannot be on the nightstand. This is because the first statement tells us that the notebook is in one of two places, and the second statement rules out one of those places (the nightstand). Therefore, the notebook must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
