The statement says that either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch. This means it must be in one of those two places.\n\n2. The statement also says that the remote control isn't hiding under the couch. This rules out the possibility of the remote control being under the couch.\n\n3. Since the remote control isn't under the couch, the only remaining place for it to be is on the coffee table, based on the first statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
