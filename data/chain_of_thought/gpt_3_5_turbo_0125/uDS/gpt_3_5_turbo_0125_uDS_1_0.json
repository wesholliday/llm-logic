Fido is not in the garden.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that Fido must be either inside or in the garden. Since the second statement tells us that Fido is not in the garden, it follows that Fido must be inside. This is because if Fido is not in the garden, the only remaining option from the first statement is that Fido is inside.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
