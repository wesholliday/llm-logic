The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can reason as follows:\n- If the keys are not dangling in the cabinet (from statement 2), then they must be in the drawer (from statement 1).\n- This is because the first statement tells us that the keys are either in the drawer or dangling in the cabinet, and since they are not dangling in the cabinet, they must be in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
