The sunglasses are not perched on her head.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can conclude that if the sunglasses are not perched on her head, then they must be in her bag. This is because the first statement tells us that the sunglasses must be in one of the two locations, and the second statement rules out one of the locations (perched on her head). Therefore, the only remaining option is that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
