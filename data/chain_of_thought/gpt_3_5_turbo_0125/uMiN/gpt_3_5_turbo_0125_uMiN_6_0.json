This does not necessarily mean that she must have chosen pizza. The statement \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" leaves room for other possibilities besides Sue choosing pizza.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that it's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza based on the statement that Sue might not have chosen pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
