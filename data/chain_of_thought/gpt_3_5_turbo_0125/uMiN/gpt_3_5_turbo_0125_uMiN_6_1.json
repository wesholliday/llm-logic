To determine if we can infer that it's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza, we need to consider if the possibility of Sue choosing something other than pizza means that she did not choose pizza for certain.\n\nIf Sue might not have chosen pizza, it indicates that there are other options available to her. However, this does not definitively exclude the possibility that she still chose pizza despite the availability of other choices. \n\nIn other words, just because there are alternative possibilities doesn't necessarily mean that she did not choose pizza. It is possible that she still chose pizza among the available options, even if she might not have. \n\nTherefore, we cannot confidently infer that it's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza based solely on the fact that she might not have chosen pizza.\n\nAnswer: no",
