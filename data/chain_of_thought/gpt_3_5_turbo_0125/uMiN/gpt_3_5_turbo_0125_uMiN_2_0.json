On the other hand, to say that it's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest means that it is not a certainty that the griffin was in the forest. These two statements are not the same. It is possible for the griffin to not have been in the forest without it being a certainty that it must have been in the forest.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that it's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest based solely on the statement that the griffin might not have been in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no",
