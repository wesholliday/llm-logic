In this situation, if we know that the notebook might not be in the drawer, it means there is a possibility that it is not there. However, this does not definitively prove that the notebook must not be in the drawer. It is still possible that the notebook is in the drawer despite the uncertainty. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that it's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: no",
