If the package has shipped, then it will arrive today. (Package Shipped \u2192 Package Arrives Today)\n2. If the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today. (Package Shipped \u2227 Misrouted \u2192 Package Arrives Today)\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if the package has shipped, it will arrive today. However, the second statement introduces the additional condition of the package being misrouted. \n\nIf the package is misrouted, it may not necessarily arrive today because misrouting can cause delays in delivery. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that if the package has shipped and was misrouted, it will arrive today based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
