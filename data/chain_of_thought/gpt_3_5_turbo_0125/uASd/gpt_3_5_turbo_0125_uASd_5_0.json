If the bill is paid, then the services will continue.\n\nIn the new scenario:\n2. The bill is paid and the check bounces.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the bill is paid, then the services will continue. However, the new scenario introduces the additional information that the check bounces. This means that even though the bill was paid, the payment method (check) was not successful.\n\nSince the original statement did not specify anything about the payment method or the consequences of a bounced check, we cannot directly infer that if the bill is paid and the check bounces, then the services will continue. The bounced check introduces uncertainty and potential complications that were not addressed in the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the bill is paid and the check bounces, then the services will continue.\n\nAnswer: no",
