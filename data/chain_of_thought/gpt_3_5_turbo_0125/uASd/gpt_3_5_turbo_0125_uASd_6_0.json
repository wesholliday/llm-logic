However, if the act of screaming itself causes pain to your ears regardless of the intensity of the sound, then wearing earplugs may not fully prevent the pain.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively infer that if you scream and the listener is wearing earplugs, it will not hurt their ears.",
