Getting enough sleep typically helps in reducing tiredness because it allows the body to rest and recover from daily activities.\n2. Doing hard labor can be physically demanding and lead to tiredness, regardless of how much sleep one has had.\n\nConsidering these points, even if someone gets enough sleep, doing hard physical labor can still result in tiredness due to the physical strain it puts on the body.
