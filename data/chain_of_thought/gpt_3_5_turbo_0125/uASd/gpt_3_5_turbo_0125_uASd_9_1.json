In this scenario, the original statement suggests that a well-written essay will result in an A grade. However, there is no information provided about how lateness of submission affects the grading process. The fact that an essay is well-written does not necessarily guarantee a specific grade if it is turned in late. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that a well-written, late essay will result in an A grade based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",

This combination can be symbolically represented as \"Essay is well-written and turned in late \u2192 Student gets A.\"\n\nTo show that the new statement is true based on the given conditional statement, we need to consider two scenarios. The first scenario is when the essay is well-written and turned in on time. In this case, the student will get an A based on the given information.\n\nThe second scenario is when the essay is well-written and turned in late. This scenario is not directly covered by the original conditional statement, as it only addresses the case when the essay is well-written and not the timing of its submission.\n\nTherefore, without additional information or another premise that explicitly states the consequence for turning in the essay late, we cannot directly infer that if the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A.\n\nAnswer: no",

If the essay meets the criteria of being well-written, then the student is guaranteed to receive an A.\n\n2. \"The essay is well-written and turned in late\":\n   This part introduces a new condition - the essay is turned in late. This additional factor was not mentioned in the initial statement that directly linked the quality of the essay to the grade.\n\nGiven that turning in an essay late is typically associated with grade deductions or penalties in academic settings, combining the quality of the essay with the lateness of submission may not lead to the automatic conclusion of receiving an A. The original relationship established in the first statement may not hold true when late submission is taken into account.\n\nTherefore, based on the premises provided, we cannot infer that if the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A. \n\nAnswer: no",
