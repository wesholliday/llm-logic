Exercise can help burn calories and improve overall health, which can contribute to weight loss. However, eating junk food, which is typically high in calories, sugar, and unhealthy fats, can counteract the benefits of exercise and lead to weight gain. Therefore, it is not safe to infer that exercising and eating junk food will result in weight loss.",
