The original statement \"If we go to the concert, then we'll have a good time\" is a conditional statement. It indicates that going to the concert will lead to having a good time. However, introducing the unrelated event of a bomb going off changes the situation significantly as it introduces a dangerous and negative element that was not part of the original context.\n\nGiven that the original statement does not account for the presence of a bomb going off, we cannot logically infer that having a bomb go off at the concert would lead to us having a good time, as that would be illogical and inappropriate given the dangerous and harmful nature of such an event.\n\nAnswer: No",
