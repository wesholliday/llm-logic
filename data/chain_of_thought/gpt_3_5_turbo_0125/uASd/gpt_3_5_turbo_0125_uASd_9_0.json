The original statement says that if the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A. However, the new scenario introduces a new condition - the essay is well-written and turned in late. \n\nIn the new scenario, we are not explicitly told how turning in the essay late affects the grade. The original statement only mentions the quality of the essay (well-written) as a factor in determining the grade. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that if the essay is well-written and turned in late, the student will get an A based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
