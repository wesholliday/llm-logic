Fertilizing the lawn provides essential nutrients for the grass to grow, leading to a lush and green appearance.

During a drought, the lack of water can stress the grass and cause it to turn brown and dry.\n\nTherefore, even if you fertilize the lawn, the impact of a drought can override the positive effects of fertilization, and the lawn may not be lush and green.",
