M \u2192 Q: If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked.\n\nFrom these statements, we can see that if the splat was morphed (M), then it must have quanked (Q). However, we are given that it's not the case that the splat must have quanked (\u00acQ). This means that the splat was not morphed (\u00acM), because if it were morphed, it would have quanked according to the second statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
