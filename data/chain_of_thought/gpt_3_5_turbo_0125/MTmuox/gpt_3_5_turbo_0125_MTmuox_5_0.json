This is because if it was fraggled, it must have been smoogled according to statement 2. Since it is not necessary for the zinger to have been smoogled according to statement 1, we can infer that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The zinger was not fraggled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
