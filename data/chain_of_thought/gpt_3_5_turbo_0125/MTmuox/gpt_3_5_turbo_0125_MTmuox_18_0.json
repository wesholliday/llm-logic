P \u2192 N (If the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged)\n\nFrom the premises, we can infer that if the shank was plooked (P), then it must have been nugged (N). However, we cannot directly infer that the shank was not plooked (~P) from the given premises. The premises do not provide information about whether the shank was plooked or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The shank was not plooked' from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
