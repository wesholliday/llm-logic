We want to infer \"The grommet was not sploffed\", which can be represented as \u00acS.\n\n4. To infer \u00acS, we need to show that S \u2192 \u00acS is a valid deduction based on the given statements.\n\n5. By the law of contraposition, S \u2192 \u00acS is equivalent to \u00ac\u00acS \u2192 \u00acS, which simplifies to S \u2192 \u00acS.\n\n6. From the given statements, we have S \u2192 (G \u2192 F) and \u00ac(G \u2192 F).\n\n7. If we assume S (the grommet was sploffed), then from S \u2192 (G \u2192 F), we can infer G \u2192 F.\n\n8. However, we also know \u00ac(G \u2192 F), which contradicts G \u2192 F.\n\n9. Since there is a contradiction when assuming S, we can conclude that S (the grommet was sploffed) is false.\n\n10. Therefore, we can infer \"The grommet was not sploffed\" (\u00acS) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
