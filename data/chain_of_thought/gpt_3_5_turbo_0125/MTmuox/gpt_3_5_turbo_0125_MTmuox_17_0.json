This means if the flob did not have to movate, then the flob was not skizzled.\n\n- However, we cannot directly infer \u00acS (the flob was not skizzled) from the given statements because we do not have information about whether the flob had to movate or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer \"The flob was not skizzled\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
