To do this, we can use proof by contradiction:\n\nAssume B (the flug was blummed).\nFrom statement 2 (B \u2192 Z), if B is true, then Z must also be true.\nBut from statement 1 (~Z), we know that Z is false.\nThis leads to a contradiction, as we assumed B to be true but arrived at a contradiction.\nTherefore, our assumption that B is true must be false, meaning ~B is true.\n\nSo, yes, we can infer \"The flug was not blummed\" from the given statements.",
