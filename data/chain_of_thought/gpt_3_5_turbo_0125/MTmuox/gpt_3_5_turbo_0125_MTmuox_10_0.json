If we assume that the wug was sproinged (sproinged), then according to the second statement, it must have been garpled (garpled). However, the first statement tells us that it's not the case that the wug must have been garpled (\u00acgarpled). This leads to a contradiction because if the wug was sproinged, it must have been garpled, but it's not the case that it must have been garpled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the wug was not sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
