To do this, we can use the contrapositive of the second statement:\n\n- The contrapositive of S \u2192 L is ~L \u2192 ~S.\n\nSince we already have ~L from the first statement, we can conclude ~S from the contrapositive.\n\nTherefore, the inference \"The smip was not shripped\" can be made from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
