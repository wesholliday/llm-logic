We want to determine if we can infer ~S (the glip was not slogged) from these statements.\n\nTo do this, we can use the contrapositive of the second statement:\n- The contrapositive of S -> T is ~T -> ~S, which means if the glip did not trag, then the glip was not slogged.\n\nGiven ~T and the contrapositive of S -> T, we can indeed infer that the glip was not slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
