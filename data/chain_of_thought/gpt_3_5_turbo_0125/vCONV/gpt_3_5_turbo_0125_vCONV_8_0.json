The contrapositive of the premise 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' is 'If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake'. \n\nIf we assume the contrapositive is true, then the conclusion 'If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake' logically follows. This is because if the mummy was not awake (contrapositive), then the vampire was not awake, which means if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
