The given argument is a conditional statement: \"If A, then B\" from the premise and \"If B, then A\" as the conclusion. This seems to represent a form of the logical principle known as converse.\n\nIn logic, the converse of a conditional statement (\"If A, then B\") is formed by switching the hypothesis and conclusion. For example, the converse of \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" would be \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race\".\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the validity of an argument is determined not by the specific content of the statements but by the form of the argument itself. So, we need to consider whether the given argument is valid based on the structure of the conditional statements used.\n\nIf you analyze the structure of the conditional statements in the original argument, it appears to be invalid. Switching the hypothesis and conclusion in the given premise does not necessarily lead to the provided conclusion. The argument seems to be committing a logical fallacy by incorrectly assuming that the converse of a conditional statement must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid based on the given information.",
