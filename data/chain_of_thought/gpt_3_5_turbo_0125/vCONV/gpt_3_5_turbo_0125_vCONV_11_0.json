The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the premise \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" can be rewritten as \"If not blueberry muffins, then not chocolate cake.\" \n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive of the premise with the conclusion \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate.\" If we rewrite the conclusion using the contrapositive rule, it becomes \"If not chocolate cake, then not blueberry muffins.\"\n\nBy comparing the contrapositive of the premise with the conclusion, we see that they are not equivalent. The contrapositive of the premise does not lead to the conclusion. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: no",
