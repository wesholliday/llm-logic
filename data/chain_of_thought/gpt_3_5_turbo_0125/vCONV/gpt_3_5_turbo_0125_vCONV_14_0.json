            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to consider the form of the argument. The argument is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If A, then B.\" The premise states \"If the bear was in the case, then the wolf was in the den,\" which can be represented as \"Bear \u2192 Wolf.\" The conclusion states \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case,\" which can be represented as \"Wolf \u2192 Bear.\"\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In this case, the argument is valid because the conclusion \"Wolf \u2192 Bear\" is the contrapositive of the premise \"Bear \u2192 Wolf.\" According to the rules of logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
