The contrapositive of the premise 'If A then B' is 'If not B then not A'. \n\nGiven:\nPremise: If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. (A -> B)\n\nConclusion: If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race. (B -> A)\n\nNow, let's apply the contrapositive rule:\nContrapositive of the premise: If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race. (not B -> not A)\n\nComparing the contrapositive of the premise with the conclusion, we see that they are not equivalent. The conclusion should have been 'If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race' for the argument to be logically valid.\n\nTherefore, the argument in its current form is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
