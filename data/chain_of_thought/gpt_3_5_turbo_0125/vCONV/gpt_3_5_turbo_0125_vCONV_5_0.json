            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to consider the form of the argument. The argument is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If P then Q.\" The premise states \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis,\" which can be represented as \"If Jeff played basketball (P), then Amy played tennis (Q).\" The conclusion states \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball,\" which can be represented as \"If Amy played tennis (Q), then Jeff played basketball (P).\"\n\nIn this case, the argument is valid because it follows the logical form of a contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P then Q\" is \"If not Q then not P.\" In this argument, the premise and conclusion are contrapositives of each other, which means that if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
