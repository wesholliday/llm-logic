The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" \n\nIn this case, the premise \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" can be rewritten as \"If not Lucy went to the zoo, then not Joe went to the park.\" \n\nComparing the contrapositive of the premise with the conclusion \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park,\" we see that they match. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
