Conclusion: \"If the truck was blue, then the car was red.\"\n\nIn this argument, the premise establishes a conditional relationship between the colors of the car and the truck. It states that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. This is represented as: \"car (red) \u2192 truck (blue).\"\n\nThe conclusion reverses this conditional relationship, asserting that if the truck was blue, then the car was red. This is represented as: \"truck (blue) \u2192 car (red).\"\n\nGiven that the premise sets up the relationship in one direction (car \u2192 truck), and the conclusion asserts the relationship in the opposite direction (truck \u2192 car), this argument employs a valid form of reasoning called 'contraposition.' Contraposition involves switching the hypothesis and conclusion of a conditional statement while negating both.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
