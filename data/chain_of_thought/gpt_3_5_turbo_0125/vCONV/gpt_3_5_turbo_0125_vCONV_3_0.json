If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n2. If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James.\n\nBy looking at the form of the argument, we can see that it follows the pattern of a valid hypothetical syllogism. If the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true. This is because the argument is structured in a way that if the first condition is met, then the second condition must also be met. \n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
