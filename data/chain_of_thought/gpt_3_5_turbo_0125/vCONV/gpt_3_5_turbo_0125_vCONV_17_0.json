The argument is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If A, then B.\" In this case, the premise is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad,\" and the conclusion is \"If Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta.\"\n\nIn a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid if the contrapositive of the premise matches the conclusion. In this case, the contrapositive of the premise \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" is \"If Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n\nIf the conclusion is equivalent to the contrapositive of the premise, then the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
