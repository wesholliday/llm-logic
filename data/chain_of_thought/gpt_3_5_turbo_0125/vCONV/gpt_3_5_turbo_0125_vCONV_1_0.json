            "content": "To determine the validity of this argument, we can analyze it using the contrapositive rule. The contrapositive of the premise 'If A then B' is 'If not B then not A'. Therefore, the contrapositive of 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is 'If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding'. \n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive of the premise with the conclusion 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding'. We can see that they are not the same. The contrapositive of the premise does not lead to the conclusion. \n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: no",
