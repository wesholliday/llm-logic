The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the premise \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" can be rewritten as \"If not yellow, then not red.\" \n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\" This can be rewritten as \"If not red, then not yellow.\"\n\nComparing the contrapositive of the premise and the conclusion, we see that they do not match. The contrapositive of the premise is \"If not yellow, then not red,\" while the conclusion is \"If not red, then not yellow.\" Since they are not equivalent, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
