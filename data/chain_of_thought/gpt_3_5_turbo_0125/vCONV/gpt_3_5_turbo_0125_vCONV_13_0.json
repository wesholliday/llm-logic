The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" \n\nIn this case, the premise \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" can be rewritten as \"If not blue truck, then not red car.\" This is the contrapositive form of the premise.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion \"If the truck was blue, then the car was red.\" This can be rewritten as \"If not red car, then not blue truck.\" This is the contrapositive form of the conclusion.\n\nSince the contrapositive of the premise matches the contrapositive of the conclusion, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
