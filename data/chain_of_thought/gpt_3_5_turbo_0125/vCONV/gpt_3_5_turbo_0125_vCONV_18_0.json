The contrapositive of the premise 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' is 'If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic'. \n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive with the conclusion 'If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic'. If we substitute 'not metal' for 'metal' in the contrapositive, we get 'If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic', which is the opposite of the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the contrapositive of the premise does not lead to the conclusion. \n\nAnswer: no",
