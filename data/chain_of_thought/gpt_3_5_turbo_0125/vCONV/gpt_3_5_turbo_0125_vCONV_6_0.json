The contrapositive of the premise 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta' is 'If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza'. If the contrapositive of the premise leads to the conclusion 'If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza', then the argument is logically valid.\n\nLet's check if the contrapositive of the premise leads to the conclusion:\n\nContrapositive of the premise: If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nConclusion: If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza.\n\nSince the contrapositive of the premise leads to the conclusion, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
