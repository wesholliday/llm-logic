The argument given is an example of the contrapositive form, which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. \n\nIn propositional logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \"if p, then q\" is \"if not q, then not p\". In other words, if the original statement is true, the contrapositive statement is also true.\n\nIn this case, the premise \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" can be represented as \"if Mary, then Sue\". The conclusion \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\" can be represented as \"if Sue, then Mary\". These statements are contrapositives of each other.\n\nTherefore, the argument presented is logically valid due to the nature of contrapositive reasoning.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
