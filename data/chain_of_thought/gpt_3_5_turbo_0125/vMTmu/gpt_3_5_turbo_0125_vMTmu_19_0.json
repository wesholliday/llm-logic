Let's represent the first premise as: \n   P: Tom watched football\n   Q: Jen watched basketball\n   The first premise can be written as: If P, then Q (P -> Q)\n\n2. The second premise is the negation of the consequent of the first premise:\n   \u00acQ: It's not the case that Jen watched basketball\n\n3. The conclusion is the negation of the antecedent of the first premise:\n   \u00acP: Tom did not watch football\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n- If Tom watched football (P), then Jen must have watched basketball (Q).\n- It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball (\u00acQ).\n- Therefore, Tom did not watch football (\u00acP).\n\nBy using modus tollens (If P -> Q and \u00acQ, then \u00acP), the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
