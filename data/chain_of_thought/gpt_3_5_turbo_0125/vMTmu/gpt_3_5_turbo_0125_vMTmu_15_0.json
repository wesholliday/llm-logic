Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, then we can conclude that A is also false. \n\nIn this case:\n- Premise 1: If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train (If A, then B)\n- Premise 2: It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train (Not B)\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer:\n- Conclusion: Sam did not take a plane (Not A)\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
