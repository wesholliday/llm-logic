The first premise states: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" This can be represented as: \n   - If D (doll is plastic), then T (truck is metal).\n\n2. The second premise states: \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\" This can be represented as: \n   - Not T (truck is not metal).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The doll was not plastic.\" This can be represented as: \n   - Not D (doll is not plastic).\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n- If the doll was plastic (D), then the truck must have been metal (T).\n- It's not the case that the truck must have been metal (Not T).\n- Therefore, the doll was not plastic (Not D).\n\nBased on the premises and the conclusion, we can see that the argument is logically valid. The conclusion logically follows from the premises using the rules of logical implication. \n\nAnswer: yes",
