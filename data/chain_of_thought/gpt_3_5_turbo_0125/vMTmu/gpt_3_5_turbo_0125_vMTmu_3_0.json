Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, then we can conclude that A is false as well.\n\nIn this case:\n- Premise 1: If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel (If A, then B)\n- Premise 2: It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel (Not B)\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer:\n- Conclusion: The book was not written by James (Not A)\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
