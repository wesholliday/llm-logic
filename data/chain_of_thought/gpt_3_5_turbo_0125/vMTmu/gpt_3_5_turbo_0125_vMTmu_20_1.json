            "content": "To determine the logical validity of the argument, we can analyze it using the method of contraposition. The first premise can be rewritten as 'If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red' by taking the contrapositive. The second premise directly states that 'It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow', which aligns with the contrapositive of the first premise. Finally, combining the contrapositive of the first premise with the second premise allows us to logically deduce that 'The apple was not red'. This means the conclusion follows logically from the premises, making the argument valid.\n\nTherefore, the form of argument presented is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
