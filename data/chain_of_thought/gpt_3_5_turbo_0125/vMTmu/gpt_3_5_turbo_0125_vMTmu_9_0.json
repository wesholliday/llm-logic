The argument is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where A is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and B is \"Mark must have bought the blue shirt\". The second premise states the negation of B, which is \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt\".\n\nGiven the first premise \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" and the second premise \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt\", we cannot definitively conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. The absence of Mark buying the blue shirt does not necessarily mean Lisa did not buy the red shirt. There could be other reasons why Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.",
