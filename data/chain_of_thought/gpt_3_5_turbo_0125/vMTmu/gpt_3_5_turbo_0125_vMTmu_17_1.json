Premise 1: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\" This is a conditional statement, also known as a material implication.\n2. Premise 2: \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad.\" This means Kate did not eat salad, which can be symbolized as -K (not Kate).\n3. Conclusion: \"Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n\nWe can break down premise 1 into symbolic form as: B -> K (Ben ate pasta implies Kate ate salad), and premise 2 as: -K (Kate did not eat salad). Now, if Ben did eat pasta (B), then Kate must have eaten salad (K). But since it's given that Kate did not eat salad (-K), the conclusion that Ben did not eat pasta (negation of B) logically follows if the premises are true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
