(Premise)\n2. It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. (Premise)\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer the contrapositive: If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding. This is based on the logical equivalence of a conditional statement and its contrapositive.\n\nGiven premise 2, which states that Sue must not have been at the wedding, we can conclude that Mary was not at the wedding based on the contrapositive of premise 1.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
