If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter. (Premise)\n2. It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter. (Premise)\n\nFrom premise 1, we have the implication: If A (alien visited Mars), then B (robot visited Jupiter). This can be represented as A -> B.\n\nFrom premise 2, we have the negation of B: ~B (not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter).\n\nNow, if we assume the negation of the conclusion (The alien did visit Mars), we get ~A. \n\nIf we combine the premises and the negation of the conclusion, we get:\nA -> B\n~B\nTherefore, ~A\n\nThis is a valid form of argument known as Modus Tollens, which states that if A implies B and B is false, then A must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
