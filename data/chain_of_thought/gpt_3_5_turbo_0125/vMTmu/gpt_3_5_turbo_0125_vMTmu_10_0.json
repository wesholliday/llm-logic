The first premise states: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\" This can be represented as: If D, then C.\n\n2. The second premise states: \"It's not the case that the cat must have been outside.\" This can be represented as: Not C.\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The dog was not inside.\" This can be represented as: Not D.\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\n1. If D, then C\n2. Not C\n3. Not D\n\nBy using the rules of logical reasoning, we can see that the argument is logically valid. This is because if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true based on the given premises.",
