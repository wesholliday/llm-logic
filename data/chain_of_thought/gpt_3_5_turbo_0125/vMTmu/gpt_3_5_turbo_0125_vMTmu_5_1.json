The first premise is in the form: If A, then B. The second premise denies the consequent, stating \"It's not the case that B.\" From these premises, the conclusion is drawn asserting the denial of the antecedent, therefore concluding that \"It's not the case that A\" or, more explicitly, \"Jeff did not play basketball.\"\n\nThis form of argument is known as denying the antecedent, which is a logical fallacy. Denying the antecedent asserts that since the consequent is false, the antecedent must also be false. However, this is not necessarily true. Just because Amy did not play tennis (B is false) does not mean that Jeff did not play basketball (A is false) as there may be other reasons why Amy did not play tennis.\n\nIn summary, the argument is not logically valid based on the form of denying the antecedent, which is a fallacious argument form.\n\nAnswer: no",
