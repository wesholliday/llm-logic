The argument is a conditional statement in the form of \"If A, then B.\" The first premise states \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\" This can be represented as: \n\n1. If V, then M\n\nThe second premise states \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\" This can be represented as the negation of the consequent in the first premise:\n\n2. \u00acM\n\nNow, we can use modus tollens, a valid form of argument, to see if the conclusion logically follows:\n\n1. If V, then M\n2. \u00acM\nTherefore, \u00acV\n\nBy applying modus tollens, we can see that the conclusion \"The vampire was not awake\" logically follows from the premises. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
