Let's represent the first premise as: If P, then Q (If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest).\n2. The second premise is: Not Q (It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest).\n3. The conclusion is: Not P (The griffin was not in the forest).\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Not Q\n3. Therefore, Not P\n\nThis argument follows the valid form of Modus Tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know \"Not Q\", then we can logically conclude \"Not P\". Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
