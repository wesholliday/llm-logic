If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race. (Premise)\n2. It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race. (Premise)\n\nFrom premise 1, we have the implication: Alex finished the race -> Chris finished the race.\n\nFrom premise 2, we have the negation: ~Chris finished the race.\n\nIf we combine the implication and the negation, we get: Alex finished the race -> ~Chris finished the race.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion 'Alex did not finish the race' logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
