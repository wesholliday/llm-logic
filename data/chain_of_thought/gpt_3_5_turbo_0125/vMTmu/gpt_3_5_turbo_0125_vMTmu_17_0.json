The first premise states: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\" This can be represented as: B \u2192 K.\n2. The second premise states: \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad.\" This can be represented as: \u00acK.\n3. The conclusion is: \"Ben did not eat pasta.\" This can be represented as: \u00acB.\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\n1. B \u2192 K (If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad)\n2. \u00acK (It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad)\n3. \u00acB (Ben did not eat pasta)\n\nFrom the premises, we can see that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad. However, the second premise states that Kate did not eat salad. Therefore, we can conclude that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
