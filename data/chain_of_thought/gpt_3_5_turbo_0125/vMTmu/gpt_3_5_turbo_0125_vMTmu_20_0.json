It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow. (Premise)\n\nFrom the first premise, we can infer the contrapositive: If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red. This is a valid logical inference based on the contrapositive rule.\n\nGiven that the second premise states that it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow, we can conclude that the banana was not yellow. Therefore, by the contrapositive inference, we can conclude that the apple was not red.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
