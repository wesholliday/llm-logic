It's not the case that the truck must have been blue. (Premise)\n3. Assume the car was red. (Assumption for conditional proof)\n4. From 1, if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\n5. From 4 and 2, it follows that the truck must have been blue. (Modus ponens)\n6. This contradicts premise 2, which states that it's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\n7. Therefore, the assumption that the car was red leads to a contradiction.\n8. Thus, the assumption that the car was red is false.\n9. Therefore, the car was not red. (Conclusion of the conditional proof)\n\nBy following this logical reasoning, we can see that the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
