(Premise)\n2. It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo. (Premise)\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer the contrapositive: If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park. This is based on the logical equivalence of a conditional statement and its contrapositive.\n\nGiven premise 2, which states that Lucy did not go to the zoo, we can now conclude that Joe did not go to the park based on the contrapositive inference made from premise 1.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
