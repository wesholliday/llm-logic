(Premise)\n2. It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta. (Premise)\n3. Therefore, Sue did not choose pizza. (Conclusion)\n\nGiven the premises:\n- If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\n- It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\nWe can see that the argument is logically valid. If Bob did not choose pasta, then the first premise does not apply, and therefore we cannot conclude anything about Sue's choice based on that premise. Thus, the conclusion that Sue did not choose pizza logically follows from the premises provided. \n\nAnswer: yes",
