The first premise states: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\" This can be represented as: Shirt (cotton) \u2192 Pants (denim).\n\n2. The second premise states: \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\" This can be represented as: \u00acPants (denim).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The shirt was not cotton.\" This can be represented as: \u00acShirt (cotton).\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nIf Shirt (cotton) \u2192 Pants (denim) and \u00acPants (denim), we cannot directly conclude \u00acShirt (cotton) because the absence of denim pants does not necessarily mean the shirt was not cotton. There could be other types of pants that are not denim.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.",
