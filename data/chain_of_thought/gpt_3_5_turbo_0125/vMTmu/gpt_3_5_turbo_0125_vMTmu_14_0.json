If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den. (Premise)\n2. It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den. (Premise)\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer the contrapositive: If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\n\n3. If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave. (Inference from premise 1)\n\nGiven premise 2, which states that the wolf must not have been in the den, we can conclude that the bear was not in the cave based on the contrapositive derived from premise 1.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
