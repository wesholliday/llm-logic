It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding (Premise)\nConclusion: Mary was not at the wedding\n\nTo evaluate the validity, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In this case, the conclusion 'Mary was not at the wedding' does logically follow from the premises. If we assume the first premise is true (If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding), and the second premise is true (It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding), then it logically follows that Mary was not at the wedding since Sue must have been at the wedding for Mary to have been there.
