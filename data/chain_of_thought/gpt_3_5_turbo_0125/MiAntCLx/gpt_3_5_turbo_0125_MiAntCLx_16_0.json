In this case, the statement \"The wumble might be plonk flump\" does not logically lead to the statement \"The wumble might be plonk flump and snork zibber quank\" because the addition of \"and snork zibber quank\" is not a logical consequence of the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no",
