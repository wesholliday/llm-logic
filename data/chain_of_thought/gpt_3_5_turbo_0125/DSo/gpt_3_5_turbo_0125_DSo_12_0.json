Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it is hanging in the closet.\n\nIf the jacket isn't hanging in the closet, then it must be draped over the chair based on the second statement. This is because the second statement states that the jacket is either draped over the chair or hanging in the closet, and we already know it's not hanging in the closet. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
