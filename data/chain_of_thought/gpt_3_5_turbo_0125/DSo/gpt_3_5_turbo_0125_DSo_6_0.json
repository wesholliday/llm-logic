This means that the phone could be in the kitchen but not ringing, or it could be somewhere else.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the phone is either in the living room or ringing in the kitchen. Since we already know that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen, it must be in the living room according to the second statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes",
