This means that the cat could be playing somewhere else or napping on the couch.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the cat is either napping on the couch or playing in the bedroom. Since we already know that the cat is not playing in the bedroom, the only remaining option is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The cat is napping on the couch.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
