This leaves open the possibility that Fido could be elsewhere or even nowhere at all.\n\n2. \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" presents two options: Fido is inside, or Fido is in the garden. Since we already know from the first statement that Fido might not be in the garden, this second statement implies that if Fido is not in the garden, then he must be inside.\n\n3. However, the initial possibility that Fido might not be in the garden does not necessarily mean that he is inside. It could still be the case that Fido is not in the garden and also not inside. The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" does not provide enough information to determine where Fido is with certainty, other than ruling out the possibility of Fido being in the garden.\n\nBased on this analysis, we cannot definitively infer that",
