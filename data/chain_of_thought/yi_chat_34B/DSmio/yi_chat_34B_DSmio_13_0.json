It leaves open the possibility that the toy is in the toy box or somewhere else entirely.\n\n2. \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\" This statement presents a logical dichotomy: The toy is either in the toy box or on the bookshelf. There are no other options given.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that if the toy is not on the bookshelf (as per the first statement), then it must be in the toy box, because according to the second statement, those are the only two possibilities for the toy's location.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>",
