The statement \"The watch might not be on his wrist\" suggests that there is a possibility that the watch is not where it is typically found, which is on the person's wrist.\n2. The second statement, \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist,\" presents two options for the location of the watch: either it is on the person's wrist or it is charging on the dresser.\n3. Since we are given that the watch might not be on his wrist, we can eliminate the possibility that it is always on his wrist as a certainty. This leaves us with the second option, which is that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can infer that \"The watch is charging on the dresser\" because if it's not on his wrist and it has to be one of those two locations, then it must be the only remaining option.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
