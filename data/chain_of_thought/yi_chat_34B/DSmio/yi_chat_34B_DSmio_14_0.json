The statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the refrigerator where it would normally be expected to be chilled.\n2. The second statement, \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge,\" presents two options: the milk is either on the counter or in the fridge.\n3. Since we already know from the first statement that it might not be in the fridge, the only other option left is that it could be on the counter.\n4. Therefore, based on these two pieces of information, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
