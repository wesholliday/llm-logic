It leaves open the possibility that it is standing upright on the shelf, for example.\n\n2. \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\" This is an exclusive disjunction, meaning that the book cannot be both on the shelf and resting on the table at the same time. It asserts that the book's location is limited to one of these two options.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that if the book is not resting on the table (as per the first statement), then it must be on the shelf, because there are no other options presented.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END",
