            "content": "[RESP]Let's consider the given information step by step:\n\n1. We are told that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This is a conditional statement where 'Tom watching football' is the antecedent (P) and 'Jen watching basketball' is the consequent (Q). The condition can be represented as P \u2192 Q.\n\n2. We are also told that Jen did not watch basketball. This means that the consequent (Q) is false.\n\n3. In a conditional statement, if the consequent is false, then the whole conditional statement is considered false. This is because if the outcome (Q) does not happen, then the condition (P) cannot be the sole reason for it not happening; there could be other reasons.\n\n4. Since the conditional statement P \u2192 Q is false when Q is false, we can conclude that either P is false or there is some other factor involved that makes the whole statement false.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we cannot definitively say that Tom did not watch football just because Jen did not watch basketball. There could be another reason why the conditional statement is false, such as Tom not watching football for a different reason than Jen'",
