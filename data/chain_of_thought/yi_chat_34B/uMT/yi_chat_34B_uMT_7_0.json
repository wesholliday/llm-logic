Since Chris's non-finishing is a fact, we can infer that the condition stated in step 1 (Alex finishing leads to Chris finishing) does not apply in this case.\n\n3. If Alex finishing the race would have led to Chris finishing, but Chris did not finish, then by extension, Alex must also not have finished the race.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and our logical reasoning, we can conclude that:\n\nAnswer: no\uff0cAlex did not finish the race.<|im_end|>\n[THINK]\nTo determine whether Alex finished the race, let's consider the given information step by step:\n\n1.
