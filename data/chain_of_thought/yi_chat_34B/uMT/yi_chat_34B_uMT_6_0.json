This is a conditional statement where \"Sue choosing pizza\" is the antecedent (P) and \"Bob choosing pasta\" is the consequent (Q). The full statement can be written as P \u2192 Q.\n\n2. We are also told that Bob did not choose pasta. This means that the consequent (Q) of the conditional statement is false.\n\n3. If the consequent is false, then the entire conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) is false only if the antecedent (P) is true. In other words, for P \u2192 Q to be false, both P and not-Q must be true.\n\n4. Since we know that Bob did not choose pasta (not-Q is true), and for P \u2192 Q to be false, P would also need to be true. However, we are not given any information about whether Sue chose pizza (P) or not.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that Sue did not choose pizza. We can only conclude that if Sue",
