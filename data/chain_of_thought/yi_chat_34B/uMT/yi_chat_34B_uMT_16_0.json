The statement says \"if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This is a conditional statement where being cotton (for the shirt) is a necessary condition for the pants to be denim.\n\n2. The next part of the statement says \"the pants were not denim.\" Since this negates one half of the conditional statement, it means that the entire conditional cannot be true.\n\n3. If the pants are not denim, then the shirt cannot be cotton because if it were, the pants would have to be denim according to the original condition.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and our logical reasoning, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: no<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No, we cannot infer that the shirt was not cotton.
