We are given two pieces of information:\n   - If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n   - Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as an if-then statement: \"If Joe goes to the park, then Lucy goes to the zoo.\" This means that the condition (Joe going to the park) implies the result (Lucy going to the zoo).\n\n3. The second statement tells us that Lucy did not go to the zoo. Since this contradicts the first statement (which says that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy would have gone to the zoo), we can conclude that at least one of the conditions in the first statement is not true.\n\n4. There are two possibilities: either Joe did not go to the park, or Lucy did not go to the zoo (or both). Since we know that Lucy did not go to the zoo, and this contradicts the implication of the first statement, we can infer that Joe must not have gone to the park for the conditional statement to",
