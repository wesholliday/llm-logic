This is a conditional statement where \"Jeff playing basketball\" is the antecedent (P) and \"Amy playing tennis\" is the consequent (Q). We can represent this as P \u2192 Q.\n\n2. Amy did not play tennis. This means that the consequent (Q) is false.\n\nNow, we know from logic that if the consequent of a conditional statement is false, then the entire conditional statement is false. In other words, if Q is false, then P cannot be true for this particular instance.\n\nTherefore, since Amy did not play tennis (Q is false), we can conclude that Jeff did not play basketball (P is false) because the condition \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is not met when Amy does not play tennis.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n",
