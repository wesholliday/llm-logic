The book is not a mystery novel.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the book is not a mystery novel. Now, let's examine statement 1. Statement 1 tells us that if the book were written by James, it would be a mystery novel. However, since we already know from statement 2 that the book is not a mystery novel, this creates a logical contradiction.\n\nA logical contradiction occurs when two statements cannot both be true at the same time. In this case, we have:\n- The book being written by James (which would make it a mystery novel according to statement 1).\n- The book not being a mystery novel (as stated in statement 2).\n\nSince these two conditions cannot simultaneously hold true, we must conclude that at least one of the statements is false. Since we are given that the book is not a mystery novel (statement 2), which is true, then the only way to resolve the contradiction is for statement 1 to be false.\n\nTherefore, since statement ",
