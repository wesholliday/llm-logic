            "content": "[RESP]Let's consider the statements one by one:\n\n1. If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. This is a conditional statement where \"the doll being plastic\" is the antecedent (P) and \"the truck being metal\" is the consequent (Q). We can represent this as P \u2192 Q.\n\n2. The truck was not metal. This directly contradicts the consequence of the first statement, so we know that the conditional statement P \u2192 Q cannot be true given this new information.\n\nNow, since we know that P \u2192 Q is not true (because its consequent is false), we can conclude that either P is false or Q is false, or both. However, we are told that the truck was not metal, which means Q is false. If Q is false, then by the contrapositive of the conditional statement (which is logically equivalent to the original statement and reads as \"if the truck is not metal, then the doll is not plastic\"), we can infer that P must also be false.\n\nTherefore, since we know that the truck was not metal and this implies that the doll cannot be plastic, we can conclude that the doll was not plastic",
