We are given two statements:\n   - If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n   - Erin did not take a train.\n\n2. The first statement is an implication, which means that if the antecedent (Sam taking a plane) is true, then the consequent (Erin taking a train) must also be true. However, if the antecedent is false, the truth value of the consequent does not affect the validity of the implication.\n\n3. The second statement tells us that Erin did not take a train, which means the consequent in the first statement is false.\n\n4. Since we know that the consequent (Erin taking a train) is false, and the implication is still valid because it's an \"if-then\" statement, we can conclude that the antecedent (Sam taking a plane) must also be false.\n\n[REASON]\nBased on the above steps, we can reason that if Sam took a plane, then Erin would have taken a train, but since Erin did not take a train, it",
