The mummy was not awake.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the mummy was not awake. Since statement 1 is a conditional statement (if-then), we can use the contrapositive rule to make an inference. The contrapositive of 'If A then B' is 'If not B then not A.'\n\nSo, the contrapositive of statement 1 would be: If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\n\nSince we know from statement 2 that the mummy was not awake (not B), we can conclude according to the contrapositive rule that the vampire was not awake (not A).\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
