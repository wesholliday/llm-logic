This is a conditional statement: \"If griffin in forest, then unicorn in forest.\"\n\n2. We are also told that the unicorn was not in the forest. This is a factual statement.\n\n3. Since the unicorn was not in the forest, we can conclude from the first statement (the conditional) that the griffin must not have been in the forest, because if it were, the unicorn would also have to be there, which contradicts our second fact.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n",
