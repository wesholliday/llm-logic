We are given two statements:\n   - If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n   - Sue was not at the wedding.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\" This can be represented as A \u2192 B, where A is \"Mary was at the wedding,\" and B is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n3. The second statement tells us that B (Sue being at the wedding) is false.\n\n4. We need to determine whether we can infer that A (Mary being at the wedding) is also false.\n\n5. To do this, we can use the contrapositive of the conditional statement, which states that if B is false, then A must be false as well. This is because a conditional statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive.\n\n6. The contrapositive of A \u2192 B is ~B \u2192 ~A, where ~ represents negation. Since we know B (Sue being at the wedding) is false, according to the contrapositive, A (Mary being",
