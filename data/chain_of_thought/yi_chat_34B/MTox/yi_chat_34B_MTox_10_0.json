This means that if the wug was sproinged, we can conclude that it was also garbled.\n\nNow, let's try to infer whether \"The wug was not sproinged\" from these two statements:\n\n- If the wug were sproinged, then by the second statement, it would have been garbled.\n- But we already know from the first statement that the wug was not garbled.\n- Therefore, if the wug being sproinged would lead to it being garbled, and we know it wasn't garbled, we can conclude that the wug must not have been sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]",
