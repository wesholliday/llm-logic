To make this inference, we would need to know that the condition (being fleeked) did not occur, because if it did occur, then by the second statement, the clug would have snugged, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nHowever, we are not given any information about whether the clug was or was not fleeked. The only thing we know for sure is that the clug did not snug. Without additional information about the fleeking status of the clug, we cannot definitively infer that \"The clug was not fleeked.\"\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n",
