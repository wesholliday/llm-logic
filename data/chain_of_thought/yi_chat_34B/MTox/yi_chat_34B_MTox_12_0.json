If the smip did not lup the zoint as stated in the first sentence, then the condition of the second sentence (that if it were shripped, it would have lupped the zoint) is not met. Since the condition is not met, we can infer that the smip must not have been shripped, because if it had been, it would have lupped the zoint, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Yes<|im_end|>\n",
