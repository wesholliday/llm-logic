It implies that whenever the flugel is blimmed, it must also be zargled.\n\nNow, we are asked if we can infer \"The flugel was not blimmed\" from these two statements. To answer this, we need to consider the implications of the second statement in relation to the first.\n\nSince the first statement tells us that the flugel was not zargled (Q is false), according to the second statement (which is a conditional with Q as its conclusion), the antecedent P (the flugel was blimmed) must also be false. This is because if the consequence (Q) is false, and the conditional states that",
