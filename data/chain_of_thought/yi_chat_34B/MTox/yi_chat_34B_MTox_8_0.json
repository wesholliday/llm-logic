It does not specify what actions the sprocket did or did not undergo before or after this point.\n\n2. \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\" This is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between two events: if the sprocket is cranked, it must also be daggled. It does not tell us whether the sprocket was actually cranked or daggled; it only describes what would happen if it were to be cranked.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that since the sprocket was not daggled (according to statement 1) and if being cranked would have led to the sprocket being daggled (according to statement 2), then the sprocket must not have been cranked. This is because the condition (being cranked) does not lead to the observed outcome (not being daggled",
