It implies that whenever the fribble is snurgled, it also crinks.\n\nNow, we are asked to infer whether \"The fribble was not snurgled\" based on these two statements. To make this inference, we would need to know if the absence of B (crinking) can be attributed to the non-occurrence of A (snurging). However, the information provided is not sufficient to determine whether the lack of crinking means that the fribble was not snurgled. It could be that the fribble did not crink for some other reason, or perhaps there's another factor we're not aware of.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot defin",
