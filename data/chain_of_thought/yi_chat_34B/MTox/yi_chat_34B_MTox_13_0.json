If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged. This is a conditional statement (also known as an implication) that tells us if one thing happens (the glip being slogged), another thing must also happen (the glip being tragged).\n\nNow, we are asked to infer whether 'The glip was not slogged' based on these two pieces of information. To make this inference, we would need to show that if the first statement is true (the glip was not tragged) and the second statement is also true (if the glip was slogged, then it was tragged), then we can conclude that the glip must not have been slogged.\n\nHowever, there is a logical gap between what we know and what we want to infer. Just because we know that if the glip were slogged, it would be tragged, and we also know that the glip was not tragged, does not necessarily mean that the glip was not slogged. It could",
