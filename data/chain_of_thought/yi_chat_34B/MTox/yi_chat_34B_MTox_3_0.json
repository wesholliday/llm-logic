To make this inference, we need to consider the implications of the second statement in relation to the first.\n\nIf we assume that the conditional statement (if morph, then quank) is true, and we know from the first statement that the splat does not quank, then we can conclude that the condition (morphing) must not have occurred. This is because if it had occurred, the result (quanking) would also be present, according to the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the logical relationship between the statements, we can infer that \"The splat was not morphed.",
