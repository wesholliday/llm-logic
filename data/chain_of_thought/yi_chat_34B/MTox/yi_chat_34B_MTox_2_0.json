However, the first statement only tells us that the wug did not bim the zoint in normal circumstances; it does not preclude the possibility that the wug could have bimmed the zoint if it had been flooped.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer \"The wug was not flooped.\" The two statements are not sufficient to establish a contradiction or a definitive conclusion about whether the w",
