To answer this, let's consider the possibilities:\n\n- If the flug was not zimmed (as stated) and if being blummed would have led to it being zimmed (also stated), then we can conclude that the flug must not have been blummed, because if it were, it would contradict the first statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer \"The flug was not blummed.\"<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n",
