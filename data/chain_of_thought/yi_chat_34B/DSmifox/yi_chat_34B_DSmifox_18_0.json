It does not necessarily mean that it isn't, but there is a chance.\n\n2. \"Either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked.\" This is a logical statement that tells us that the shank has to be in one of two states: nugged or plooked. There are no other options given.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that if the shank is not nugged (which might be the case according to the first statement), then it must be plooked, because those are the only two possibilities presented in the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
