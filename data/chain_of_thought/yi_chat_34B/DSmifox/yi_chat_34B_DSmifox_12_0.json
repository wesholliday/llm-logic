It does not necessarily mean that it isn't, but there is a chance.\n\n2. \"Either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped.\" This is a logical statement that tells us that if the smip is not lupped, then it must be shriped. It presents two alternatives: being lupped or being shriped.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that if the smip is not lupped (which is a possibility according to the first statement), then it must be shriped, as per the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
