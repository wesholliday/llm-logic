It leaves open the possibility that the flugel could be zargled or not zargled.\n\n2. \"Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed.\" This statement presents a logical disjunction: The flugel must be in one of two states, either zargled or blimmed. It does not specify which state the flugel is in, only that it cannot be both zargled and blimmed at the same time.\n\nGiven these two statements together, we can infer that if the flugel is not zargled (which is a possibility according to the first statement), then by the second statement, it must be blimmed. However, since the first statement only suggests a possibility and does not rule out the flugel being zargled, we cannot definitively conclude that the flugel is blimmed based on the information",
