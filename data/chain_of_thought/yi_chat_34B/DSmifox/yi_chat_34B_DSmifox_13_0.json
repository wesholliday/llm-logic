It does not necessarily mean that it isn't tragged, but there is a chance.\n\n2. \"Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged.\" This is an exclusive disjunction, meaning that exactly one of two things must be true: either the glip is tragged, or it is slogged. It cannot be both, and it cannot be neither.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that if the glip is not tragged (which is a possibility according to the first statement), then by the second statement, it must be slogged. This is because the disjunction states that exactly one of the conditions must be true, and since we're considering the case where \"the glip might not be tragged,\" the only other option left is that it is slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
