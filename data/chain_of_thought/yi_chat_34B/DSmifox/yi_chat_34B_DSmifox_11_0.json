It could also mean that we don't have enough information to determine whether it is zimmed or not.\n\n2. \"Either the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed.\" This is a logical statement that tells us that the flug must be in one of two states: zimmed or blummed. There are no other options given.\n\nNow, let's consider what we can infer from these statements:\n\n- If the flug is not zimmed (based on the first statement), then it must be blummed according to the second statement, because there are only two possibilities given.\n\n- However, since the first statement leaves open the possibility that the flug might be zimmed, we cannot definitively say that the flug is blummed based solely on these two statements. We would need additional information to determine whether the flug is indeed zimmed",
