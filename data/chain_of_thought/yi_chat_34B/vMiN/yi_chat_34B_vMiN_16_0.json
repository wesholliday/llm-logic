This seems to imply that the presence of the pen in my bag is not necessary or guaranteed.\n\n3. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess whether the conclusion follows from the premise with logical necessity. In other words, does the possibility that the pen might not be in my bag necessarily mean that it is not the case that the pen must be in my bag?\n\n4. Intuitively, the argument seems to make sense because it is consistent with our understanding of how probabilities work. If something might not happen, then it is not certain that it will happen.\n\n5. Formally, the argument can be seen as an application of modus tollens, which is a valid logical form: from 'If A, then B' and 'Not B', we can conclude 'Not A'. In this case, 'A' represents 'The pen being in my",
