This means there exists a scenario where Mary is not present at the wedding.\n2. The conclusion asserts that it is not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding. In other words, there is no necessity for Mary to be at the wedding; it's possible for her to be absent.\n3. Since the premise already establishes a situation where Mary could be absent, and the conclusion simply affirms this possibility, the argument does not introduce any new information or scenarios that are not already implied by the premise.\n4. Therefore, given that the premise allows for the possibility of Mary's absence, the conclusion that she is not required to be present is a logical extension of the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
