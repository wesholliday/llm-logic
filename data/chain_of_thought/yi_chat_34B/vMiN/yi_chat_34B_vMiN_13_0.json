The conclusion states that it is not necessary for the toy to be in the toy box.\n3. Logical validity means that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n4. In this case, since the premise allows for the possibility of the toy not being in the toy box, the conclusion that it does not have to be in the toy box is a logical extension of that possibility.\n5. Therefore, the argument form is logically valid because the conclusion follows from the premise without any additional assumptions or information.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n",
