The premise indicates that there is a possibility, however small, that the dog might not have been inside.\n3. The conclusion then states that it is not the case that the dog must have been inside.\n4. Logically, if there is any possibility at all that the dog was not inside, then it cannot be said with certainty that the dog must have been inside.\n5. Therefore, based on the premise alone, the conclusion follows logically.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
