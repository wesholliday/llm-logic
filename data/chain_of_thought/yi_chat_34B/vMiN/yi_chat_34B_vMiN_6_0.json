            "content": "\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. The argument states that Sue might not have chosen pizza. This means there is a possibility, but not necessarily a certainty, that she did not choose pizza.\n2. The conclusion asserts that it is not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza. This seems to be saying that the choice of pizza for Sue is not mandatory or unavoidable.\n3. Logical validity refers to the relationship between the premises and the conclusion, where if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n4. In this argument, since the premise suggests a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza, and the conclusion states that she does not have to have chosen pizza, there is no logical contradiction or inconsistency.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, the form of the argument appears to be logically valid because the conclusion follows from the premise without any logical conflict.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n",
