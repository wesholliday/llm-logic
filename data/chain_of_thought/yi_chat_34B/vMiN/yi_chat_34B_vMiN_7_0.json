This means there is a possibility, but not a certainty, that Alex did not finish the race.\n2. The conclusion says it's not the case that Alex must have finished the race. This implies that the existence of the possibility (as stated in the premise) is enough to conclude that it is not necessary or certain that Alex finished the race.\n3. Logically, if there is a chance that something did not happen, then it cannot be said with certainty that it did happen. The conclusion is directly supported by the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
