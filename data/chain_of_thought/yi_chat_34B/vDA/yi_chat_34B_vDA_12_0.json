This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where P = 'Joe went to the park' and Q = 'Lucy went to the zoo'.\n\n2. The second premise says that Joe did not go to the park. This is a negation of the first part of the conditional statement (P).\n\n3. The conclusion states that Lucy did not go to the zoo, which is a negation of the second part of the conditional statement (Q).\n\n4. According to the rules of logic for conditional statements, if the antecedent (P) is false, then the entire conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is considered true regardless of the truth value of Q. This is because when P is false, Q cannot be made true by the condition.\n\n5. Since the first premise is a conditional statement that is always true when P is false (which it is according to the second premise), we cannot conclude anything about Q from this alone.\n\n6.
