The argument begins with a conditional statement (If A, then B), which means that if the first premise is true (the apple was red), then the second part (the banana was yellow) must also be true.\n\n2. The second premise states that the apple was not red, which directly contradicts the first premise. Since both premises cannot be true at the same time, we have a logical contradiction.\n\n3. The conclusion is based on the assumption that since the apple was not red (which makes the first premise false), then the banana must not have been yellow. However, this does not follow logically from the second premise alone; it requires the truth of the first premise to be validly inferred.\n\n4. Since there is a logical contradiction between the premises and the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the information provided, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n\n",
