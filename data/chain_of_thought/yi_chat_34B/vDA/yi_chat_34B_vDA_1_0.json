            "content": "[RESP]To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure using the rules of logic. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Understanding Premises and Conclusion**: The first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\" where A is 'Mary being at the wedding' and B is 'Sue being at the wedding'.\n\n2. **Evaluating Premises**: The second premise states that Mary was not at the wedding. Since this contradicts the first premise (which implies that if Mary is not at the wedding, then Sue cannot be at the wedding), we have a logical issue.\n\n3. **Considering the Conclusion**: The conclusion states that Sue was not at the wedding. This directly follows from the second premise, which says Mary was not at the wedding and the first premise, which implies that if Mary is not at the wedding, then Sue cannot be at the wedding.\n\n4. **Assessing Validity**: A valid argument is one where the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion does follow from the second premise alone,",
