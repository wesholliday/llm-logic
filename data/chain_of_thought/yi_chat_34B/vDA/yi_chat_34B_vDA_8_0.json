            "content": "\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. The first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was also awake. This establishes a conditional relationship between the two entities: Vampire awake \u2192 Mummy awake.\n\n2. The second premise says that the vampire was not awake. This provides us with information about one side of the conditional relationship: Not (Vampire awake).\n\n3. The conclusion states that the mummy was not awake. This is what we are trying to determine based on the given premises.\n\nTo assess the logical validity of this argument, we need to determine if the conclusion must be true given the premises. In a valid argument form, if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nIn this case, since the first premise is a conditional (If A then B) and the second premise negates the antecedent (Not A), according to the logical rule of modus tollens, we can infer that the consequent (B) does not have to be true. Therefore, the conclusion (Mummy was not awake) is not necessarily true given the premises.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n\n",
