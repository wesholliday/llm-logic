The argument begins with a conditional statement (If A, then B), which means that if the first premise is true (the car was red), then the second part (the truck was blue) must also be true.\n\n2. The second premise states that the car was not red, which directly contradicts the first premise. Since both premises cannot be true at the same time, we have a logical contradiction.\n\n3. The conclusion is based on the assumption that since the car was not red (which makes the first premise false), then the truck must not have been blue (the second part of the conditional statement). However, this conclusion does not follow logically from the premises as given.\n\n4. A valid argument is one where the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. In this case, because the premises are contradictory and do not support each other, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n\n",
