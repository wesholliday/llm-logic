The argument has two premises (If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train; Sam did not take a plane) and a conclusion (Erin did not take a train).\n\nThe first premise is an \"if-then\" statement, which in classical logic can be represented by the conditional proposition A \u2192 B, where A is 'Sam took a plane' and B is 'Erin took a train'. The second premise negates the antecedent of this conditional, that is, it states \u00acA (Sam did not take a plane). The conclusion affirms the consequent of the conditional, that is, it states \u00acB (Erin did not take a train).\n\nThe logical form of the argument can be represented as follows:\n\n1. A \u2192 B (If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train)\n2. \u00acA (Sam did not take a plane)\n3. \u00acB (Erin did not take a train)\n\nThis structure is similar to that of the logical fallacy known as",
