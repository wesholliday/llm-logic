This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where P represents \"Tom watched football\" and Q represents \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\n2. The second premise says that Tom did not watch football. This provides us with information about one part of the conditional statement (P) being false.\n\n3. The conclusion states that Jen did not watch basketball. This is claiming that Q, the other part of the conditional statement, is also false.\n\n4. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the truth value of the second premise (Tom not watching football) guarantees the truth of the conclusion (Jen not watching basketball) according to the rules of logic for conditional statements.\n\n5. In a standard \"If P, then Q\" statement, when P is false, the statement is considered true regardless of the truth value of Q. This is because if the condition (P) never occurs, the consequence (Q) cannot be said to follow from it.\n\n6. Applying this logic to the argument at hand, since we know that Tom did",
