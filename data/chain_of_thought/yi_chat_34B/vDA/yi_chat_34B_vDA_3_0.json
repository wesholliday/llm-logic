This can be represented as an implication: If A (James wrote the book), then B (the book is a mystery novel).\n\n2. The second premise says that the book was not written by James, which means the condition A (James writing the book) is false.\n\n3. In a valid argument with an implication as its first premise, if the condition (A) is false, then the conclusion must be true regardless of whether B (the book being a mystery novel) is true or false. This is because when the condition is false, the entire implication becomes true<|im_end|>\n\n4. Since the second premise establishes that A (James writing the book) is false, according to the first premise's logic, B (the book being a mystery novel) must also be false.\n\n5. The conclusion states that the book is not a mystery novel, which matches the logical outcome of the first premise when the condition A is false.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the argument form is logically valid because it follows the rules of logic for implications: if the",
