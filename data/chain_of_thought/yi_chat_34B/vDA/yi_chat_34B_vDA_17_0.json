The second premise says that Ben did not eat pasta (negation of the antecedent).\n3. The conclusion claims that Kate did not eat salad (negation of the consequent).\n\nIn a valid argument form known as modus tollens, if the antecedent (if P then Q) is false and the negation of the antecedent (not P) is true, then the negation of the consequent (not Q) must also be true. This is because if the condition (P) never occurred, then the consequence (Q) could not have been caused by it.\n\nHowever, in this argument, we are given that Ben did not eat pasta, which is the negation of the antecedent. Therefore, according to modus tollens, Kate should indeed have eaten salad (the consequent) since the condition (Ben eating pasta) was never met.\n\nThe argument appears to be invalid because it does not follow the rules of logical inference for a valid argument form such as modus tollens.
