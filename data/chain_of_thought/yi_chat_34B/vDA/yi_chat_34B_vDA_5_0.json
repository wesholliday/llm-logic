            "content": "\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. The first premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where P represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q represents \"Amy played tennis\".\n\n2. The second premise says that Jeff did not play basketball. This is a negation of the first part of the conditional statement (P).\n\n3. The conclusion states that Amy did not play tennis, which is a negation of the second part of the conditional statement (Q).\n\n4. In a valid argument form known as modus tollens, if the antecedent (P) is false, then the consequent (Q) must also be false. This is because if P is not true, then the entire condition \"If P, then Q\" does not apply, and Q can be any state without affecting the truth value of the conditional statement.\n\n5. In this argument, since the first premise is a conditional statement and the second premise negates the antecedent (P), it follows logically that the consequent (Q) must also be false, which is what the conclusion states.\n",
