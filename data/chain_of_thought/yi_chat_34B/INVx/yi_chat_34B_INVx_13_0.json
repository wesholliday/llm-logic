In other words, if we can prove that \"If the glip was not slogged, then the glip was not tragged,\" it would be equivalent to proving the original statement.\n\nHowever, just because A (the glip being slogged) is true does not necessarily mean that not A (the glip not being slogged) is false. Similarly, if B (the glip being tragged) is true, it does not imply that not B (the glip not being tragged) is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot directly infer \"If the glip was not slogged, then the glip was not tragged\" from the given statement \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\" The two events (slogging and tragging) are not necessarily linked in a way that",
