These are made-up terms without any specific definitions provided, so we cannot determine their relationship logically without further context or a definition of these actions.\n\nWithout knowing precisely what \"sploffed\" and \"plopped the frink\" refer to, we cannot definitively infer anything about the grommet's state or actions when one condition is reversed. Therefore, based on the information given",
