To answer this question, let's consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive is formed by flipping both the hypothesis and the conclusion of an implication and then negating both. So, for \"Fleeked \u2192 Snugged,\" the contrapositive would be \"Not Fleeked \u2192 Not Snugged.\"\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement (i.e., if one is true, so is the other), we can infer that \"If the clug was not fleeked, then the clug was not snugged\" is indeed a valid inference from the original statement.<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END",
