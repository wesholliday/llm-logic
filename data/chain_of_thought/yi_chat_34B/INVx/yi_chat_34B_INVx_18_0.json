In other words, if we can prove that \"If the shank was not plooked, then the shank was not nugged,\" it would be equivalent to proving the original statement.\n\nHowever, just because A (the shank being plooked) is true does not necessarily mean that B (the shank being nugged) is also true. The original statement only tells us that if A is true, then B must also be true. It does not tell us anything about the relationship between A and B when A is false.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided by the original statement, we cannot infer \"If the shank was not plooked, then the shank was not nugged.\" The truth of one condition (being plooked) does not necessarily imply the truth of",
