According to the rules of logic, if the original statement (A \u2192 B) is true, then its contrapositive (not A \u2192 not B) must also be true. This is because they are logically equivalent in a biconditional sense: (A \u2192 B) \u2194 (not A \u2192 not B).\n\nSo, if we know that \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\" is true, we can infer that its contrapositive, \"If the zinger was not fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled,\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response. Thank you for your question. If you have any further questions or need assistance with anything else, please",
