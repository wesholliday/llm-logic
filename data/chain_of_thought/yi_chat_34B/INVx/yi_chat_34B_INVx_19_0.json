In other words, if we want to infer \"If the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk was not plagged,\" we need to find the contrapositive of the given statement.\n\nThe contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement because they both have the same truth table: If A is true, B must also be true; if A is false, it doesn't matter what the truth value of B is (and vice versa).\n\nTherefore, based on the logical equivalence of the contrapositive and the original statement, we can infer that \"If the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk was not plagged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]The response is correct.
