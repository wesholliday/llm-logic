To find the contrapositive, we need to negate both parts of the conditional:\n\nnot(A) is \"the smip was not shripped,\" and\nnot(B) is \"the smip did not lup the zoint.\"\n\nSo, the contrapositive would be: \"If the smip was not shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the original statement and its contrapositive in terms of truth values:\n\n1. If A is true (the smip was shripped), then B must also be true (the smip lupped the zoint). This is the original statement.\n2. If not(B) is true (the",
