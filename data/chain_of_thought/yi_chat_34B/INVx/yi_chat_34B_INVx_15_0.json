The converse would be true if the original statement were a biconditional, meaning that P and Q were both necessary and sufficient for each other. But since we only have one direction of implication in the original statement, we cannot infer the converse without additional information.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given statement \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened,\"",
