In other words, if we negate both parts of the original condition (wug was not sproinged and it was not garpled), we get the contrapositive.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"From 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled', can we infer 'If the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled'?\" This is asking if the original statement implies its contrapositive.\n\nIn logic, the rule of contraposition states that for any conditional statement A \u2192 B, its contrapositive not A \u2192 not B is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if one form is true, so is the other.\n\nTherefore, based on the principle of contraposition, we can infer that \"If the wug was",
