According to the law of contraposition in logic, if a conditional statement is true, its contrapositive will also be true.\n\nHowever, the question asks about the converse of the original statement, which is \"If the twonk was not plinked, then it was not varnished\" (not A \u2192 not B). The converse of an implication is not necessarily true just because the original implication is true. In other words, knowing that 'if A then B' is true does not automatically mean that 'if not A then not B' is also true.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided by the statement \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished,\" we cannot infer",
