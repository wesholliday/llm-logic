In other words, if we can prove that when the fribble is not snurgled, it does not crink, then we have established the validity of the original statement's contrapositive.\n\nHowever, the information provided only tells us what happens when the fribble is snurgled (it crinked). It does not specify what happens when the fribble is not snurgled. Therefore, based on the given information alone, we cannot infer that if the fribble was not snurgled, then it did not crink.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No",
