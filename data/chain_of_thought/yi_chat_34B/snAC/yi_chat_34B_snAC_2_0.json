This statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as Griffin \u21d2 Unicorn. The truth of this statement means that whenever the griffin is in the forest, the unicorn must also be in the forest.\n\n2. \"The unicorn was in the forest\" is true. This statement tells us that the unicorn's location is in the forest.\n\nNow, we need to determine if it follows that \"The griffin was in the forest\" is true. To do this, we can use the transitive property of logic, which states that if A \u21d2 B and B \u21d2 C are both true, then A \u21d2 C is also true.\n\nIn our case:\n- A = Griffin (in the forest)\n- B = Unicorn (in the forest)\n- C = Griffin (in the forest)\n\nSince we know that Unicorn (B) is in the forest and that if Griffin (A) is in the forest",
