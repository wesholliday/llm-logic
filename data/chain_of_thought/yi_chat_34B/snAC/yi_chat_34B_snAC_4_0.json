If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter (conditional statement).\n2. The robot visited Jupiter (consequent of the conditional statement).\n\nAccording to the rules of logic for a conditional statement, if the consequent is true, then the antecedent must also be true in order for the conditional statement to be true. Since we know that the robot visited Jupiter (the consequent) and the conditional statement is true, it follows logically that the alien must have visited Mars (the antecedent).\n\nTherefore, 'The alien visited Mars' is indeed true.<|im_end|>\n\n[ANSWER]Answer: yes<|im_end|><|im_end|>\n\n[THINK]To further clarify, let's consider the logical implications of the given statements:\n\n- The conditional statement \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" can be represented as A \u2192 B, where A is \"The alien visited Mars\" and B is \"The robot visited Jupiter.\"\n- We are told that this conditional statement is true.\n- Additionally, we know that \"",
