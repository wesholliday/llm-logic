Since Premise 1 states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would be, and since we now know that Sue is indeed at the wedding, we can infer that the condition for Sue's presence (Mary being at the wedding) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical connection between the two premises, it necessarily follows that 'Mary was at the wedding' is true.<|im_end|>\n\n[ANSWER]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n[END]<|im_end|>\n\n[THINK]\nTo determine whether 'Mary was at the wedding' is true given the information provided, we can use a logical approach.
