If 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim' is true and 'The pants were denim' is true, we can infer that the first statement acts as a condition for the second statement. In other words, whenever the first statement (the condition) is true, the second statement (the consequence) must also be true. Since we know that the second statement is true ('The pants were denim'), it means that the condition (the shirt being cotton) must also be true.
