We are given two pieces of information:\n   - \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" (conditional statement)\n   - \"Lucy went to the zoo\" (consequent of the conditional statement)\n\n2. The first piece of information is a conditional statement, which can be represented as an if-then proposition: If A (Joe goes to the park), then B (Lucy goes to the zoo).\n\n3. The second piece of information tells us that the consequent B (Lucy going to the zoo) is true.\n\n4. To determine whether the antecedent A (Joe going to the park) is also true, we need to consider the truth value of the conditional statement as a whole.\n\n5. In a valid argument, if the consequent is true and the conditional statement is true, then the antecedent must be true as well. This is because if the condition (A) is met, and the result (B) follows, then we can conclude that A is true.\n\n6. However, in this scenario, we are only given that B (Lucy going",
