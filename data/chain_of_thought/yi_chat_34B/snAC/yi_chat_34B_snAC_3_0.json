Since this statement is true, it confirms that the book indeed is a mystery novel.\n\nStep 3: To determine if \"The book was written by James\" is true, we would need to consider the truth value of the hypothesis (antecedent) and apply the rules of inference for conditional statements. However, we are only given information about the conclusion (consequent) being true.\n\nStep 4: In a hypothetical situation where both the conditional statement and its consequent are true, it would imply that the antecedent (\"The book was written by James\") must also be true for the conditional to hold. However, we have not been given enough information to determine the truth value of the ant",
