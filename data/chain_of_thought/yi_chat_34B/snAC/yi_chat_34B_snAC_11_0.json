We have two premises:\n\n1. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry (conditional statement).\n2. The muffins were blueberry (consequent of the conditional statement).\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer that since the second premise is true (the muffins were blueberry) and it matches the consequent of the first premise, then the condition of the first premise must also be true. Therefore, we can conclude that:\n\n- The cake was chocolate.\n\nThis is because if the conditional statement is true, and its consequent is observed to be true, then by definition, the condition (in this case, 'The cake was chocolate') must be true as well.<|im_end|>\n[ANSWER]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[THINK]\nTo determine whether 'The cake was chocolate' follows from the given information, we need to consider the logical implications of the statements provided.
