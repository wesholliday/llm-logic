If both 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis' and 'Amy played tennis' are true, we can use the transitive property of logic to deduce that 'Jeff played basketball' must also be true. However, it is important to note that if only 'Amy played tennis' is true, without the condition 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis,' we cannot conclude anything about whether Jeff played basketball.<|im_end|>\n\n[ANSWER]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n[THINK]To further clarify my reasoning, let's break down the statements provided:\n\n1. \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is a conditional statement that can be represented as A \u2192 B, where A = \"Jeff played basketball\" and B = \"Amy played tennis.\"\n2. \"Amy played tennis\" is a factual statement that we know to be true.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can apply the transitive property of logic, which states that if A \u2192 B is true and B is true, then A must also be",
