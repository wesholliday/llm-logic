            "content": "[THINK]To determine whether 'The doll was plastic' follows from the given information, we need to consider the logical implications of the statements. If both 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' and 'The truck was metal' are true, we can infer that the condition for the first statement (the doll being plastic) must be met since its consequence (the truck being metal) is true and the condition did not prevent it. Therefore, if 'The truck was metal' is true, then 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' implies that 'The doll was plastic' must also be true.<|im_end|>\n\n[ANSWER]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n[THINK]To further clarify, we can use a truth table to analyze the logical connectives involved. The statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' is a conditional statement, which in symbolic form is written as A \u2192 B, where A represents 'The doll was plastic' and B represents 'The truck was metal'.\n\nAccording to the truth table for conditionals, if both the antecedent (A) and the consequent (B) are true, then the entire conditional statement (",
