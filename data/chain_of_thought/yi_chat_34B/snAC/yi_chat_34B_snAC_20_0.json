If 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' is true and 'The banana was yellow' is true, we can infer that the condition for the first statement (the apple being red) must be met since its consequence (the banana being yellow) has been confirmed. Therefore, it does follow that 'The apple was red' is true.<|im_end|>\n\n[ANSWER]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n\n[THINK]To further elaborate on the reasoning, we can use a truth table to analyze the logical implications of the given statements. The first statement, 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' is a conditional statement that can be represented as A \u2192 B, where A is 'The apple was red' and B is 'The banana was yellow'. The second statement, 'The banana was yellow' (B) is given as true.\n\nAccording to the truth table for conditionals, if both the antecedent (A) and the consequent (B) are true, then the conditional A \u2192 B is true.
