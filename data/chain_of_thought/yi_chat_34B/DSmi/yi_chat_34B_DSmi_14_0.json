The statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" tells us that there are only two possibilities for where the milk could be: on the counter or in the fridge.\n2. The second statement, \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge,\" suggests that one of those possibilities may not be true.\n3. If we cannot eliminate both possibilities, then we cannot definitively conclude that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n\n",
