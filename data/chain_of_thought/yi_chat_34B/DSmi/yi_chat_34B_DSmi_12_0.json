It implies that one of these situations must be true, but not both.\n\n2. \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\" This statement suggests that while there is a possibility that the jacket is hanging in the closet, it is not certain.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that if the jacket is not hanging in the closet (as stated in the second condition), then the only other option left is for the jacket to be draped over the chair. This is because the first statement tells us that exactly one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can conclude that if the jacket is not hanging in the closet, it must be draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
