However, statement 2 tells us that there is a possibility that the pen is not on the desk. Since both statements are given to be true, we can conclude that if the pen is not on the desk (as stated in 2), then it must be in the bag (as per the exclusive disjunction in 1).\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
