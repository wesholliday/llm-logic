The statement \"Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch\" tells us that there are only two possible locations for the newspaper: in the driveway or on the porch.\n2. The second statement, \"The newspaper might not be sitting on the porch,\" suggests that one of the two possibilities may not be true.\n3. Since we have been given two mutually exclusive options (in the driveway or on the porch) and told that one of them might not be true, it implies that if the newspaper is not on the porch, then it must be in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
