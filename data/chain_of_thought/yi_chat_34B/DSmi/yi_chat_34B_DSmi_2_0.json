The statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" tells us that there are only two possible locations for the book: on the shelf or on the table.\n2. The second statement, \"The book might not be resting on the table,\" suggests that one of the possibilities (it being on the table) is less likely or has a lower probability of occurring.\n3. Since there are only two options and we have information that eliminates one option (being on the table), by process of elimination, we can infer that the book must be in the only remaining location: on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
