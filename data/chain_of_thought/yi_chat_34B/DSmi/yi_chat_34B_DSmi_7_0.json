It does not specify which one it is, but we know it must be one of these two places.\n\n2. \"The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet.\" This statement suggests that while the umbrella could be in the closet, it is not necessarily there. It leaves open the possibility that the umbrella is somewhere else.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that if the umbrella is not in the closet (because \"might not\" implies a possibility), then it must be in the car, as per the first statement.
