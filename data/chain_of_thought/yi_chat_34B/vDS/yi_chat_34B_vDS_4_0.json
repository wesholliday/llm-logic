The first premise states that there are two possibilities for the cat's location: either it's napping on the couch or playing in the bedroom.\n2. The second premise rules out one of those possibilities, namely that the cat is not playing in the bedroom.\n3. Since both premises cannot be true at the same time (a cat cannot simultaneously nap on the couch and play in the bedroom), the only remaining possibility is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n4. Therefore, given the first premise and the second premise, the conclusion logically follows as the only possible option left.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
