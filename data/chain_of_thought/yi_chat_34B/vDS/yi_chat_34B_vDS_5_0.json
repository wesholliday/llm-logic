This is a statement of exclusivity; it implies that there are only two possibilities for where the cookies can be.\n\n2. The second premise asserts that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry. Since the first premise presents two options and the second premise rules out one of them, this leaves only one option unaccounted for.\n\n3. The conclusion states that since the cookies are not in the pantry (as per the second premise) and there are only two possibilities (as per the first premise), the cookies must be in the jar.\n\nThe form of argument is logically valid because if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. The reasoning follows a deductive pattern where the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
