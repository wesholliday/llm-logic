This is a disjunction of two possibilities.\n2. The second premise denies one of those possibilities, namely that the umbrella is not tucked away in the closet.\n3. Logically, when you negate one possibility in a disjunction, the other possibility must be true, because the disjunction as a whole cannot be false if one part is true.\n4.
