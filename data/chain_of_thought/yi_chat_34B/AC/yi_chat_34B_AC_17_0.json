The statement can be represented as P \u2192 Q.\n\n2. \"Kate ate the salad.\" This is an assertion of one of the possible consequences from the first statement. It tells us that Q is true.\n\nNow, we are asked if we can infer 'Ben ate pasta' (P) from these two statements. To infer P, we need to use the rule of inference for conditional statements, which states that if a conditional statement P \u2192 Q and Q are both true, then we can conclude P. However, this rule only applies when P is not already known to be false.\n\nIn our case, we have no information about whether Ben ate pasta or not. The first statement does not tell us what happened if Ben did not eat pasta; it only tells us that if he did, Kate would have eaten the salad. Since we know that Kate ate the salad (Q is true),",
