The truth of the consequent does not guarantee the truth of the antecedent in a conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that \"Joe went to the park\" just because \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n",
