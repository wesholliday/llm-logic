We are given two premises:\n   - Premise 1: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n   - Premise 2: Sue was at the wedding.\n\n2. According to the first premise (Premise 1), if Mary were at the wedding, it would guarantee that Sue is also at the wedding.\n\n3. The second premise (Premise 2) tells us that Sue is indeed at the wedding.\n\n4. Since Premise 2 confirms that Sue is at the wedding, which is a consequence of Premise 1 if Mary were present, we can infer that Mary's presence would be consistent with what we know from Premise 2.\n\n5. However, the first premise only tells us that if Mary is there, then Sue must also be there; it does not guarantee that because Sue is there, Mary must be there as well. It could be that someone else (not Mary) is the reason why Sue is at the wedding according to Premise 1.\n\n6. Therefore, while we can conclude that Mary's presence would be consistent with the information",
