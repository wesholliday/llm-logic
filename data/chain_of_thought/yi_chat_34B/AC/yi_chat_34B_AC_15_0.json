The first statement is \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"if P, then Q,\" where P represents \"Sam took a plane\" and Q represents \"Erin took a train.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Erin took a train.\" This is an assertion that Q (Erin taking a train) is true.\n\n3. We are asked to determine if we can infer P (Sam taking a plane) from the combination of these two statements.\n\nIn logic, if a conditional statement is true and its consequent (Q in this case) is known to be true, then we can infer the truth of the antecedent (P). This is because the conditional statement is logically equivalent to \"If P is true, Q must also be true.\" Since we know that Q is true, we can conclude that P must also be true for the conditional statement to be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the logic of conditional statements, if we",
