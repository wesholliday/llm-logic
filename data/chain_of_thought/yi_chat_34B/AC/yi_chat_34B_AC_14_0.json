In other words, just because the wolf being in the den implies that the bear was in the cave, and we know the wolf was in the den, it does not automatically mean that the bear was in the cave. There could be other conditions or scenarios where the wolf might be in the den without the bear being in the cave.\n\nTherefore, based on",
