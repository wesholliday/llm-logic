            "content": "[RESP]Step 1: Consider the first statement, \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This is an example of a conditional statement in logic, where the first part (the antecedent) is \"The book was written by James,\" and the second part (the consequent) is \"The book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nStep 2: The second statement provided is \"The book is a mystery novel.\" This matches the consequent of the conditional statement.\n\nStep 3: In a valid argument from a conditional statement, if the consequent is true, then the antecedent must also be true. This is because the conditional statement asserts that if the first part (the antecedent) is true, then the second part (the consequent) must also be true.\n\nStep 4: Since we have established that the book is a mystery novel (the consequent) and we are given that if the book was written by James, it would be a mystery novel (the conditional statement), we can infer that the book was indeed written by James (the antecedent).\n\nAnswer: Yes<|im_end|>\n",
