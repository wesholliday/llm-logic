However, the conditional statement A \u2192 B does not guarantee that A is true if B is true. The truth of B only confirms that the condition A would make B true, but it does not confirm that A itself is true.\n\nIn other words, we can say that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball, but knowing that Jen watched basketball does not necessarily mean that Tom watched football. There are two possibilities:\n\n- Tom watched football (A is true), which makes it certain that Jen watched basketball (B is true).\n- Tom did not watch football (A is false), but for some other reason, Jen still watched basketball (B is true).\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided",
