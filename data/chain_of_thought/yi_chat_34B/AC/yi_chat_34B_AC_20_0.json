It only tells us that if the apple were red, the banana would be yellow.\n\nStep 2: We are also given that \"The banana was yellow.\" This is one possible outcome of the conditional statement but does not provide any information about whether the apple was actually red or not. It could be that the apple was red and thus the banana was indeed yellow, but we cannot conclude this based on the information provided.\n\nStep 3: To infer 'The apple was red' from the given statements would require additional information that the apple being red is the only condition under which the banana would be yellow. Without such information, we cannot logically deduce that the apple was red just because the banana was yellow.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided statements and the rules of logical inference, we cannot infer 'The apple was red' from 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' and 'The banana was yellow.'<|im_end|>\n[RESP",
