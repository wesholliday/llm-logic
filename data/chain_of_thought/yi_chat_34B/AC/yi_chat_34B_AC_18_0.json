However, it does not necessarily mean that P (the doll being plastic) is true because there could be other reasons for Q (the truck being metal) to be true without P being true.\n\n- For us to infer that the doll was plastic from the information provided, we would need additional evidence or a different logical connection between the doll and the truck. The given statement only tells us that if the doll were plastic, then the truck would be metal, but it does not guarantee that the doll's material directly influences or",
