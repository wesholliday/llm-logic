If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel (Premise 2).\n\nFrom Premise 2, we can infer that if James wrote the book, it would be a mystery novel. However, Premise 2 does not tell us whether James actually did write the book; it only establishes a conditional relationship between James' authorship and the genre of the book.\n\nPremise 1 tells us that the book is a mystery novel, but it does not specify who wrote it. Since we are asked to infer whether the book was written by James based on these two premises alone, we must consider the logical connection between them.\n\nThe problem here is that there is no direct link provided between Premise 1 (the book's genre) and Premise 2 (James' potential authorship). We are not given any additional information that would allow us to conclude definitively that James wrote the book just because it is a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot",
