If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nThe first statement tells us that the truck is made of metal. This is an established fact and does not depend on any other condition or assumption.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement in the form of an if-then proposition: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This means that if we know the doll is plastic, it implies that the truck is metal. However, the converse is not necessarily true; knowing that the truck is metal does not automatically tell us anything about the material of the doll.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer that the doll was plastic. The only thing we know for sure is that the truck was metal.<|im_end|>\n[ANSWER]Answer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[THINK]To determine if we can infer that the doll was plastic from the information provided, let's break down the statements given:\n\n1.
