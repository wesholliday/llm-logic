The first statement tells us that the banana was yellow. This is an established fact.\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P then Q\" where P (the apple was red) is the hypothesis and Q (the banana was yellow) is the conclusion.\n\nNow, we have two options:\n\n- If P is true (i.e., if the apple was red), then according to the conditional statement, Q must also be true (the banana was yellow). However, since we already know that Q is true from the first statement, this doesn't provide us with any new information about P.\n- If P is false (i.e., if the apple was not red), then the conditional statement does not apply, and we still cannot infer anything about P from the given information.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively infer that 'The apple was red' because the second statement only tells us what would be true if the apple were red, but it does",
