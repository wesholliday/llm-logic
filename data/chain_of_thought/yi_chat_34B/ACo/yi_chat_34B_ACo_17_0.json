It tells us that Kate consumed salad.\n2. \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" is a conditional statement. It establishes a relationship between two possible events: if one occurs (Ben eating pasta), the other must also occur (Kate eating salad).\n\nNow, we are asked whether, from these two statements, we can infer that \"Ben ate pasta\". To infer this, we would need to reverse the conditional statement and assume that Kate ate salad (which we know is true). The reversed conditional would be: \"If Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta\".\n\nHowever, there is a logical issue with this reversal. A conditional statement does not work both ways; you cannot infer the antecedent from the consequent without additional information. In other words, knowing that Kate ate salad tells us nothing about whether Ben ate pasta or not. The original conditional only guarantees that if Ben did eat pasta, then Kate would have eaten salad as well.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer that \"Ben ate pasta\"",
