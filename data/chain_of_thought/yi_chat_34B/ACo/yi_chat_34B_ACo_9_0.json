The statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement with 'Lisa buying the red shirt' as the antecedent and 'Mark buying the blue shirt' as the consequent (Conditional B).\n3. We are asked to infer whether 'Lisa bought the red shirt' (Inference C).\n\nFrom Fact A, we know that Mark bought the blue shirt. Conditional B tells us that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark would buy the blue shirt. Since we already have evidence that Mark bought the blue shirt (Fact A), it suggests that the condition in Conditional B must be true for the consequence to occur.\n\nTherefore, based on our reasoning, we can infer 'Lisa bought the red shirt' (Inference C).\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response. Thank you for your question. If you have any further questions or need assistance with anything else, please let me know!<|im_end|>",
