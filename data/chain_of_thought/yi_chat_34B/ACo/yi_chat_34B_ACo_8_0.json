This does not directly tell us anything about the vampire's state of being awake or asleep.\n\nStatement 2 is an \"if-then\" statement, which means it expresses a conditional relationship between two events.

However, this statement does not provide any information about whether the vampire itself was actually awake or not. It only tells us what would happen if it were.\n\nGiven these statements alone, we cannot logically infer that the vampire was awake.
