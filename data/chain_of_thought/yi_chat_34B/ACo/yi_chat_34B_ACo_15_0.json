However, the conditional statement only tells us that if Sam did take a plane, then Erin would have taken a train. It does not guarantee that Sam actually took a plane. The fact that Erin took a train does not necessarily mean that Sam also took a plane because there is no direct link between Erin's action and Sam's potential action in the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer 'Sam took a plane.'\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Explanation: The conditional statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" does",
