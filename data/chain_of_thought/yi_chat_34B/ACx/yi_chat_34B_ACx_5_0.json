We have two statements:\n   - If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled (conditional statement in the form of an if-then proposition).\n   - The zinger was smoogled (premise that the second part of the conditional is true).\n\n2. According to the rules of logic for a valid modus ponens argument, if the antecedent (the 'if' part) of a conditional statement is true and the consequent (the 'then' part) is also true, we can infer that the entire conditional statement is true.\n\n3. In this case, since we know the zinger was smoogled (which is the consequent of the conditional) and we have not been given any information to suggest that the zinger was not fraggled (the antecedent of the conditional), we can infer that the zinger must have been fraggled for the conditional to be true.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
