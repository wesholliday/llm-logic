According to the rules of logic, when you have a valid conditional statement (if A then B) and you know that B has happened, you cannot automatically conclude that A must have happened without further information. The reason is that there could be other conditions or factors that lead to B happening without A being true.\n\nIn this case, we know that the sneg sproted the frink (B), but we do not have enough information to determine whether the sneg was crampled (A) must have been the cause of it. There could be other reasons why the sneg spro",
