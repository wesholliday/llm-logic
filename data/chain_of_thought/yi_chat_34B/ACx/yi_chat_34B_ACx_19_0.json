We have a conditional statement: \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\" This means that if the smonk was in a certain state (vreebled), it would result in another state (plagged).\n\n2. We are also given the information that \"The smonk plagged.\" This tells us that the second part of the conditional statement is true; the smonk is indeed in the 'plagged' state.\n\n3. Since we know that the smonk is in the 'plagged' state, and the conditional statement says that if it were vreebled, it would be plagged, we can infer that the smonk must have been vreebled at some point to satisfy the condition for being in the 'plagged' state.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can conclude that:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
