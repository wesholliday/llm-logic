It means that if event A (the dreb being vroombed) occurs, then event B (the dreb being spended) must also occur.\n\n2. \"The dreb was spened.\" This is a factual statement asserting that event B has occurred.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can apply the transitive property of logic to infer whether event A (the dreb being vroombed) also occurred. The transitive property states that if A implies B and B implies C, then A must imply C. In other words, if we have a chain of implications, then all links in the chain are true.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- If A (the dreb was vroombed), then B (the dreb was spended).\n- We know that B (the dreb was spended) is true.\n\nTherefore, by the transitive property, we can infer that A (the dreb was vroom",
