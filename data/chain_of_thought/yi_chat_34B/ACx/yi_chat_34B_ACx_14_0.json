It can be represented as A \u2192 B, where A is 'the clug was fleeked' and B is 'the clug snugged'.\n\n2. \"The clug snugged.\" This is a factual statement that tells us the event B (the clug snugged) occurred.\n\nNow, we are asked if we can infer 'The clug was fleeked' (A) from these two statements. In a conditional statement A \u2192 B, when B occurs, we cannot automatically conclude that A must have occurred without any additional information. The relationship established by the arrow (\u2192) is one-way: if A is true, then B must be true, but the reverse is not necessarily true.\n\nIn this case, we know that B (the clug snugged) is true, but we cannot definitively say that A (the clug was fleeked) is also true without further information.
