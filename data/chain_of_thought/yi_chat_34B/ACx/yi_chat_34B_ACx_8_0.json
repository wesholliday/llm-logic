We have a conditional statement: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\" This means that if the sprocket is cranked (the condition), it must also be daggled (the consequence).\n\n2. We are given that \"The sprocket was daggled.\" This tells us that at least one part of the conditional statement has been met: the sprocket is daggled.\n\n3. To infer 'The sprocket was cranked' from the information provided, we would need to establish that the condition (the sprocket being cranked) must have occurred in order for the consequence (the sprocket being daggled) to be true.\n\n4. However, the conditional statement does not specify that the daggling of the sprocket is a unique consequence of being cranked. It could be possible that there are other ways for the sprocket to become daggled without being cranked.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the information given and the conditional statement provided, we cannot definitively infer 'The sprocket was crank",
