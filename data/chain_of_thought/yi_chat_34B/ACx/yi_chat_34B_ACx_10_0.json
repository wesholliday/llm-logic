To do this, we need to consider the logical implications of Premise 1 and how it relates to Premise 2.\n\nPremise 1 is an example of a conditional statement in the form \"If A then B\" where A (the wug was sproinged) is the antecedent, and B (it was garpled) is the consequent. According to the rules of logic, if the consequent B is true, we cannot automatically conclude that the antecedent A is also true. This is because there are other ways for B to be true apart from A being true; in other words, there might be additional information or scenarios not provided that could lead to B being true without A being true.\n\nPremise 2 tells us that the wug was garpled,",
