We also know that \"The shank was nugged\" (N).\n3. To infer 'The shank was plooked' (P) from these two pieces of information, we would need to apply the rule of inference known as modus ponens, which states that if you have a conditional statement P \u2192 N and evidence for N, then you can conclude P.\n4. However, in this case, we only have evidence for N (the shank was nugged), but not for P (the shank was plooked).\n5. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer 'The shank was plooked' from 'If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged' and 'The shank was nugged' alone.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
