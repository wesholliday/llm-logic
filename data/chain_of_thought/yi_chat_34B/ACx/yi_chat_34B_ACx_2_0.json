We have two statements:\n   - If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint (conditional statement in symbolic form: WugFlooped \u2192 WugBimmedZoint).\n   - The wug bimmed the zoint (factual statement: WugBimmedZoint).\n\n2. According to the rules of logic, if a conditional statement is true and its conclusion is true, then we can infer that the antecedent (the part before the arrow) must also be true. This is known as modus ponens.\n\n3. In this case, since WugBimmedZoint is true (from the second statement), and WugFlooped \u2192 WugBimmedZoint is a valid logical relationship (if one thing implies another and we know that the thing implied is true, then we can conclude that the first thing must also be true), we can infer that WugFlooped must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
