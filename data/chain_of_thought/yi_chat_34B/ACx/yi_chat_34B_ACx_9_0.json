We have two statements:\n   - If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished (conditional statement in the form of an if-then proposition).\n   - The twonk was varnished (a factual statement).\n\n2. According to the rules of logic for conditional statements, if the second part of the conditional is true, then the first part must also be true. This is because a conditional statement is considered true unless we can find a case where the antecedent (the 'if' part) is true and the consequent (the 'then' part) is false.\n\n3. Since we know that the twonk was varnished, which is the second part of the conditional statement, it follows logically that the first part must also be true. The first part states that if the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the given information and the rules of logic, we can infer that the twonk was indeed plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by",
