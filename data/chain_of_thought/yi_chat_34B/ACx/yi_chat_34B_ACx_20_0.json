However, the first statement is a conditional \"if...then\" statement, which does not provide certainty about the truth of the condition when the outcome is observed. It only tells us what would happen if the condition were true.\n\nSince we do not have any additional information to confirm that the fleeg being surned necessarily implies that it was bluttered (for example, a third statement like \"Whenever the fleeg surns, it must have been bluttered\"), we cannot definitively infer 'The",
