The original statement is \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This is a conditional statement in logic, where 'A' represents \"the book was written by James\" and 'B' represents \"the book is a mystery novel.\" So, the statement can be represented as A \u2192 B (read as \"A implies B\").\n\n2. The proposed inference is \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James.\" This would be another conditional statement, where 'B' still represents \"the book is a mystery novel\" and 'C' represents an additional condition (e.g., \"the book was written by James\"). So, the proposed inference can be represented as B \u2192 C.\n\n3. To determine if we can infer B \u2192 C from A \u2192 B, we need to consider the logical relationship between the conditions. However, there is no direct logical connection between 'B' (the book being a mystery novel) and 'A' (the book being written by James) in the original statement. The original statement only",
