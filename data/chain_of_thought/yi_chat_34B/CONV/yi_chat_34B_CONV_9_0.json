Just because Mark bought the blue shirt does not necessarily mean that Lisa bought the red shirt. There could be other reasons for Mark to buy the blue shirt that do not involve Lisa buying the red shirt. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]",
