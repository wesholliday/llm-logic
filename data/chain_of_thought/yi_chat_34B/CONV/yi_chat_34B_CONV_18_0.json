This means that if condition A is true, then condition B must also be true. It does not necessarily mean that if B is true, then A must also be true.\n\nNow let's consider the proposed inference: 'If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic'. This would imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship between the material of the truck and the material of the doll, which is not necessarily implied by the original statement. The original statement only tells us that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal; it does not tell us anything about what happens when the truck is metal or the doll is not plastic.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal', we cannot logically infer 'If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic'. The two conditions (the doll being plastic and the truck being metal",
