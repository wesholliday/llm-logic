The original statement is \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where 'P' represents \"the griffin was in the forest\" and 'Q' represents \"the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\n2. The proposed inference is to reverse the order of the conditions and the conclusion, resulting in the new statement: \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was in the forest.\" This would be a conditional statement with 'P' now representing \"the unicorn was in the forest\" and 'Q' still representing \"the griffin was in the forest.\"\n\n3. To determine if this inference is valid, we need to consider the logical structure of the statements. In the original statement, 'P' (griffin in the forest) implies 'Q' (unicorn in the forest). However, just because 'P' implies 'Q' does not necessarily mean that 'Q' implies 'P'. This is",
