The statement is logically equivalent to \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the reverse implication: \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane.\" This would imply that whenever Erin takes a train, Sam must have taken a plane. However, there is no information provided to suggest that taking a train by Erin is always followed by Sam taking a plane. It is possible that Erin might take a train for one reason or another without Sam necessarily having taken a plane.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train,\" we cannot infer with certainty that \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane.\" The first statement does not guarantee the truth of the reverse implication.\n\nAnswer: no<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
