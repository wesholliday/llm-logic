This can be represented as A \u2192 B, where '\u2192' is the symbol for 'implies' or 'results in'.\n\nWe want to infer the reverse conditional: If B (the pants are denim), then A (the shirt is cotton). This would be represented as B \u2192 A.\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement A \u2192 B, it does not necessarily follow that B \u2192 A. The reason for this is that the arrow '\u2192' represents a one-way relationship. Just because wearing cotton shirts results in wearing denim pants (A \u2192 B) does not mean that wearing denim pants always results in wearing cotton shirts (B \u2192 A). There could be other factors at play, or the relationship could be reversed in certain circumstances.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot logically infer 'If the",
