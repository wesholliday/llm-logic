The reason for this is that a conditional statement is true when the antecedent (A) is false or when the consequent (B) is true. In other words, there are two possible scenarios:\n\n1. The car was not red, and thus the truck could be any color, including blue. This would make B \u2192 A false because we don't know that the car being red necessarily caused the truck to be blue.\n2. The car was red, which means the truck must have been blue (because A \u2192 B is true). However, this does not guarantee that if the truck were blue, the car would always be",
