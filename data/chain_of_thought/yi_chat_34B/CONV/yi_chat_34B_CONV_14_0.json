There are two possibilities:\n\n1. The first possibility is that the presence of the bear in the case necessitates the presence of the wolf in the den (and vice versa). In this scenario, A \u2192 B and B \u2192 A would be logically equivalent, and we could infer one from the other.\n\n2. The second possibility is that while A \u2192 B is true, the reverse implication B \u2192 A is not necessarily true. This means that the presence of the wolf in the den does not guarantee that",
