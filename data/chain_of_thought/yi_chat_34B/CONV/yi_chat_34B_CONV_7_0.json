In this context, we can say that if event A (Alex finishing the race) occurs, then event B (Chris finishing the race) must also occur.\n\nHowever, the proposed inference 'If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race' would be represented as B \u2192 A. This suggests that if event B (Chris finishing the race) occurs, then event A (Alex finishing the race) must also occur.\n\nThe issue with this inference is that it reverses the order of the conditions without any additional information to support such a reversal. There is no logical guarantee that just because Chris finished the race, Alex necessarily did as well. The original statement only tells us that if Alex's finishing the race is a prerequisite for Chris finishing the",
