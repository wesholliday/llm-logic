In other words, knowing that if A happens, B must happen (A \u2192 B) does not necessarily mean that if B happens, A must also happen.\n\nIn this case, without any additional information about the relationship between the color of the apple and the banana, we cannot infer a bidirectional relationship. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\"\n\nAnswer: no<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No, we cannot infer 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red' from the statement 'If the apple was red",
