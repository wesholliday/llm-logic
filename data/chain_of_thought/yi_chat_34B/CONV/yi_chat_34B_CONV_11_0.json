The original statement is \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This means that if the condition of the cake being chocolate is met, it implies that the muffins are blueberry.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the proposed inference. The proposed inference is \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate.\" This would imply that if we know the muffins are blueberry, it means the cake must have been chocolate.\n\nStep 3: Consider the logical relationship. There is a direct cause-and-effect relationship in the original statement: if the cake is chocolate, it causes the inference that the muffins are blueberry. However, the proposed inference is trying to reverse this logic, suggesting that knowing the muffins are blueberry would automatically mean the cake was chocolate.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the validity of the reversal. Logically, just because the muffins are blueberry does not necessarily mean that the cake was chocolate. There could be other reasons for the muffins to be blueberry, such as them being made from a different recipe or batch than the cake.\n\nStep 5:",
