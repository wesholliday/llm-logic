It can be represented as A \u2192 B, where A is 'the bear was in the cave' and B is 'the wolf was in the den'.\n\n2. \"The wolf was in the den.\" This is a factual statement that tells us B (the wolf being in the den) is true.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can logically deduce A (the bear being in the cave) from these two statements. According to the rules of logic:\n\n- If A \u2192 B and B are true, then A must also be true. This is because if the condition (A) is necessary for B to be true, and B is indeed true, then A must be true as well.\n\nHowever, in this case, we only know that B (the wolf being in the den) is true. We do not have any information about whether A (the bear being in the cave) is true or false. Therefore, based on the given information and the",
