We are given two statements:\n   - If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry (conditional statement in the form of an if-then statement).\n   - The muffins were blueberry (consequent of the conditional statement).\n\n2. According to the rules of logic for a conditional statement, if the consequent is true, we cannot conclude anything about the truth of the antecedent (in this case, whether the cake was chocolate) without additional information.\n\n3. The second statement tells us that the muffins were blueberry, which confirms the consequent of the first statement. However, it does not provide any information about the condition (whether the cake was chocolate).\n\n4. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot logically deduce whether the cake was chocolate or not.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
