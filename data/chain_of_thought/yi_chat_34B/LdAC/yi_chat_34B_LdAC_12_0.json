The first statement is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where 'P' represents \"Joe went to the park\" and 'Q' represents \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" This provides us with information about one part of the conditional statement (the 'Q' part) being true.\n\n3. We are asked if, from these two statements, we can logically deduce that \"Joe went to the park\" (which would mean that the 'P' part is also true).\n\nTo logically deduce 'Joe went to the park' from the given information, we would need to assume that the conditional statement is a true representation of reality and that when one part of the condition is met (Lucy going to the zoo), the other part must also be true (Joe going to the park).\n\nHowever, there is no guarantee that this is the case. The first statement could be describing a situation where if Joe goes to the",
