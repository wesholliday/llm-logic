However, in this case, we only know that B is true (Jen watched basketball), but we do not have any information about whether A is true or false. Therefore, based on the given information alone, we cannot logically deduce \"Tom watched football\" (A).\n\nAnswer: no<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response. Thank you for your question.
