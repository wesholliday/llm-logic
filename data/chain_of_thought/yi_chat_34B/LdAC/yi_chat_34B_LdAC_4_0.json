However, this is only valid if the conditional statement is a logical implication and not just a mere contingency.\n\nSince we have no additional information to suggest that the alien visiting Mars is somehow independent of the robot visiting Jupiter or that there are any other conditions that would make the two events unrelated, we can assume that the original conditional statement is a strong one, meaning that if B is true, then A must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical deduction from the conditional statement and the fact that the robot",
