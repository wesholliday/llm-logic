This is because the conditional statement is assumed to be true (if A, then B), and when B is true, it logically follows that A must also be true for the conditional to hold.\n\nStep 4: Applying this logic to our two statements, since we know \"The book is a mystery novel\" (B is true), it follows that \"The book was written by James\" (A must also be true).\n\nAnswer: Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step 1:",
