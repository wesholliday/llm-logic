We have a conditional statement: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This is represented as A \u2192 C, where A stands for 'Alex finished the race' and C stands for 'Chris finished the race'.\n\n2. We also know that Chris did indeed finish the race (C is true).\n\nNow, we want to determine if Alex finished the race (A) based on these two pieces of information. However, knowing that Chris finished the race does not necessarily mean that Alex did as well, because the conditional statement only tells us what would happen if A were true\u2014it does not guarantee that A is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot logically deduce that Alex finished the race. The best we can say is that it is possible for both Alex and Chris to have finished the race, but without additional information about Alex's completion of the race, we cannot conclude that Alex did finish it.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RE",
