            "content": "[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1. We have a conditional statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" (let's call this A).\n2. We also know that the mummy was awake (let's call this B).\n3. To logically deduce 'The vampire was awake' (let's call this C) from A and B, we need to use the transitive property of implication in logic. This states that if A implies B, and B implies C, then A implies C.\n4. We are given B (the mummy was awake), which is one part of the conditional statement A.\n5. If we can conclude that A (the vampire being awake implies the mummy being awake) is true, then by the transitive property, we should be able to deduce C (the vampire was awake) from B (the mummy was awake).\n\nExplanation:\nThe conditional statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' tells us that if A (vampire being awake) is true, then B (mummy being awake) must also be true. Since we know B to be true",
