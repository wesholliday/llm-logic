However, the statement only tells us that if the car were red, then the truck would be blue; it does not guarantee that the car actually is red.\n\nStep 4: Since we do not have any additional information about the car's color, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The car was red\" based solely on the fact that \"The truck was blue.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the logical deduction process, we cannot logically deduce that 'The car was red' from the given statements.<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: no<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Explanation: The statement \"If the car was red",
