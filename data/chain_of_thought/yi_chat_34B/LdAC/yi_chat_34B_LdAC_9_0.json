            "content": "[RESP]Let's analyze the given statements step by step:\n\n1. The first statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This is an implication, which in symbolic logic can be represented as A \u2192 B, where A is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and B is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This is a factual statement that tells us B (Mark buying the blue shirt) is true.\n\n3. We are asked to determine if we can logically deduce A (Lisa buying the red shirt) from these two statements.\n\nTo logically deduce A from the given information, we would need to use the contrapositive of the first statement, which is \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" This is symbolically represented as \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA.\n\nHowever, since we know B (Mark buying the blue shirt) is true, we cannot directly deduce A (Lisa buying the red shirt) from the information provided. The first statement tells us only that if B were false, then A would also be false",
