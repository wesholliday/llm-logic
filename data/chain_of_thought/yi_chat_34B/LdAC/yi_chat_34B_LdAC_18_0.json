However, it does not specify what happens if A is false; B could still be true or false in that case.\n\n2. \"The truck was metal.\" This is a factual statement asserting that one of the conditions (B) is indeed true.\n\nNow, we need to consider two possibilities:\n\n- If the doll *was* plastic, then by the conditional statement, the truck would be metal, which matches our second fact. In this case, we can deduce that the doll was plastic because the condition (A) leads to a known consequence (B) that is true.\n\n- However, if the doll *was not* plastic, then the conditional statement does not specify what happens to the truth value of B (the truck being metal).
