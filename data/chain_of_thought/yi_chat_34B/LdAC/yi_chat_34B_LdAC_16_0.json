If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim (conditional statement in the form of an implication: A -> B).\n2. The pants were denim (fact: B is true).\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, if the consequent (B) is true, and we have a valid implication (A -> B), then we can conclude that the antecedent (A) must also be true. This is known as the \"modus ponens\" rule or the \"law of detachment\".\n\nTherefore, since we know that the pants were denim (B is true) and that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants would be denim (A -> B), we can logically deduce that the shirt was indeed cotton (A is true).\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[THINK]To determine if we can logically deduce that the shirt was cotton given that the pants were denim, let's break down the information provided:\n\n1.
