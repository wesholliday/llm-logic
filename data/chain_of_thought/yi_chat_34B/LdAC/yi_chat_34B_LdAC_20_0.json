The first statement is \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"if P, then Q,\" where 'P' represents \"the apple was red\" and 'Q' represents \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"The banana was yellow.\" This provides us with evidence that the condition 'Q' (the banana being yellow) is true.\n\n3. In a conditional statement, if both the antecedent ('P') and the consequent ('Q') are true, then we can conclude that the original conditional statement is true. However, in this case, we only know that 'Q' is true; we do not have information about whether 'P' (the apple being red) is also true.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot logically deduce that the apple was red. We can only conclude that if the apple *were* red, then the banana would be yellow, but since we don't know the",
