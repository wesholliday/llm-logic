            "content": "\nStep by Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The statement \"Sue must have chosen pizza\" is negated with \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\"\n2. When a statement is negated, it means the opposite of the original statement is true.\n3. Therefore, if \"Sue must have chosen pizza\" is negated and the result is given to us as true, then the original statement (that Sue must have chosen pizza) is false.\n4. A negation does not directly imply the opposite possibility; it only states that the original claim is false.\n5. However, since we know \"Sue must have chosen pizza\" is false, it means that Sue could have chosen something else or might not have made a choice at all.\n6. Therefore, based on the negation of the statement, we can infer that Sue might not have chosen pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
