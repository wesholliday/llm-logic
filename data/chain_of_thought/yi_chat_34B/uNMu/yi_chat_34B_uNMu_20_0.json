The statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag\" suggests that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not in her bag. This means that while they may be in her bag, there is no certainty or necessity for them to be there. Therefore, we can infer that the sunglasses might not be in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
