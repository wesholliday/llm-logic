In this context, the negation applies to the idea that the griffin must have been in the forest. Since the statement denies the necessity of the griffin being in the forest, it suggests that there are other possibilities.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the griffin might not have been in the forest.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Yes<|im_end|><|im_end|>\n",
