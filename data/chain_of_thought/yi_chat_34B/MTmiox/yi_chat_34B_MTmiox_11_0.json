It leaves open the possibility that the flug could have been zimmed or not.\n\n2. \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed.\" This is a conditional statement that tells us if the flug was blummed (under this condition), then it necessarily follows that the flug was also zimmed.\n\nNow, let's try to infer from these two statements whether we can conclude \"The flug was not blummed.\"\n\nBased on the first statement alone, we cannot determine with certainty whether the flug was zimmed or not. However, if we combine this with the second statement, we have a potential contradiction: If being blummed necessarily implies being zimmed, and we already know that the flug might not have been zimmed, then it seems to suggest that the flug cannot be both blummed and not zim",
