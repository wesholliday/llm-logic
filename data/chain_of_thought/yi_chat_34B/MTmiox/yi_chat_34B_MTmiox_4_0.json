It leaves open the possibility that the fribble could have crinked or not crinked.\n\n2. \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked.\" This is a conditional statement that establishes a necessary connection between two events: if the fribble was snurgled, it would necessarily have crinked as well.\n\nNow, let's try to infer from these statements whether \"The fribble was not snurgled.\"\n\nGiven that we know the fribble might not have crinked (which is consistent with both possibilities: being snurgled and not crinkling, or not being snurgled and not crinkling), and given that if the fribble was snurgled, it would have crinked, we can conclude that since the fribble might not have crinked, it must",
