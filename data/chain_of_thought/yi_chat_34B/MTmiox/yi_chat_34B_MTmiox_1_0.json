It leaves open the possibility that the flugel could have been zargled or not.\n\n2. \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled.\" This is a conditional statement that establishes a necessary relationship between being blimmed and being zargled. If a flugel is blimmed, it must also be zargled.\n\nNow, let's try to infer whether \"The flugel was not blimmed\" from these two statements:\n\n- If we know that the flugel might not have been zargled (which is a possibility), and if being blimmed necessarily implies being zargled, then it stands to reason that if the flugel was not zargled, it also could not have been blimmed.\n\n- However, we cannot be certain that the flugel was not zarg",
