It implies that the state of the fleeg with respect to its orientation could be unchanged or unknown.\n\n2. \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\" This is a conditional statement that tells us if the fleeg was subjected to a bluttering action (whatever that may be), then it necessarily followed that it was also turned, or surned.\n\nNow, let's consider what we can infer from these two statements:\n\n- If the fleeg was not surned, as suggested in the first statement, then according to the second statement, the fleeg could not have been bluttered because if it had been bluttered, it would have necessarily been surned.\n\n- Since we are told that the fleeg might not have been surned (which is different from saying \"The fleeg was definitely not surned\"), there is a possibility that the fleeg was neither turned nor bluttered, or perhaps only",
