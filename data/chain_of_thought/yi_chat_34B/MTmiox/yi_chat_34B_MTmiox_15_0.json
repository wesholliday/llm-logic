It does not necessarily mean that the dreb definitely wasn't spent, but there is a possibility.\n\n2. \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spended.\" This is a conditional statement that tells us if the dreb was used in a certain way (vroombed), then it must have been spent or used up.\n\nNow, let's consider what we can infer from these two statements:\n\n- If the dreb was not spent, as suggested by the first statement, then it could not have been vroomed, because if it had been vroomed, it would have to have been spent (according to the second statement).\n\n- Since we cannot determine whether the dreb was definitely not spent based on the first statement alone, we also cannot definitively say that the dreb was not vroomed. We can only conclude that if the dreb was indeed not spent, then it could not have been vroom",
