It does not necessarily mean that the flob definitely did not move, but there is a possibility that it remained still.\n\n2. \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated.\" This is a conditional statement where being 'skizzled' is a condition for the flob to have moved ('movated'). It implies that if the flob shows signs of being 'skizzled,' we can conclude with certainty that it moved.\n\nNow, let's consider what we can infer from these two statements:\n\n- If the flob was not skizzled (the condition did not occur), then according to the second statement, we cannot determine whether the flob movated or not. The lack of 'skizzling' does not necessarily mean that the flob remained still; it could have moved without showing signs of being 'skizzled.'\n\n- If the flob was skizzled (the condition occurred), then according to the second",
