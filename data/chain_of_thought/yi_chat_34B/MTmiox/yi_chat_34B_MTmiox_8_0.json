It leaves open the possibility that the sprocket could have been daggled or not.\n\n2. \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled.\" This is a conditional statement that establishes a necessary relationship between two events: if the sprocket was cranked, it necessarily follows that it was also daggled.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements to see if we can infer anything about whether the sprocket was cranked or not:\n\n- If the sprocket might not have been daggled (which is possible), and\n- If being cranked necessarily implies that the sprocket was also daggled,\n\nthen it suggests that if the sprocket was indeed cranked, we would be contradicting the possibility that it might not have been daggled. However, since the first statement uses \"might\" which",
