It does not confirm whether it was or wasn't, but leaves open the possibility that it may not have been.\n\n2. \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged.\" This is a conditional statement that establishes a necessary relationship between two actions. If the shank was plooked (action A), then it necessarily follows that the shank was also nugged (action B).\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- We know that the shank might not have been nugged (not B).\n- If the shank was plooked (A), then it must have been nugged (B).\n\nSince we are given that the shank might not have been nugged (not B), and we know that if it were plooked (A), it would necessarily be nug",
