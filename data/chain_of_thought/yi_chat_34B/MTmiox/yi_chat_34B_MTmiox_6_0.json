It leaves open the possibility that the grommet could still have been involved.\n\n2. \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink.\" This is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between being sploffed and plopping the frink. If one condition (being sploffed) is true, then the other (plopping the frink) must also be true.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot directly infer \"The grommet was not sploffed\" because the first statement only suggests that it might not have plopped the frink, which does not necessarily mean it wasn't sploffed. The second statement tells us what would happen if it were sploffed, but it doesn't provide information about whether or not it actually was sploffed.\n\nTherefore, based on",
