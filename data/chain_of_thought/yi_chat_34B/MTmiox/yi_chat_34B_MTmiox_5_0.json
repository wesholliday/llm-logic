It could also be interpreted as a statement of uncertainty\u2014we are not sure whether the zinger was smoogled or not.\n\n2. \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger must have been smoogled.\" This is a conditional statement: if A (the zinger being fraggled) occurs, then B (the zinger being smoogled) must also occur. It does not tell us whether A or B actually occurred; it only establishes a relationship between them.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively infer that \"The zinger was not fraggled.\" The first statement allows for the possibility that the zinger was not smoogled, but it does not rule out the possibility that it was fraggled. The second statement tells us what would be true if the zinger were fraggled, but it does not provide any information about whether the zinger actually was fraggled or",
