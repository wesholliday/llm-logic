This is because the condition (being shripped) is not met, so the consequence (lupping the zoint) does not necessarily follow.\n\n- However, the first statement tells us that it's possible the smip did not lup the zoint. Since we are considering a scenario where the smip was not shripped, and in that case, the smip would not have lupped the zoint,",
