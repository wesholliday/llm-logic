In other words, does a metal truck necessarily mean that the doll is plastic?\n\nTo determine this, we need to consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. If the doll is plastic and the truck is metal, then the original statement holds true (A \u2192 B).\n2. However, if the doll is not plastic (A is false) but the truck is still metal (B is true), then the original statement is true because the condition A being true is not necessary for B to be true. In this case, we cannot infer that a metal truck implies a plastic doll.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot conclude that if the truck",
