            "content": "[THINK]\nTo answer this question, let's consider the given statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This is a conditional statement where Mary being at the wedding is the condition for Sue to be at the wedding. It suggests that whenever Mary attends the wedding, Sue also attends.\n\nNow, we are asked if we can infer the reverse: \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\" This would imply that whenever Sue attends the wedding, Mary must have attended as well.\n\nLet's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. If Mary is at the wedding, then Sue is also at the wedding (given).\n2. The question asks if, when Sue is at the wedding, we can conclude that Mary is also there.\n\nThe key here is to consider whether the presence of Sue at the wedding guarantees or implies the presence of Mary. If the presence of Sue always implies the presence of Mary, then we could infer the reverse statement as true. However, the given information does not necessarily establish such a relationship. It only tells us that if Mary is there, then so is Sue, but it does not tell us that if",
