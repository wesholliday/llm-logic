The statement can be written as A \u2192 B, which means if A (vampire awake) is true, then B (mummy awake) must also be true.\n\nNow, we are asked to infer whether \"if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake\" is true or not. This would be represented by B \u2192 A.\n\nTo determine if B \u2192 A is true, we need to consider the possible states of being for the vampire and the mummy:\n\n1. Both the vampire and the mummy are awake (A and B are both true).\n2. The vampire is awake, but the mummy is not (A is true, B is false).\n3. The mummy is awake, but the vampire is not (A is false, B is true).\n4. Both the vampire and the mummy are asleep (A and B are both false).\n\nAccording to the given statement A \u2192 B,",
