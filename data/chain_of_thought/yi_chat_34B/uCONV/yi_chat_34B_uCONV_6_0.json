The statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" tells us that whenever Sue chooses pizza, Bob also chooses pasta. This is a conditional statement where Sue's choice of pizza is the condition (or hypothesis) and Bob's choice of pasta is the consequence (or conclusion).\n\n2. We are asked to infer whether if Bob chose pasta, then Sue must have chosen pizza. In other words, we are looking for the converse of the original statement: \"If Bob chooses pasta, then Sue chooses pizza.\"\n\n3. The converse of a conditional statement is formed by switching the antecedent (the part before the 'if') with the consequent (the part after the 'then'). However, when we do this, we need to be cautious because in general, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true.\n\n4. In this case, even if Bob did choose pasta, it does not necessarily mean that Sue chose pizza. It's possible that someone else (not Sue) choosing pizza could",
