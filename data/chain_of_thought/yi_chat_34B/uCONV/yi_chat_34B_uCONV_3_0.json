We are asking if we can infer that if the book is a mystery novel, then it was written by James.\n\nTo determine if we can infer this, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. If we know that if the book is a mystery novel, does that necessarily mean that James wrote it? The answer is no, because there could be other authors who write mystery novels as well. Just because a book fits one condition (being a mystery novel) does not automatically imply that it was written by James.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the book is a mystery novel, then it was written by James.<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: no<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Explanation: The statement \"If the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel\" tells us that if James wrote the book, it must be a mystery novel. However, it does not tell us that all mystery novels were written by James. There could be other authors who write mystery novels as well. Therefore,",
