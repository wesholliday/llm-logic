If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. (Statement A)\n2. The muffins were blueberry. (Assumed for the purpose of this inference)\n\nBased on Statement A, if we know that the muffins were blueberry, we can conclude that the cake must have been chocolate. However, the second statement is what we are inferring from the first:\n\n3. If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate. (Inferred Statement B)\n\nThe logical structure of these statements is such that if A implies B, and we know B to be true, then we can conclude that A must also be true. In this case, knowing that the muffins were blueberry (B being true) means that the cake was chocolate (A must also be true).\n\nTherefore, based on our initial assumption that the muffins were blueberry, we can infer that the cake was indeed chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[THINK]\nTo determine if a triangle is equilateral given that it has three equal sides",
