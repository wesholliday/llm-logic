It leaves open the possibility that they could be denim or some other material.\n\n2. \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\" This is a conditional statement: if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are necessarily denim. However, this does not tell us anything about what happens if the pants are not denim; it only establishes a relationship between the shirt being cotton and the pants being denim.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot directly infer that the shirt was not cotton because the first statement allows for the possibility that the pants could be something other than denim, but it does not necessarily mean that the shirt is not cotton. The second statement only tells us what would be true if the shirt were cotton, not what is true when the pants are not denim.\n\nTherefore, based on these two statements alone, we cannot conclude with certainty that the shirt was not cotton.
