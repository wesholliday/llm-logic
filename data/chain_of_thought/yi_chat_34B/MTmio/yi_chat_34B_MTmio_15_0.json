It does not necessarily mean that she definitely didn't take a train, but it leaves open the possibility that she may have traveled by another mode of transportation or not at all.\n\n2. \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train\" is a conditional statement where the implication is that if Sam took a plane, then Erin's mode of transport would be constrained to taking a train. This does not tell us anything about what actually happened; it only establishes a condition for Erin's travel if Sam did indeed take a plane.\n\nGiven these two statements alone, we cannot infer with certainty whether Sam took a plane or not. The first statement leaves open the possibility that Erin may not have traveled at all, and without knowing Erin's mode of transport, we cannot definitively say that Sam did not take a plane. There is no direct link between Erin's potential train travel and Sam's possible plane travel; they are independent statements about each person's transportation options.\n\nTherefore, based on",
