It does not provide definitive information about whether she was or wasn't there.\n\n2. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" is a conditional statement where the presence of Mary at the wedding is a necessary condition for Sue to be there as well. This means that if Mary was present, Sue would necessarily have been too. However, this does not tell us anything about what happens when Mary is not at the wedding.\n\n3. To infer \"Mary was not at the wedding\" from the given information, we would need additional knowledge or a premise that states something like \"If Sue is not at the wedding, then Mary must not have been there either.\" Without such a premise, we cannot directly conclude that Mary was not at the wedding just because Sue might not have been there.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer with certainty that \"Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP",
