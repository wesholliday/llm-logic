It does not provide any definitive information about what flavor they were, only that blueberry is not a certain possibility.\n\n2. \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\" This is a conditional statement where the presence of chocolate cake implies the presence of blueberry muffins. It does not specify whether the cake is actually chocolate or not; it only establishes a necessary condition for the muffin flavor if the cake were indeed chocolate.\n\n3. We are asked to infer \"The cake was not chocolate\" from the previous two statements. However, the first statement does not provide enough information to determine the actual flavor of the muffins, and the second statement only tells us what would be true *if* the cake were chocolate. It does not tell us anything about the cake's actual flavor when combined with the possibility that the muffins might not have been blueberry.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot logically infer that \"The cake was not",
