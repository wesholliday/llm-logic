It leaves open the possibility that the wolf could have been in the den or elsewhere.\n\n2. \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\" This statement establishes a condition: if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf's location is determined to be in the den. However, this does not tell us anything about what happens if the bear is not in the cave.\n\nNow, let's try to infer whether \"The bear was not in the cave\" from these two statements:\n\n- If we assume that the wolf was not in the den (as suggested by the first statement), then according to the second statement, this would imply that the bear cannot be in the cave because if it were, the wolf would have to be in the den.\n\n- However, the first statement only says \"might not\" have been in the den, which means it's possible but not",
