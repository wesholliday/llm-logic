It does not necessarily mean that the mummy was definitely not awake, but there is a possibility.\n\n2. \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\" This is an implication statement. It tells us that if one condition (the vampire being awake) is true, then another condition (the mummy being awake) must also be true. However, this does not tell us whether either of these conditions are actually true or false.\n\nNow, let's try to infer something from these two statements:\n\n- If the mummy might not have been awake, and if being awake for the vampire implies that the mummy is awake, then we can conclude that it is possible for the mummy to be asleep while the vampire is awake. This does not contradict the original statement about the mummy possibly not being awake because it only says \"might not\" have been awake, which allows for both possibilities (awake and asleep).\n\nTherefore, based on the information",
