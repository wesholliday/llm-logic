This statement alone does not provide definitive information about what Kate ate or didn't eat. It only indicates a possibility.\n\n2. \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad\" is a conditional statement where the consumption of pasta by Ben (the if part) is a necessary condition for Kate to have eaten salad (the then part). This means that if we know Ben ate pasta, we can conclude with certainty that Kate ate salad because the statement guarantees it.\n\n3. However, the first statement tells us only that it's possible Kate didn't eat salad, not that she definitely did not. Since the second statement is conditional on Ben eating pasta, and we don't have information about whether Ben ate pasta or not, we cannot directly infer from the first statement alone that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\n4. To infer that Ben did not eat pasta, we would need to know for certain that Kate did not",
