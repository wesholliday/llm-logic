            "content": "\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. The statement \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt\" implies that it is possible that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n2. The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement where buying the red shirt by Lisa is the condition for Mark to buy the blue shirt.\n3. Since we are given that \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt,\" which means it's possible, there are two possibilities: either Lisa did not buy the red shirt, or Lisa bought the red shirt and thus Mark bought the blue shirt (contradicting our initial assumption).\n4. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then we would have a contradiction because that would mean Mark must have bought the blue shirt, which we already assumed might not have happened.\n5. Therefore, to avoid a contradiction, we must conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
