It does not necessarily mean that the banana was not yellow, but it leaves open the possibility of another color.\n\n2. \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" This is a conditional statement where being red (the condition) implies that the banana would be yellow. However, this does not tell us anything about what happens if the condition (apple being red) is not met. It only tells us what to expect if the apple *is* red.\n\nNow, let's consider the question at hand: \"From 'The banana might not have been yellow' together with 'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow', can we infer 'The apple was not red'?\"\n\nBased on our analysis of the two statements above, we cannot directly infer that \"The apple was not red\" just from the information provided. The first statement does not confirm that the banana was not yellow, and the second statement only tells us what would be true",
