It does not necessarily mean that Chris definitely did not finish the race, but there is a possibility.\n\n2. \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\" This is an implication statement. It tells us that if Alex finished the race, which is one condition, then another condition (Chris finishing the race) must also be true. However, this does not tell us anything about what happens if Alex *doesn't* finish the race.\n\nNow, let's try to infer something from these two statements:\n\n- If Chris might not have finished the race, and we know that if Alex finishes the race, then Chris must also finish it, then we can conclude that since there is a possibility that Chris did not finish the race, Alex cannot be the one who caused Chris to finish the race. In other words, Alex's finishing the race does not guarantee that Chris finished as well, because Chris might not have finished regardless of whether Alex did or not.\n\n- Therefore, we",
