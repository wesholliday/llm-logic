It leaves open the possibility that the cat could have been inside or outside.\n\n2. \"If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\" This is a conditional statement where the presence of the dog inside implies the absence of the cat inside (because if both were inside, it would not satisfy the condition). However, this does not mean that the dog being inside is the only possibility for the cat to be outside; there could be other reasons for the cat to be outside while the dog is inside or elsewhere.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively infer \"The dog was not inside\" because the first statement allows for the possibility that the cat might have been inside without the dog being present. The second statement only establishes a necessary condition for the presence of the cat outside, but it does not preclude the possibility of the dog being inside under other circumstances.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot conclude with certainty that \"The dog was",
