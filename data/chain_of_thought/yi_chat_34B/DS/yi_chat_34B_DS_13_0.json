The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf\" tells us that there are only two possible locations for the toy: in the toy box or on the shelf.\n2. We are given the additional information that \"The toy isn't sitting on the shelf,\" which eliminates one of the two possibilities mentioned in the first statement.\n3. Since the toy is not on the shelf (as per the second statement) and there are only two possible locations for it, we can conclude that the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
