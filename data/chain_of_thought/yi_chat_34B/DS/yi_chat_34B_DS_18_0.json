The statement \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand\" tells us that there are only two possible locations for the notebook: either in the drawer or on the nightstand.\n2. We are given the additional information that \"The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand,\" which eliminates one of the two possibilities mentioned in the first statement.\n3. Since both statements cannot be true simultaneously (a notebook cannot be both in the drawer and on the nightstand), we must conclude that if the second statement is true (the notebook is not on the nightstand), then the only remaining possibility is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
