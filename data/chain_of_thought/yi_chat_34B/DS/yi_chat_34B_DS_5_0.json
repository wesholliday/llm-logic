The statement \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry\" is a logical disjunction, meaning that one of two possibilities must be true.\n2. We are given that \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry\" which means that the second part of the disjunction (the cookies being hidden in the pantry) is false.\n3. If the second part is false, then according to the law of excluded middle (which states that in a logical proposition, either one side must be true or the other), the first part of the disjunction must be true.\n4. Therefore, since we have established that both parts of the disjunction cannot be false, and we know that the second part is false, we can conclude that the first part (\"The cookies are in the jar\") must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
