The statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table\" tells us that there are only two possible locations for the book: on the shelf or on the table.\n2. We are given the additional information that \"The book isn't resting on the table.\" This means one of two things must be true: either the book is on the shelf, or it is not in either location (which would be a contradiction since we were told only those two possibilities exist).\n3. Since a contradiction is unlikely, the most logical conclusion is that if the book is not resting on the table, then it must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
