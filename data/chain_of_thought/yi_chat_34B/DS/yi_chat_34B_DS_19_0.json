The statement \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist\" presents two possibilities for the location of the watch.\n2. We are given that \"The watch isn't on his wrist,\" which eliminates one of the two possibilities presented in the first statement.\n3. Since both possibilities cannot be true at the same time (a logical law of excluded middle), if one is false, the other must be true.\n4. Therefore, since we have established that the watch is not on his wrist, it must be charging on the dresser, as there are no other options given in the information provided.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
