The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet\" is a logical disjunction, meaning that one of two possibilities must be true.\n2. We are given that \"The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet\" which means that the second possibility is false.\n3. Since only one of the two possibilities can be true at any time (due to the law of excluded middle), if the second possibility is false, then the first possibility must be true by default.\n4. Therefore, we can infer from the given information that \"The keys are in the drawer\" because it's the only remaining option after ruling out the other possibility.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
