The statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they are perched on her head\" tells us that there are two possible locations for the sunglasses: in the bag or on the head.\n2. We are given the additional information that \"The sunglasses aren't perched on her head,\" which eliminates one of the two possibilities mentioned in the first statement.\n3. Since both options cannot be true (they can't be in the bag and on the head at the same time), if one option is false (not perched on the head), then the other option must be true by default.\n4. Therefore, we can infer from the available information that \"The sunglasses are in her bag\" because it is the only remaining possibility consistent with both statements.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
