This is because the second statement gives us two options for the state of the flob, and since one option (movated) has been eliminated by the first statement, the only remaining option is 'skizzled.'\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response. Thank you for your question. If you have any further questions or need assistance with anything else, please let me know!<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Thank you for using",
