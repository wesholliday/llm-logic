Since we already know from statement 1 that the grommet is not plopped, this means that the second alternative must be true.\n\n3. Therefore, based on the information provided by statements 1 and 2, we can infer that \"The grommet is sploffed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>",
