Therefore, based on these two statements together, we can infer:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>",
