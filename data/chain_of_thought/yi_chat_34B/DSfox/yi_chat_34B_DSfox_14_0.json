In this case, the proposition is that the clug is either snugged or fleeked. Since we already know from statement 1 that the clug is not snugged, according to the excluded middle, the only remaining possibility is that it must be fleeked.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the logical principle of the excluded middle, we can infer:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response. Thank you for your question. If you have any further questions or need assistance with anything else, please let me know!<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
