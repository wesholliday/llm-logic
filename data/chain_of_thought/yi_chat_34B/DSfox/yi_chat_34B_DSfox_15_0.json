It still exists and has not been depleted.\n\n2. \"Either the dreb is spended or it is vroombed.\" This is a logical statement that tells us that one of two things must be true: either the dreb has been spent, or it has been vroombed. Since we already know from the first statement that the dreb is not spent, this means that the only remaining possibility is that it has been vroombed.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: yes",
