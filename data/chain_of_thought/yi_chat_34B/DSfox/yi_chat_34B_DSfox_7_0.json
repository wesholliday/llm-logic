In this case, the proposition is \"The whiffle is tinked,\" and its negation is \"The whiffle is not tinked.\" Since we know from statement 1 that \"The whiffle is not tinked\" is true, according to the excluded middle, \"The whiffle is tinked\" must be false.\n\n3. If \"The whiffle is tinked\" is false and we are told that either it is tinked or shanked, then by process of elimination, the only remaining possibility is that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n",
