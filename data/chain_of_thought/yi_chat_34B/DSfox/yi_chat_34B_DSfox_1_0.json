In this case, the proposition is that the flugel is zargled or blimmed. Since we already know from statement 1 that the flugel is not zargled, this means that the only remaining possibility for the flugel is to be blimmed.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided by both statements together, we can infer:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response. Thank you for your question. If you have any further questions or need assistance with anything else, please let me know!<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
