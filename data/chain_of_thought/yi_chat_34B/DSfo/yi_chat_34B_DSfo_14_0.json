We are given two statements:\n   - \"The milk isn't chilling in the fridge.\"\n   - \"Either the milk is chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter.\"\n\n2. The first statement tells us that the milk is not in the fridge, which means one of two things must be true:\n   - The milk is on the counter (as per the second statement), or\n   - There is some other location where the milk could be (which we are not told about).\n\n3. Since we are not given any information about another possible location for the milk, we can conclude that the only option left is:\n   - The milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
