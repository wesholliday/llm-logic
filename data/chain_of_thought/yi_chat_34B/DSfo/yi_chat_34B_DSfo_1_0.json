We know that \"Fido is not in the garden.\" This means that Fido cannot be found in the garden.\n2. The second statement tells us that \"Either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside.\" This is a logical disjunction, meaning that one of two possibilities must be true: either Fido is in the garden, or Fido is inside (but not both).\n3.
