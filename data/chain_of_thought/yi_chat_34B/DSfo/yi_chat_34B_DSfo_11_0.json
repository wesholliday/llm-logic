Since we already know from the first statement that it's not on the porch, this second statement implies that if it's not on the porch, then it must be in the driveway.\n\nBased on these two statements together, we can indeed infer that \"The newspaper is in the driveway.\"<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
