It stands out or is not present on the floor.\n\n2. \"Either the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\"\n   This statement presents two possibilities for the location of the missing puzzle piece: it could be blending in on the floor (which we already know isn't true), or it could be in the box.\n\nNow, since the first statement tells us that the puzzle piece is not on the floor, and the second statement gives us only two options for its location (on the floor or in the box), we can logically conclude that if it's not on the floor, it must be in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Yes<|im_end|>\n",
