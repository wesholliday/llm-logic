The statement \"The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand\" tells us that the notebook is not in a specific location, which is on the nightstand.\n2. The statement \"Either the notebook is sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer\" presents two possibilities for the location of the notebook: on the nightstand or in the drawer.\n3.
