The second statement, \"Either the watch is on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser,\" presents two possible locations for the watch: on the person's wrist or on the dresser.\n3. Since we know from the first statement that the watch is not on the person's wrist, the only remaining possibility is that it must be somewhere else, specifically on the dresser, as per the second statement.\n4. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that \"The watch is charging on the dresser.\"<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
