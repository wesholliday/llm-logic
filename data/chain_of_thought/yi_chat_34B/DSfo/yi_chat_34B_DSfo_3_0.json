The statement \"The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet\" tells us that the keys are not in a certain location (the cabinet) and are not in a specific state (dangling).\n2. The statement \"Either the keys are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer\" presents two possible locations for the keys: the cabinet or the drawer.\n3.
