To do this, we need to consider the possibilities:\n\n- If the sprocket was not daggled (as per statement 1) and being cranked would necessarily mean it was daggled (statement 2), then the only way for both of these to be true is if the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The sprocket was not cranked\" from the given statements.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Yes<|im_end|><|im_end|>\n",
