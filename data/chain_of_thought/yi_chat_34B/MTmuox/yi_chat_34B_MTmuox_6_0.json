In other words, there are other possibilities regarding how the frink was affected by the grommet.\n\n2. \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink.\" This is a conditional statement: if A (the grommet being sploffed) occurs, then B (the grommet plopping the frink) must also occur.\n\nNow, we are asked to infer whether \"The grommet was not sploffed\" can be concluded from these two statements. To make this inference, we would need to know that A (sploffing) did not occur, because if it did occur, then B (plopping the frink) would also have to occur according to the second statement. However, since the first statement only tells us that A is not necessary for B to happen, it does not necessarily",
