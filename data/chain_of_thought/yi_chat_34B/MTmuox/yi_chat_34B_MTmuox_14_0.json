In other words, there is a possibility that the clug was not snugged.\n\n2. \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged.\" This is an implication statement: if A (the clug being fleeked) then B (the clug must have been snugged). It means that whenever A is true, B must also be true. However, it does not tell us whether A (clug being fleeked) is actually true or false.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot directly infer the truth value of \"The clug was not fleeked\" because we do not have enough information to determine whether the condition in statement 2 (the clug being fleeked) is met or not. We only know that it's not necessarily true that the clug must have been snugged, but we don't know for sure if the clug",
