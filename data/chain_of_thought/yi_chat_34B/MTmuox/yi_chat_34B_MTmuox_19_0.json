In other words, it is possible for the smonk not to have plagged.\n\n2. \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged.\" This is an implication statement: if A (vreebled) then B (plagged). It means that whenever A is true, B must also be true. However, it does not tell us whether A (vreebling) is true or false in this context.\n\nNow, to infer \"The smonk was not vreebled\" from the given statements, we would need additional information: whether the smonk actually did plag or not. If we know that the smonk did not plag, then we can conclude that A (vreebling) cannot be true because if it were, B (plagging) would have to be true as well, which contradicts our initial statement that \"It's not",
