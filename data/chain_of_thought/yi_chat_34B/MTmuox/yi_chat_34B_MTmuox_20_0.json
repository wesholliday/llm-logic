In other words, it is possible for the fleeg to exist without being surned.\n\n2. \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned\" is an implication that if the fleeg were to be in a state of being bluttered, it would necessarily also be in a state of being surned.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can consider the following possibilities:\n\n- If the fleeg was not bluttered (which is consistent with statement 1), then it could be in any state regarding being surned - possibly surned or not surned.\n\n- However, if the fleeg was bluttered (which contradicts statement 1), then according to statement 2, it must also have been surned. But since we know from statement 1 that the fleeg doesn't necessarily need to be surned, this scenario is not possible.\n\nTherefore, based on the information",
