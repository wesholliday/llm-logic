In other words, it is possible for the glip to exist without having tragged.\n\n2. \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged.\" This is an implication: if one thing is true (the glip being slogged), then another thing must also be true (the glip having tragged). However, this does not mean that the glip has necessarily been slogged; it's just a conditional statement about what would happen if it were.\n\nGiven these two statements together, we can infer:\n\n3. \"The glip was not slogged.\" This is because the first statement allows for the possibility that the glip does not have to tragged, and the second statement tells us that if it were slogged, then it would have to be tragged. Since we know from the first statement that it's possible for the glip to exist without having tragged",
