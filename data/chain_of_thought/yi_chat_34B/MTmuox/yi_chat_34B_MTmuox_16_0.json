In other words, there is a possibility that the sneg did not sprot the frink.\n\n2. \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink.\" This is a conditional statement: if A (the sneg being crampled) is true, then B (the sneg sproting the frink) must also be true. However, we know from the first statement that B (the sneg sproting the frink) might not be true.\n\n3. Since the possibility exists that the sneg did not sprot the frink, even if it was crampled, we cannot conclude with certainty whether the sneg was crampled or not based on the information provided. The second statement only tells us what would be true if the sneg were crampled, but since we already know from the first statement",
