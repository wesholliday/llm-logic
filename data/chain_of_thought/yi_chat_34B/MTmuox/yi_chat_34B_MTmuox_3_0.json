In other words, it is possible for the splat to exist without having quanked.\n\n2. \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked.\" This is an if-then statement where 'if' represents a condition (the splat being morphed) and 'then' represents a consequence (the splat must have quanked). It tells us that whenever the splat is morphed, it necessarily follows that it has quanked.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements to see if we can infer anything about whether the splat was morphed:\n\n- We know that it is possible for the splat to exist without having quanked (from statement 1).\n- We also know that if the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked (from statement 2).\n\nHowever, there is no direct contradiction or logical connection between",
