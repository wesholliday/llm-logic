In other words, there is a possibility that the flugel was not zargled.\n\n2. \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled.\" This is an implication statement. It tells us that if the flugel was blimmed, it would be necessary for it to also have been zargled. However, since we already know from statement 1 that the flugel might not have been zargled, this implies that the flugel cannot simultaneously be blimmed and not zargled.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer:\n\n3. \"The flugel was not blimmed.\" This is because if it were blimmed, it would contradict statement 1, which allows for the possibility that the flugel was not zargled. Since a contradiction cannot exist, we must conclude that the flugel was not bl",
