In other words, it is possible that the wug was not garpled.\n\n2. \"If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled.\" This is a conditional statement: if A (the wug being sproinged) happens, then B (the wug being garpled) must also happen. It implies that whenever the wug is sproinged, it is always followed by being garpled.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements to see if we can infer anything about whether the wug was sproinged:\n\n- We know from statement 1 that the wug might not have been garpled.\n- If the wug were sproinged (which is what we are trying to determine), then according to statement 2, it would have to be garpled.\n\nHowever, since we already know from statement 1 that the wug might",
