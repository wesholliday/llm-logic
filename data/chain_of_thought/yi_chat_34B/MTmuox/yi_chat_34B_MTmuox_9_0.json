It does not necessarily mean that the twonk is unvarnished, only that varnishing is not a requirement for the existence of the twonk.\n\n2. \"If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished.\" This is an implication: if the twonk was subjected to the action of being plinked, then it would be a necessary consequence that it was also varnished. However, this does not tell us whether the twonk was actually plinked or not.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot directly infer \"The twonk was not plinked\" because the first statement only says that varnishing is not mandatory for a twonk's existence, and the second statement establishes a condition (being plinked) that would necessitate varnishing but does not confirm whether the twonk was actually plinked.\n",
