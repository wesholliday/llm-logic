In other words, the flug could have been zimmed or it could not have been zimmed; we don't know for sure.\n\n2. \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed.\" This is a conditional statement: if A (the flug being blummed) occurs, then B (the flug being zimmed) must also occur. It establishes a necessary connection between two events.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements to see what we can infer:\n\n- From the first statement, we know that the flug might or might not have been zimmed.\n- The second statement tells us that if the flug was blummed, then it would necessarily have been zimmed as well.\n\nHowever, since we don't know whether the flug was actually zimmed (based on the first statement)",
