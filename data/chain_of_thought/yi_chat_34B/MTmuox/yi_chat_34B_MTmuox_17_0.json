In other words, it is possible for the flob to be in the same place as before, or it may have moved, but this possibility does not imply anything about whether it actually did move.\n\n2. \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated.\" This is a conditional statement that tells us if the flob were to be skizzled (whatever that means), then it would necessarily have moved. In other words, being skizzled implies movement for the flob.\n\nNow, let's try to infer something from these two statements:\n\n- If we know that the flob must not have movated (from statement 1), and we also know that if it were skizzled, it would have movated (from statement 2), then we can conclude that the flob cannot be both non-movated and skizzled.\n\nHowever, the original question",
