In other words, it is possible for the fribble to exist without having crinked.\n\n2. \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked.\" This is an implication: if one thing (the fribble being snurgled) happens, then another thing (the fribble crinkling) must also happen. It establishes a necessary connection between two events.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements to see what we can infer:\n\n- If the fribble was not snurgled, then based on the first statement, it is possible for the fribble to exist without having crinked.\n- However, if the fribble was snurgled, then according to the second statement, it must have crinked.\n\nSince we know that it's not a necessary truth that the fribble has cr",
