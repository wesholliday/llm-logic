In other words, it is possible that the dreb was not spent.\n\n2. \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spended.\" This is a conditional statement: if A (the dreb was vroombed), then B (the dreb must have been spended). It tells us that if we know A to be true, then B must also be true. However, it does not tell us whether A is true or false in the first place.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- We know that it is possible for the dreb not to have been spent (from statement 1).\n- If the dreb was vroombed, then it must have been spent (statement 2).\n\nSince we are told that it is possible for the dreb not to have been spent, and if it were vroombed, it would mean",
