We can represent this as A \u2192 B.\n\n2. \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" This is a factual statement that confirms one of the possible outcomes of the conditional statement, which is B.\n\nNow, we need to consider the validity of the inference based on these two statements:\n\n- If Lucy did not go to the zoo (B is false), then we could conclude that Joe did not go to the park because the conditional statement would be false in that case. However, since we know B is true, this scenario is not applicable.\n\n- The only other possibility is that A is true, which means Joe went to the park. If A were false (Joe did not go to the park), then the conditional statement would still be true because it'",
