So, A \u2192 B (A implies B).\n\n2. \"The robot visited Jupiter.\" This is a factual statement that tells us B is true.\n\nNow, we want to infer whether A (the alien visited Mars) is true or not. According to the rules of logic:\n\n- If A is true, then by the conditional statement A \u2192 B, B must also be true. Since we already know B is true (the robot visited Jupiter), this does not provide us with any new information about A.\n\n- However, if B is true (the robot visited Jupiter), it does not necessarily mean that A is true (the alien visited Mars) because the conditional statement only tells us that if A is true, then B must be true, but it does not guarantee that A is true given that B is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that the alien visited Mars just",
