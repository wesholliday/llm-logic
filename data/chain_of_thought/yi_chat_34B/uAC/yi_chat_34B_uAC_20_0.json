(conditional statement)\n   - The banana was yellow. (fact)\n\n2. From the second piece of information, we know that the banana is indeed yellow.\n\n3. To infer whether the apple was red, we need to consider the first piece of information: If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. Since we already know the banana is yellow, we can use this to determine if the apple must have been red.\n\n4. In a conditional statement, if the second part (the conclusion) is true, and we are told that the first part (the condition) is true, then we can infer that the original statement was true. However, in this case, we only know that the banana is yellow, not that the apple is red.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively conclude that the apple was red just because the banana was yellow. The conditional statement tells us what would be true if the condition (apple being red) were true, but it does not confirm the condition itself.\n",
