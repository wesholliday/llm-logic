(Implies a conditional relationship between the doll's material and the truck's material)\n   - The truck was metal. (This is an assertion of fact about the truck's material)\n\n2. From the second statement, we know that the condition for the first statement (the truck being metal) has been met.\n\n3. Since the condition for the first statement has been met, we can now apply the conditional relationship to infer the material of the doll.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the given information and the logical implications, we can conclude that the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by Step Reasoning:\n\n1.
