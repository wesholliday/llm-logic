(Premise 1)\n   - The book is a mystery novel. (Premise 2)\n\n2. Premise 2 tells us that the book is a mystery novel.\n\n3. We want to know if we can infer that the book was written by James based on these premises.\n\n4. To make this inference, we would need to use the first premise (Premise 1) which states that if the book were written by James, it would be a mystery novel.\n\n5. However, Premise 2 only tells us that the book is a mystery novel; it does not provide any information about who wrote it.\n\n6. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that the book was written by James. The fact that the book is a mystery novel does not necessarily mean that James wrote it. There could be other authors who have also written mystery novels.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by Step Reasoning:\n",
