(Implication 1)\n   - The unicorn was in the forest. (Fact 2)\n\n2. From Fact 2, we know that the unicorn was in the forest.\n\n3. Implication 1 tells us that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn would also be in the forest.\n\n4. Since we already know from Fact 2 that the unicorn is in the forest, we can use this to infer that the condition for Implication 1 (the griffin being in the forest) must also be true, because if it wasn't true, then Implication 1 would not hold.\n\n5. Therefore, based on our reasoning and the information provided, we can conclude that the griffin was in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1.
