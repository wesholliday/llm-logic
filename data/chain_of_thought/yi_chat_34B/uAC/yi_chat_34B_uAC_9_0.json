We are told that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This is a conditional statement where \"Lisa buying the red shirt\" is the condition (or hypothesis) and \"Mark buying the blue shirt\" is the consequence or result.\n\n2. We are also told that Mark bought the blue shirt. This is an independent piece of information that confirms one half of the conditional statement.\n\n3. The question now is whether we can conclude from Mark buying the blue shirt (which we know to be true) that Lisa bought the red shirt (which we do not yet know).\n\n4. To make this inference, we would need to establish a causal relationship where if the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is met, then the result (Mark buying the blue shirt) must occur. However, we are only given information about the result occurring; we do not have any information about whether the condition has been met or not.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively infer that Lisa bought the red shirt just",
