(Implies a conditional relationship between the color of the car and the truck)\n   - The truck was blue. (Establishes the color of the truck as blue)\n\n2. According to the first statement, if the car is red, it guarantees that the truck will be blue.\n\n3. Since we know the truck is blue, we can assume that the condition for the truck being blue has been met.\n\n4. However, the second statement does not specify whether the car's color is red or not; it only confirms that the truck is blue.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively conclude that the car was red just because the truck was blue. The first statement tells us what would happen if the car were red, but it does not confirm the actual color of the car.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by Step Reasoning:\n\n1.
