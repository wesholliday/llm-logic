We are told that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would be there too. This is a conditional statement: \"If Mary, then Sue.\"\n2. We are also told that Sue was at the wedding.\n3. The question is whether we can infer from these two pieces of information that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's apply the logic:\n\n- If Mary were at the wedding, and we know that if she is there, then Sue must also be there, then we would have a valid inference to say that Sue being there implies Mary was there too.\n- However, we are only told that Sue was at the wedding; we do not have any information about whether Mary was actually present or not.\n- Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer that Mary was at the wedding just because Sue was there. We would need additional information to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[THINK]\nTo determine whether we can infer that Mary was at the wedding, let'",
