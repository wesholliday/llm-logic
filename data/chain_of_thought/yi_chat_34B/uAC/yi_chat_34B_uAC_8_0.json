The mummy was awake.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the mummy was awake. According to statement 1, if the vampire were awake, it would mean that the mummy is also awake. Since we already know from statement 2 that the mummy is awake, it suggests that the condition in statement 1 (the vampire being awake) must be true for the consequence (the mummy being awake) to occur.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the logical relationship between the statements, we can infer that the vampire was awake.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|><|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|><|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes",
