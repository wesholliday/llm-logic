Chris finished the race.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that Chris did indeed finish the race. Now, let's look at statement 1. This is an example of a conditional statement, which can be represented as A \u2192 B, where A is Alex finishing the race and B is Chris finishing the race. According to the rules of inference for conditional statements, if we know that B is true (Chris finished the race), then we cannot conclude anything definitively about A (Alex finishing the race) without additional information.\n\nIn other words, knowing that Chris finished the race does not automatically mean that Alex also finished the race. There could be scenarios where Alex did not finish the race, even though statement 1 suggests a relationship between their finishes. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP",
