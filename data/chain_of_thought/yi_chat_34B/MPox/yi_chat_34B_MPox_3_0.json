It establishes a relationship between two events: if the splat being morphed is true (the condition), then the splat quanking must also be true.\n\nGiven these statements, we can infer that since the splat was morphed (which we know to be true), it follows logically from the conditional statement that the splat must have quanked as well.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
