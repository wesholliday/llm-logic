It establishes a logical relationship between two events: if the fribble is snurgled, it will also crinkle.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer the following:\n\n- Since \"The fribble was snurgled\" is true, we can consider the condition of the conditional statement to be met.\n- Therefore, according to the conditional statement, \"the fribble crinked\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
