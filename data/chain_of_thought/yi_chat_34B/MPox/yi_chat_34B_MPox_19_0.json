(This is a conditional statement; it tells us what would happen if the first statement were true)\n\nNow, since we know that the smonk was indeed vreebled (based on fact 1), we can apply the conditional statement to conclude:\n\n3. The smonk plagged. (This is what we are trying to infer from the given information)\n\nTherefore, based on the provided facts and the logical relationship between them, we can infer that 'The smonk plagged'.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n",
