It establishes a relationship between being \"plooked\" and being \"nugged.\" If something is plooked, it necessarily follows that it is also nugged.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer:\n\n- Since the shank was plooked (according to Statement 1),\n- And if a shank is plooked, it must be nugged (according to Statement 2),\n- Therefore, the shank was nugged.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
