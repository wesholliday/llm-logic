If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the grommet was sploffed. This establishes a condition that was met.\n\nStatement 2 introduces a conditional statement: if the grommet was sploffed, then it plopped the frink. Conditional statements in logic are typically represented as \"If P, then Q\" where P is the condition (in this case, \"the grommet was sploffed\") and Q is the consequence or result (\"the grommet plopped the frink\").\n\nGiven that we have established that the condition (P: the grommet was sploffed) is true, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that the consequence (Q: the grommet plopped the frink) must also be true. This is because, in a valid conditional statement, if the antecedent (the part before 'then') is true, then the consequent (the part",
