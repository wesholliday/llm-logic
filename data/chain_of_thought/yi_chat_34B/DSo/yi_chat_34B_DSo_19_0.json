The second statement, \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist,\" provides two possible locations for the watch: on the person's wrist or on the dresser.\n3. Since we already know that the watch isn't on the person's wrist (based on the first statement), the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the watch must be on the dresser.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that \"The watch is charging on the dresser\" based on the information provided by both statements.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
