Either the phone is in the living room or it is ringing in the kitchen.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the phone is not making any sound in the kitchen. This means that if the phone were to be ringing, it would have to be somewhere other than the kitchen.\n\nStatement 2 gives us two possibilities: either the phone is in the living room or it is ringing in the kitchen. However, since we already know from statement 1 that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen, the only remaining possibility is that the phone must be in the living room.\n\nTherefore, based on these two statements, we can infer that the phone is in the living room.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n",
