The statement \"The toy isn't sitting on the shelf\" tells us that the toy is not in one of the two possible locations mentioned: the shelf or the toy box.\n2. The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf\" is a logical disjunction, which means that the toy must be in one of those two locations.\n3. Since we already know from the first statement that the toy is not on the shelf, the only remaining option is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The toy is in the toy box.\"<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
