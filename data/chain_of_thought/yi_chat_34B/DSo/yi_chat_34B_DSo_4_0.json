Since both options presented in statement 2 are mutually exclusive (i.e., they cannot both be true at the same time), and one of them must be true, we can conclude that if the cat is not playing in the bedroom, it must be napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
