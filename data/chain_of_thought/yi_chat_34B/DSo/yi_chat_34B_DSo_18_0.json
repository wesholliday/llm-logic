The statement \"The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand\" tells us that the notebook is not in a specific location, which is on the nightstand.\n2. The second statement, \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand,\" presents two possibilities for the notebook's location: in the drawer or on the nightstand.\n3. Since we already know from the first statement that the notebook is not on the nightstand, the only remaining possibility is that the notebook must be in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, based on these two statements, we can infer that \"The notebook is in the drawer.\"<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
