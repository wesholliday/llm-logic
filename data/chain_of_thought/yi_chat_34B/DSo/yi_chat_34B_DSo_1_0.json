It also means that if Fido is not in the garden, then he must be inside.\n\nGiven these two statements together:\n- We know from statement 1 that Fido is not in the garden.\n- According to statement 2, since Fido is not in the garden, he must be inside (because it's an exclusive disjunction and there are no other options given).\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'Fido is inside' from the information provided.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESET]Resetting the conversation.
