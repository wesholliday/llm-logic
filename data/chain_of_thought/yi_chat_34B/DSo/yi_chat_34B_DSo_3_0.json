The statement \"The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet\" tells us that the keys are not in a certain location (the cabinet) and are not in a specific state (dangling).\n2. The second statement, \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet,\" presents two possibilities for the location of the keys: either in the drawer or in the cabinet.\n3. Since we know from the first statement that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, the only remaining possibility is that they must be in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The keys are in the drawer.\"<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]",
