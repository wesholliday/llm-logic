In this case, A is \"the book was written by James,\" and B is \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nStep 2: The second statement provides us with information about the first part of the conditional statement - \"the book was written by James.\" This means that the condition (A) is true.\n\nStep 3: Since A is true, we can apply the transitive property of logic to conclude that B must also be true. The transitive property states that if A implies B and A is true, then B must be true as well.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the book is a mystery novel.<|im_end|>\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step 1: Consider the first statement - \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This is an example of a conditional statement in logic",
