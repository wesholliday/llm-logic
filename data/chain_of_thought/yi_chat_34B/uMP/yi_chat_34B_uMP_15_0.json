It states that if the first condition (Sam taking a plane) is true, then the second condition (Erin taking a train) must also be true.\n\n3. Since we have confirmed that Sam did indeed take a plane (which is the first condition of the conditional statement), we can conclude that according to the rules set by the conditional statement, Erin must have taken a train.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
