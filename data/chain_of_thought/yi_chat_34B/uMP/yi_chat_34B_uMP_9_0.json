The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement. It establishes a relationship between two events: Lisa buying the red shirt (the condition) and Mark buying the blue shirt (the consequence or result).\n\n2. We are also given that \"Lisa bought the red shirt.\" This means that the condition in the conditional statement has been met.\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the consequence (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the logical relationship between the events, we can infer that Mark bought the blue shirt.<|im_end|>\n[ANSWER]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[THINK]\nTo determine if we can infer that Lisa bought the red shirt, let's consider the given information step by step:\n\n1.
