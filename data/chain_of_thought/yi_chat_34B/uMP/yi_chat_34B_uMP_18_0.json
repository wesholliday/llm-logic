The statement says \"if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This is a conditional statement where being plastic for the doll is a necessary condition for the truck to be metal.\n\n2. The statement also says that the doll was plastic. This provides us with evidence that the first part of the conditional statement (the antecedent) is true.\n\n3. Since the antecedent (the doll being plastic) is true, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that the second part (the truck being metal) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the logical relationship between the doll and the truck, we can infer that the truck was metal.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
