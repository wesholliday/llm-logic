The statement \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" is a conditional statement with 'the alien visiting Mars' as the antecedent and 'the robot visiting Jupiter' as the consequent.\n\n2. We are also told that 'the alien visited Mars.' This means that the antecedent of the conditional statement is true.\n\n3. In a valid argument, if the antecedent is true and the conditional statement is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n\nTherefore, since we have a true antecedent ('the alien visited Mars') and a true conditional statement ('If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter'), we can infer that the consequent ('the robot visited Jupiter') is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No response provided.
