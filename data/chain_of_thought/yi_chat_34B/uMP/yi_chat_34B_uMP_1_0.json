We are told that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. This is a conditional statement: \"If Mary, then Sue.\"\n2. We are also told that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nNow, we need to apply the information we have to see if we can conclude anything about Sue. Since we know that Mary was at the wedding and the condition (Mary being there) is met, we can infer from the conditional statement that Sue must also be at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that Sue was at the wedding.<|im_end|>\n[ANSWER]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[THINK]\nTo determine whether we can infer that Sue was at the wedding, let's consider the information given step by step:\n\n1.
