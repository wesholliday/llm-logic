(consequent of the conditional statement)\n\n2. According to the rules of logic for a conditional statement, if the consequent is true, then the antecedent must also be true. In other words, since the second statement confirms that the shirt was cotton, we can conclude that the first statement's condition (\"if the shirt was cotton\") is met.\n\n3. Therefore, because both the condition and the consequence of the conditional statement are true, we can infer that the pants were denim.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
