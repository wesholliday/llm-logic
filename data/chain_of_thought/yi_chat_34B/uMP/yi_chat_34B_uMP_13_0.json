Since we know the car was red (which is the hypothesis of the conditional statement), we can conclude that the truck must be blue (as per the conditional statement) because there is no reason to believe that the conditional statement would be false given the information provided.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by Step Reasoning:\n\n1.
