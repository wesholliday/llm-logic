We are given two statements:\n   - If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n   - Sue chose pizza.\n\n2. The first statement is an \"if-then\" proposition, which means it describes a condition where if one thing happens (Sue choosing pizza), another thing must happen (Bob choosing pasta).\n\n3. We are also told that the condition (Sue choosing pizza) has occurred.\n\n4. Therefore, according to the rules of logic, since the \"if\" part of the statement is true (Sue chose pizza), the \"then\" part must also be true (Bob chose pasta).\n\n[REASON]\nBased on the provided information and our logical reasoning, we can conclude that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob did indeed choose pasta.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[THINK]\nTo determine if we can infer that Bob chose pasta based on the information provided, let's consider the following:\n\n1.
