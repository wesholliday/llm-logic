The second premise says that the truck was not blue (\u00actruck blue).\n3. From the first premise and the second premise, we can use logical reasoning to deduce that since the truck is not blue, it must be the case that the car is not red (because if it were red, the truck would have to be blue according to the first premise, which contradicts the second premise).\n4. Therefore, based on the given premises, the conclusion 'The car was not red' logically follows.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
