This is a conditional statement where 'Alex finishing the race' is the antecedent and 'Chris finishing the race' is the consequent.\n\n2. The second premise tells us that Chris did not finish the race. This provides us with information about the truth value of one part of the conditional statement (the consequent).\n\n3. The conclusion states that Alex did not finish the race. To determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to assess whether the truth of the second premise (Chris not finishing the race) guarantees the truth of the conclusion (Alex not finishing the race) based on the first premise.\n\n4. If the antecedent (Alex finishing the race) were true, then by the first premise, the consequent (Chris finishing the race) would also have to be true. However, since we know from the second premise that Chris did not finish the race, this means that the antecedent must be false.\n\n5. If the antecedent is false, it does not necessarily mean that the conclusion (Alex not finishing the race",
