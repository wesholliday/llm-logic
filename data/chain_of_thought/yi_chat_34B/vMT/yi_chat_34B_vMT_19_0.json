            "content": "\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. The first premise states that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where P represents \"Tom watched football\" and Q represents \"Jen watched basketball\".\n\n2. The second premise tells us that Jen did not watch basketball. This directly contradicts the first premise, which says that if Tom watched football, then Jen would have watched basketball. Since we now know that Jen did not watch basketball, it means that the condition for Tom watching football is not met.\n\n3. Therefore, based on the second premise alone, we can conclude that Tom must not have watched football, because otherwise, the first premise would be false (since it states that if Tom watched football, then Jen would have watched basketball).\n\n4. The conclusion of the argument is \"Tom did not watch football\". This directly follows from our reasoning in step 3, where we determined that since Jen did not watch basketball, which is a necessary condition for Tom watching football according to the first premise, Tom must not have watched football.\n\nBased on this line of reasoning, the form of the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily",
