The argument has two premises and a conclusion:\n\n1. If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. (Premise 1)\n2. Erin did not take a train. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Sam did not take a plane. (Conclusion)\n\nWe can represent this argument in symbolic form as follows:\n\nIf P, then Q (P \u2192 Q)  (Premise 1)\nNot Q (\u00acQ)            (Premise 2)\nTherefore, Not P (\u00acP)   (Conclusion)\n\nThe logical structure of the argument is based on the contrapositive form of an implication. The contrapositive of an implication P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP. This means that if we can show that the second premise (\u00acQ) logically implies the third premise (\u00acP), then the argument is valid.\n\nHowever, in this case, we have the first premise (P \u2192 Q) and the second premise (\u00acQ), which do not directly lead",
