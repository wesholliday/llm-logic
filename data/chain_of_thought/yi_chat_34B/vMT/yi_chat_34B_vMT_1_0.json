Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Understanding Premises and Conclusion**: The first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must also have been there. This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\" where A is 'Mary being at the wedding' and B is 'Sue being at the wedding'.\n\n2. **Evaluating Premises**: The second premise tells us that Sue was not at the wedding. This directly contradicts the first premise if we assume that Mary was at the wedding.\n\n3. **Considering the Conclusion**: The conclusion states that Mary was not at the wedding. If this is true, then the first premise (the conditional statement) is not contradicted because both parts of the condition (Mary being at the wedding and Sue being at the wedding) are false.\n\n4. **Testing for Validity**: A valid argument is one where the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. In this case, if the second premise (Sue not being at the wedding) is true, then it directly contradicts the first premise (",
