The second premise says that the robot did not visit Jupiter (\u00acR).\n3. From the first premise and the second premise, we can use the contrapositive rule to conclude that if \u00acR is true, then \u00ac(A \u2192 R) must also be true.\n4. Since the contrapositive of A \u2192 R is \u00acA or \u00acR (depending on whether you consider A \u2192 R as an implication or its contrapositive), we can infer that \u00acA must be true because \u00acR is given and R is a necessary condition for A in the first premise.\n5. Therefore, based on the premises provided, we can conclude that the alien did not visit Mars (\u00acA).\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
