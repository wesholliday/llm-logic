The second premise says that Mark did not buy the blue shirt (in symbolic form: ~M).\n3. The conclusion is that Lisa did not buy the red shirt (in symbolic form: ~L).\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate whether the premises necessarily lead to the conclusion. In other words, if the first premise is true and the second premise is true, does it guarantee that the conclusion must also be true?\n\nIn this case, the first premise (If L -> M) is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (L) is true, then the consequent (M) must be true. However, the second premise (~M) negates the consequent of the conditional statement. According to the rules of logic, when the consequent of a conditional is false, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent must also be false. It could still be true or false.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises",
