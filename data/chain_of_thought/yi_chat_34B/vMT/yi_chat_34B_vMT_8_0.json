The second premise says that the mummy was not awake (negation of the antecedent).\n3. From the first premise and the negation of the antecedent in the second premise, we can infer that the vampire must also have been asleep (by the contrapositive of the conditional statement).\n4. Therefore, the conclusion 'The vampire was not awake' follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
