The second premise says that the banana was not yellow (\"Not B\").\n3. From these premises, we can use the logical operator 'implies' to conclude that since B is false and A implies B, then A must also be false.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion \"The apple was not red\" follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
