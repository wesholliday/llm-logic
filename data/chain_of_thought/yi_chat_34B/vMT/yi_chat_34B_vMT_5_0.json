This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where P represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q represents \"Amy played tennis\".\n\n2. The second premise tells us that Amy did not play tennis. This is a negation of the Q part of the conditional statement.\n\n3. The conclusion states that Jeff did not play basketball. This is a negation of the P part of the conditional statement.\n\n4. In order for an argument to be logically valid, it must be the case that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\n5. If we assume the first premise (the conditional) is true, and the second premise (the negation of Q) is true, then the conclusion (the negation of P) must necessarily follow. This is because if it is not the case that Q (Amy played tennis), then by the truth table for conditionals, it must be the case that P (Jeff did not play basketball) is false as well.\n\n6. Therefore, given the truth values of the premises,",
