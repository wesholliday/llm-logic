This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n2. The second premise says that the cat was not outside. This directly contradicts the first premise (since it's saying \"not B\").\n3. In a valid argument, if one of the premises is false, the argument as a whole is not valid.\n4. Since we have a situation where one premise (the second one) negates the other premise (the first one), we cannot logically conclude that both premises can be true at the same time.\n5. Therefore, because the two premises are contradictory, the argument is not logically valid.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n\n",
