The second premise says that Bob did not choose pasta. This is a claim about the truth value of one of the possible outcomes of the conditional statement (B) being false.\n3. The conclusion states that Sue did not choose pizza. This is a claim about the truth value of the other outcome of the conditional statement (A) being false as well.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the truth of the second premise (Bob not choosing pasta) guarantees the truth of the conclusion (Sue not choosing pizza) given the first premise (If Sue chooses pizza, then Bob chooses pasta).\n\nIn this case, the first premise sets up a condition where if A (Sue choosing pizza) is true, then B (Bob choosing pasta) must also be true. However, the second premise tells us that B is not true (Bob did not choose pasta). This means that the condition for A to be true (the entire \"If A, then B\" statement) is not met",
