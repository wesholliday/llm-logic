The first premise states that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel (in logical notation, this would be represented as \"If A, then B\" where A = 'the book was written by James' and B = 'the book is a mystery novel').\n\n2. The second premise says that the book is not a mystery novel (not B).\n\n3. From the first premise, we can infer that if A were true (if the book were written by James), then B would be true (it would be a mystery novel). However, since the second premise tells us that B is not true (the book is not a mystery novel), we can conclude that A must also not be true (the book was not written by James).\n\n4. The conclusion states that the book was not written by James, which directly follows from the first and second premises.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
