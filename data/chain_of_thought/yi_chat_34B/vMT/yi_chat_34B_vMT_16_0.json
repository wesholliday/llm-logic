The argument starts with a conditional statement (If A, then B), which means that if the first premise is true (the shirt was cotton), then the second part must also be true (the pants were denim).\n\n2. The second premise directly contradicts the second part of the first premise by stating that the pants were not denim.\n\n3. Since the second premise negates the second part of the conditional statement, we can conclude that the entire conditional statement is false. This means that the shirt cannot be cotton if the pants are not denim.\n\n4. The conclusion then follows from this contradiction: since the first premise (If A, then B) is false, and the second premise negates B, then A must also be false. In other words, if the pants are not denim, and if that implies the shirt being cotton, then the shirt cannot be cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
