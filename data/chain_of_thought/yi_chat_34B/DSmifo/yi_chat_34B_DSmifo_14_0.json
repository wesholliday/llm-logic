The statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the refrigerator.\n2. The second statement, \"Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter,\" presents two options for where the milk could be: in the fridge or on the counter.\n3. Since we know from the first statement that there is a chance the milk is not in the fridge, and given that the second statement tells us the milk must be in one of those two locations, it logically follows that if the milk is not in the fridge, it must be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
