The statement \"Either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar\" tells us that the cookies have to be in one of two places: the pantry or the jar.\n3. Since we already know from step 1 that there is a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry, and step 2 tells us that they must be in one of the two locations, it logically follows that if they are not in the pantry, they must be in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
