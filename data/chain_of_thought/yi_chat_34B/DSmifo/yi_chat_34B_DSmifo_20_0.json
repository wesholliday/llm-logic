The statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" suggests that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not worn on her head.\n2. The statement \"Either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag\" tells us that the sunglasses are either being worn (perched on her head) or they are located in her bag.\n3. Since we know from step 1 that they might not be perched on her head, and given the information in step 2, we can infer that if they are not on her head, then they must be in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
