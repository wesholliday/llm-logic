It could be anywhere else except the bookshelf.\n\n2. \"Either the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box.\" This statement presents a logical disjunction: the toy is either on the bookshelf or in the toy box, but not both (since 'must' implies exclusivity). However, this does not provide any information about where the toy actually is.\n\nGiven these two statements alone, we cannot definitively infer that \"The toy is in the toy box.\" The first statement allows for other possibilities, and the second statement only establishes a logical possibility without specifying which of the two options (bookshelf or toy box) is true.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n",
