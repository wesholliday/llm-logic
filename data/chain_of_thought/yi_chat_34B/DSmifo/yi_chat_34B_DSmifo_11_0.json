The statement \"The newspaper might not be sitting on the porch\" implies that there is a possibility that the newspaper is not where it is expected to be.\n2. The statement \"Either the newspaper must be sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway\" presents two options for where the newspaper could be: on the porch or in the driveway.\n3.
