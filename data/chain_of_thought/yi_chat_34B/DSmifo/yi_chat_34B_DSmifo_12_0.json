It could be elsewhere or even missing.\n\n2. \"Either the jacket must be hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair.\" This statement presents two options: the jacket is either hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair. However, it does not specify which option is true.\n\nGiven these statements alone, we cannot definitively infer that \"The jacket is draped over the chair.\" The first statement allows for other possibilities, and the second statement provides two options without confirming either one. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot conclude that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>",
