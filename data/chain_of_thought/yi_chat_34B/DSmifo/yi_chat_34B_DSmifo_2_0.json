Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. However, this does not necessarily mean that the book is on the shelf because there are other possible locations for the book as well (e.g., on the floor, in a bag, etc.).\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the book must be either on the table or on the shelf. Since we already know from statement 1 that it might not be on the table, the only option left is that it is on the shelf.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided by both statements together, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
