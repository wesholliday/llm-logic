The statement \"The watch might not be on his wrist\" suggests that there is a possibility that the watch is not where it is typically found, which is on the person's wrist.\n2. The second statement, \"Either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser,\" provides two options for the location of the watch: on the person's wrist or on the dresser, charging.\n3. Since we know from the first statement that the watch might not be on his wrist, we can eliminate that option as a certainty.\n4. Therefore, if the watch is not on his wrist, it must be true that it is charging on the dresser, according to the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
