It does not specify which of these is true, only that one of them must be the case.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned.\" This statement negates the first possibility given in the first statement. Since we know both possibilities cannot be false (because it's a logical disjunction), and we now know the first one is false, the second possibility must be true by default.\n\n3. The second possibility from the first statement is that \"the fleeg is bluttered.\" Since we have established that the first possibility is not true (the fleeg does not need to be surned), and there are only two possibilities given, we can infer that the fleeg must be bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response. Thank you for your question. If you have",
