It does not specify which of these alternatives is true, only that one of them must be the case.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked.\" This statement negates the first alternative presented in the first statement. If we take this as true, then the only remaining possibility is the second alternative: The splat is morphed.\n\nGiven these two statements and their logical relationship, we can indeed infer that 'The splat is morphed' follows from 'It's not the case that the splat must be quanked'.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
