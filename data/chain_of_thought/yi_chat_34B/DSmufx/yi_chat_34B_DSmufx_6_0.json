It implies that one of these conditions must be true.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped.\" This statement negates the first alternative, meaning we can conclude that the grommet does not have to be plopped.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer:\n\n- The grommet is not plopped (because it's not required to be).\n- Since one of the alternatives must be true, and the first alternative is false, the second alternative must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]The grommet is sploffed.<|im_end|>\n",
