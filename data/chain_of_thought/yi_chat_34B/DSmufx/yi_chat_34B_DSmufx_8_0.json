            "content": "[SYS]To determine whether we can infer 'The sprocket is cranked' from the given statements, let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. The first statement says 'Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked'. This is a logical disjunction, meaning that one of two conditions must be true.\n\n2. The second statement says 'It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled'. This is a negation of the first part of the disjunction. Since we are told that it's not mandatory for the sprocket to be daggled, then logically the other part of the disjunction must be true.\n\n3. The other part of the disjunction is 'The sprocket is cranked'. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that 'The sprocket is cranked' must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Yes<|im_end|>\n",
