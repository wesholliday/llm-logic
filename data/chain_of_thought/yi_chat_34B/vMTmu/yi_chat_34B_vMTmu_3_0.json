The second premise says that it is not the case that the book must be a mystery novel (Premise 2).\n3. Premise 2 directly contradicts Premise 1, as it negates the conclusion of Premise 1.\n4. Since both premises cannot be true at the same time, there is a logical conflict between them.\n5. The conclusion states that because it's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel (which is what Premise 2 says), then the book was not written by James (Conclusion).\n6. However, the validity of an argument depends on whether the premises, if true, would guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n7. In this case, because there is a logical conflict between the two premises, we cannot say that one premise guarantees the truth of the other.\n8. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: no<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n",
