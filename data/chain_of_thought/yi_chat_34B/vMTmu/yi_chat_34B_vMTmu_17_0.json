The first premise states that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad (conditional statement: Ben eating pasta -> Kate eating salad).\n2. The second premise says it is not the case that Kate must have eaten salad (negation of the conclusion of the first premise: ~(Kate eating salad)).\n3. Since the second premise negates the conclusion of the first premise, we can infer from the first premise that Ben did not eat pasta (by contraposition: if not Kate eating salad, then not Ben eating pasta).\n4. The conclusion states that Ben did not eat pasta, which is consistent with our inference based on the first and second premises.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the argument appears to be logically valid because the conclusion follows from the premises without any logical contradictions.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
