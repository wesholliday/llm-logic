Here are the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\n2. It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\n3. The griffin was not in the forest.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n- Premise 1 is an \"if-then\" statement, which means it follows the logical form of a conditional or hypothetical proposition. It states that if one thing is true (the griffin being in the forest), then another thing must be true (the unicorn being in the forest).\n\n- Premise 2 denies the necessity of the unicorn being in the forest. In other words, it asserts that the unicorn might not have been in the forest.\n\n- The conclusion states that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nThe argument seems to be trying to establish a logical connection between the presence of the griffin and the presence of the unicorn.
