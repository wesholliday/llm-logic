This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where P = Jeff played basketball and Q = Amy must have played tennis.\n\n2. The second premise says it's not the case that Amy must have played tennis. This means that the condition Q (Amy playing tennis) is false.\n\n3. In a valid argument form known as modus tollens, if the conclusion Q is false and one of the premises is \"If P, then Q\", then we can conclude that the antecedent P must also be false. This is because if Q is false and P were true, it would mean that the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is false, which contradicts the premise that P implies Q.\n\n4. Applying modus tollens to this argument, since Q (Amy playing tennis) is false according to the second premise, and we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" in the first premise, we can conclude that P (Jeff playing basketball) must also be false.\n\n5.
