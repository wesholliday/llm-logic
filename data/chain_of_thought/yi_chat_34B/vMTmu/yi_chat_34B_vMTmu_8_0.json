Here are the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\n2. It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\n3. Therefore, the vampire was not awake.\n\nLet's break down the argument step by step:\n\n- Premise 1 is an \"if-then\" statement, which in logic can be represented as A \u2192 B, where A is 'the vampire was awake' and B is 'the mummy must have been awake'.\n- Premise 2 states that it is not the case that B (the mummy must have been awake). In other words, not B.\n- The conclusion is that not A (the vampire was not awake).\n\nThe logical structure of the argument can be represented as follows:\n\nA \u2192 B  (Premise 1)\nnot B   (Premise 2)\nTherefore, not A  (Conclusion)\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus tollens",
