This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n2. The second premise says it's not the case that the cat must have been outside. This means we are negating the possible outcome of the first premise (B).\n3. The conclusion states that the dog was not inside. This is effectively saying that the condition in the first premise (A) did not occur, because if A were true, B would also have to be true according to the first premise, but we've already established that B is not the case.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows from the premises. If the condition for the dog being inside (A) does not lead to the cat being outside (B) as stated in the second premise, then it must be the case that A did not occur, which is what the conclusion says: The dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
