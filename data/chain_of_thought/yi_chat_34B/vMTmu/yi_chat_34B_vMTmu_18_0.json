            "content": "[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1. The first premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n2. The second premise says it's not the case that the truck must have been metal. This means we are given information that contradicts the first premise (if A, then B) by providing evidence that B is not true.\n3. Since the second premise negates the truth of B (the truck being metal), we can conclude that the condition A (the doll being plastic) must also be false in order for the first premise to be consistent with the second premise.\n4. The conclusion states that the doll was not plastic. This directly follows from our reasoning that if B is not true (truck not metal), then A cannot be true (doll not plastic) according to the first premise.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the argument form is logically valid because it follows a valid logical structure where the truth of one premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion. The second premise acts as a kind of \"proof by contradiction\" that leads to the negation of the first premise's condition",
