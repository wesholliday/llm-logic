This is represented as \"If P, then Q\" where P = Sam took a plane and Q = Erin must have taken a train.\n\n2. The second premise says it's not the case that Erin must have taken a train. This can be represented as \"Not Q\".\n\n3. The conclusion states that Sam did not take a plane, which is represented as \"Not P\".\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to consider the structure of the argument and not the specific content of the premises. In this case, the argument has the form:\n\nIf P, then Q.\nNot Q.\nTherefore, Not P.\n\nThis is an instance of the logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent\" or \"modus ponens\" (if P, then Q; Q; therefore, P) done backwards. The correct structure for a valid argument would be:\n\nIf P, then Q.\nP.\nTherefore, Q.\n\nOr, in the case of this argument'",
