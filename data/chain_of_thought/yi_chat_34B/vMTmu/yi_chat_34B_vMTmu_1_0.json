            "content": "[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1. The first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This is a conditional statement where 'Mary being at the wedding' is the antecedent and 'Sue being at the wedding' is the consequent.\n\n2. The second premise says it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. This means that we are told explicitly that Sue was not necessarily at the wedding, which contradicts the first premise if Mary were to be at the wedding.\n\n3. The conclusion states that Mary was not at the wedding. If we assume that the first premise is true (which says that if Mary is at the wedding, then so must Sue) and the second premise is true (which says that Sue is not necessarily at the wedding), then it logically follows that Mary cannot be at the wedding because that would contradict the second premise.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, the conclusion that 'Mary was not at the wedding' is a logical consequence of the stated conditions.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
