This is a conditional statement where \"if A, then B\" means that whenever A is true, B must also be true.\n\n2. The second premise says it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow. In other words, the negation of the first premise is asserted: \"It is not the case that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" This means that even if the apple were red, the banana would not necessarily be yellow.\n\n3. The conclusion states that the apple was not red. It is derived from the second premise, which implies that since the banana's color is not determined by the apple's color (red), the apple cannot be red because its supposed relationship to the banana's color would be false.\n\nThe argument seems to be logically valid because it follows a valid logical form: if A then B, but not B, therefore not A. This is a standard pattern for a valid argument in logic. However, I will need to check with a formal system of logic to ensure that",
