The first premise states that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den (conditional statement: Bear in cave \u2192 Wolf in den).\n2. The second premise says it is not the case that the wolf must have been in the den (negation of the conclusion of the first premise: \u00ac(Wolf in den)).\n3. From the second premise, we can infer that the bear being in the cave does not necessarily lead to the wolf being in the den, which means the condition (Bear in cave) is not met or has no effect on the outcome (Wolf in den).\n4. The conclusion states that the bear was not in the cave. This is a direct contradiction to the first premise, which suggests that if the bear were in the cave, the wolf would have to be in the den.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the argument is not logically valid because it does not follow from the premises that the bear must not have been in the cave. The second premise only negates the necessity of the wolf being in the den given the bear's presence in the cave; it does not provide any information about",
