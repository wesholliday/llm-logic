This leaves two possibilities: it could be somewhere else or it could be stuffed in my backpack.\n\n2. The second statement, \"Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack,\" presents a logical OR condition. Since we already know from the first statement that it's not mandatory for the scarf to be on the coat rack, the only remaining option is that it is stuffed in my backpack.\n\n3. Therefore, based on these two statements together, we can infer that \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\"\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
