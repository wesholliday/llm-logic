The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" means that the remote control does not have to be under the couch; it could be somewhere else or even not hidden at all.\n2. The statement \"Either the remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table\" presents two possibilities: the remote control is either under the couch or on the coffee table.\n3. Since we know from point 1 that the remote control does not have to be under the couch, and there are only two options given in point 2, then by process of elimination, the remote control must be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
