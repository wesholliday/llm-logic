The statement \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist\" implies that there are other possibilities for where the watch could be besides being on his wrist.\n2. The statement \"Either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser\" presents two options: the watch is on his wrist, or it is charging on the dresser.\n3. Since we have been told that the watch is not necessarily on his wrist, we can eliminate the first option from consideration.\n4. With only one option left (the watch being charged on the dresser), we can conclude that this must be the case.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
