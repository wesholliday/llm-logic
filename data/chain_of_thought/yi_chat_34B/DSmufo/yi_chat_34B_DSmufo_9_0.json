Since we already know from statement 1 that it's not on the floor, this means that the only remaining possibility is that it is in the box.\n\nBased on these two statements and their logical implications, we can indeed infer:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]The missing puzzle piece is in the box.<|im_end|>\n",
