We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\"\n   - \"Either the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet or it is in the car.\"\n\n2. The first statement implies that the umbrella does not have to be in the closet, which means it can be somewhere else.\n\n3. The second statement presents a logical disjunction: either the umbrella is in the closet or it is in the car. Since we know from the first statement that it's not in the closet, the only other option left is that it is in the car.\n\n4. Therefore, based on these two statements together, we can infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
