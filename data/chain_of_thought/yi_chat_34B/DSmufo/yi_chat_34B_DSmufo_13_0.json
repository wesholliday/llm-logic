We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n   - \"Either the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box.\"\n\n2. The first statement implies that the toy does not have to be on the bookshelf, which means there are other possible locations for the toy.\n\n3. The second statement presents a logical OR condition: if the toy is not on the bookshelf, then it must be in the toy box (since these are the only two options given).\n\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the toy does not have to be on the bookshelf, the second statement tells us that the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
