We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n   - \"Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer.\"\n\n2. The first statement negates the possibility of the keys being a certain way (dangling in the cabinet), but it does not specify where the keys are. It only tells us that their location is not mandatory to be in the cabinet.\n\n3. The second statement presents two possibilities: the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer. Since we know from the first statement that they cannot be dangling in the cabinet, this eliminates one of the options presented in the second statement.\n\n4. With only these two statements to consider, and given that the keys cannot be dangling in the cabinet, the only remaining option is that they are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
