The statement \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\" implies that there is a possibility that the jacket is not hanging in the closet.\n2. The statement \"Either the jacket must be hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair\" presents two options: the jacket is hanging in the closet, or it is draped over the chair.\n3. Since we have established that the jacket might not be hanging in the closet (based on the first statement), and there are only two options given, the only remaining option is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
