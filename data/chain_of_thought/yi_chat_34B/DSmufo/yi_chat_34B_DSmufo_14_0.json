We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" (which means the milk might not be in the fridge).\n   - \"Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter\" (this is a disjunction, meaning one of two things must be true).\n\n2. Since the first statement tells us that the milk might not be in the fridge, and the second statement says that if it's not in the fridge, it must be on the counter, we can infer:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n",
