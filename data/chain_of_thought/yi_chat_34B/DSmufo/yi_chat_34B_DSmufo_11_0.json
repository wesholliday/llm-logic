The first statement says 'It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch'. This means that the newspaper does not have to be on the porch; it could be somewhere else or even nowhere at all.\n\n2. The second statement is 'Either the newspaper must be sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway'. This is a logical disjunction, which means that one of two things must be true: either the newspaper is on the porch, or it is in the driveway. Since we already know from the first statement that it doesn't have to be on the porch, the only other option left is that it is in the driveway.\n\n3.
