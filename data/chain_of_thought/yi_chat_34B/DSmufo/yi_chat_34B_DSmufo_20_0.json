We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n   - \"Either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag.\"\n\n2. The first statement tells us that the sunglasses do not have to be perched on her head, which means it is possible for them to be somewhere else.\n\n3. The second statement presents a logical disjunction: either the sunglasses are perched on her head or they are in her bag. Since we know from the first statement that they are not necessarily perched on her head, the only other option left is that they are in her bag.\n\n4. Therefore, based on these two statements together, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
