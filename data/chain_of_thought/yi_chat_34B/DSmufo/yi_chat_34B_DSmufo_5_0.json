We are given two premises:\n   - It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry (Premise 1).\n   - Either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar (Premise 2).\n\n2. Premise 1 tells us that the cookies do not have to be hidden in the pantry, which means it is possible for them to be somewhere else.\n\n3. Premise 2 gives us a logical disjunction: The cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar. This means that one of these two options must be true.\n\n4. Since we know from Premise 1 that the cookies do not have to be in the pantry, and Premise 2 tells us that exactly one of the options is true, it follows that the cookies must be in the jar.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the given premises, we can infer 'The cookies are in the jar'.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n",
