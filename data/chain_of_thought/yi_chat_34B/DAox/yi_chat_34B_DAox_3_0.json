It did not undergo any transformation or process that would change its nature or appearance.\n\n2. \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\" This is a conditional statement that tells us if the splat were to be morphed (which we now know from the first statement did not happen), it would have resulted in the splat quanking. However, since the splat was not morphed, this condition never came into effect.\n\n3. We are asked to infer whether \"The splat did not quank.\" Based on the information provided, we can conclude that since the splat was not morphed (which is a necessary condition for it to quank according to the second statement), then indeed the splat did not quank.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
