If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the fribble was not in a state of being snurgled. This means that whatever conditions or consequences are associated with being snurgled do not apply to the fribble.\n\nStatement 2 is an if-then statement, which in this case means that if the fribble were to be snurgled, it would also crink. However, since we know from statement 1 that the fribble was not snurgled, we cannot apply the consequence of the if-then statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided by both statements, we can infer that:\n\n3. The fribble did not crink.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END",
