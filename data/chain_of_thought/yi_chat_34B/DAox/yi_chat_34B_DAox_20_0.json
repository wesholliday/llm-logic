If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the fleeg was not in a state of being bluttered. This means that the condition described in statement 2 (\"If the fleeg was bluttered\") is not met. Since the condition is not met, we cannot apply the logical consequence stated in the same sentence, which is \"then it surned.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided by both statements, we can infer that:\n\n- The fleeg was not bluttered (statement 1).\n- Because the fleeg was not bluttered, the condition for it to surn (as stated in statement 2) does not apply.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
