It means that if the first condition (clug being fleeked) is true, then the second condition (clug snugging) must also be true.\n\nNow, given that we know \"The clug was not fleeked,\" we can deduce that the antecedent of the conditional statement is false. In a valid conditional, if the antecedent is false, the entire conditional is considered to be true (because it's as if saying \"If something that isn't true, then this other thing happens\" which doesn't make sense logically). However, we cannot directly infer the truth value of the consequent (whether the clug snugged or not) from just these two statements.\n\nTherefore, based on the information",
