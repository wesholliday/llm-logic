However, since we know from statement 1 that A (sploffing) did not happen, we cannot conclude that B (plopping the frink) happened.\n\nBased on these two statements alone, we cannot infer whether the grommet plopped the frink or not. The first statement only tells us that the grommet didn't sploff, which means we don't have enough information to determine if it plopped the frink or not.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n",
