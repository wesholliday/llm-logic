Since the glip was not slogged, according to the conditional in statement 2, the glip would not have been tragged either.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided by both statements, we can infer that:\n\n3. \"The glip was not tragged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
