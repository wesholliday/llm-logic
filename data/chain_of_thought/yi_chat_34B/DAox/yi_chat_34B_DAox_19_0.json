If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk would have plagged.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the smonk is not in a state of being vreebled. Since statement 2 tells us that if the smonk were vreebled, it would also be plagged, we can infer that since the smonk is not vreebled, it must not be plagged as well.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can conclude that 'The smonk was not plagged'.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
