If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the flug was not in a state of being blummed. Statement 2 tells us that if the flug were to be in a state of being blummed, it would also be in a state of being zimmed. However, since we already know from statement 1 that the flug is not blummed, we cannot infer anything about whether the flug was zimmed or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot conclude that 'The flug was not zimmed'.<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: no<|im_end|>\n\n",
