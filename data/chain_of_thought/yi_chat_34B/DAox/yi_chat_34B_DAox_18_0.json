If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged. This is a conditional statement that tells us what would happen if the first statement were false (i.e., if the shank were plooked).\n\nNow, since we know from the first statement that the shank was not plooked, we can conclude that the condition of the second statement (the shank being plooked) is not met. Therefore, according to the second statement's conditional logic, the shank not being plooked means it also was not nugged.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n",
