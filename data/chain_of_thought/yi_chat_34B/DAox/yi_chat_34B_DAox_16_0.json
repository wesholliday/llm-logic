If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the sneg was not in a state of being crampled. Since the condition in statement 2 (\"If the sneg was crampled\") is not met (because the sneg was not crampled), we cannot infer the consequence stated in the same sentence (\"the sneg sproted the frink\").\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot conclude that the sneg did not sprot the frink. The only thing we can be certain of is that the sneg was not crampled.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>",
