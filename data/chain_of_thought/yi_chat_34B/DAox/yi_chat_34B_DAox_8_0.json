However, since we know from the first statement that the sprocket was not cranked, this condition does not apply.\n\n3. We are asked to infer whether \"The sprocket was not daggled.\" Since the sprocket was not cranked (which is the only way for it to be daggled according to the conditional statement), we can conclude that the sprocket was indeed not daggled.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n",
