It could be any other color.\n\n2. If the car was red, then the truck was blue. This is a conditional statement where the color of the truck (blue) is contingent on the color of the car being red.\n\nNow, since we know from statement 1 that the car is not red, we can conclude that the condition for the truck to be blue (as stated in statement 2) does not hold. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty whether the truck was blue or not based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[SYS]No<|im_end|>\n",
