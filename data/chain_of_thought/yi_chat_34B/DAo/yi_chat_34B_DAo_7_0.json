Since we know that Alex did not finish the race, the condition for this conditional statement is false.\n\n3. When the condition of a conditional statement is false, the entire statement is considered true regardless of the truth value of the consequent. This means that even though 'Alex finished the race' is false, the whole 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' is still considered true because the condition (Alex finishing) did not happen.\n\n4. However, this does not necessarily mean that we can infer 'Chris did not finish the race' from the given information. The only thing we know for sure about Chris is that if Alex had finished, then Chris would have too. But since Alex did not finish, we cannot conclude anything definitive about Chris'",
