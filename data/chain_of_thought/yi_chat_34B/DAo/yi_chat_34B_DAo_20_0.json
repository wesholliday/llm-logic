If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. This is a conditional statement where the color of the banana (yellow) is contingent on the color of the apple (red).\n\nNow, since we know from statement 1 that the apple was not red, we can conclude that the condition for the banana to be yellow (as stated in the second sentence) does not hold. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty whether the banana was or was not yellow based solely on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[SYS]No<|im_end|>\n",
