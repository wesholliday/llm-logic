The alien did not visit Mars. This is an established fact.\n2. If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. This is a conditional statement where 'the alien visiting Mars' is the condition (antecedent) and 'the robot visiting Jupiter' is the consequence (consequent).\n\nNow, since we know that the alien did not visit Mars, the condition for the robot to visit Jupiter never occurred. In other words, because the antecedent of the conditional statement is false, the consequent does not have to be true. This principle is known as 'modus tollens' in logic: from 'If A then B' and 'not A', we can infer 'not B'.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can indeed infer that since the alien did not visit Mars, the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Explanation complete.<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Thank you for your question!
