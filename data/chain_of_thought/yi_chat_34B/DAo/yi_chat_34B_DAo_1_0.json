We know that Mary was not at the wedding.\n2. If Mary had been at the wedding, then Sue would have been there too (this is the conditional statement provided).\n\nNow, since we know that Mary was not at the wedding, we can conclude from point 2 that Sue is not necessarily at the wedding because the condition for her presence (Mary being present) did not occur. However, this does not directly tell us whether Sue was or was not at the wedding; it only tells us that if Mary's absence is true, then Sue's presence cannot be inferred from the given information.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively infer whether Sue was at the wedding or not. We can only say that because Mary was not present, we cannot use the conditional statement to determine Sue's attendance.<|im_end|>\n[ANSWER]Answer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[THINK]To determine whether we can infer that Sue was not at the wedding from the given information, let's consider the statements",
