            "content": "[SYS]To determine whether we can infer that the mummy was not awake from the given statements, let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. The vampire was not awake. This is a fact.\n2. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This is a conditional statement where 'if A, then B' can be represented as A \u2192 B in symbolic form.\n\nNow, we have two possibilities:\n\n- Either the vampire is awake (A), or the vampire is not awake (\u00acA).\n\nIf the vampire is awake (A):\n  - According to the conditional statement, if A is true, then B must also be true. So, if the vampire is awake, the mummy would also be awake (B).\n\nHowever, we know that the vampire was not awake (\u00acA), which means:\n  - The condition for the mummy to be awake (B) does not hold because A is not true.\n\nTherefore, since the vampire was not awake (\u00acA) and A \u2192 B, we can infer that B (the mummy being awake) is also not true.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>",
