This means that the cake is either vanilla or some other flavor, but not chocolate.\n2. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. This is a conditional statement where \"the cake being chocolate\" is the condition (antecedent) and \"the muffins being blueberry\" is the consequence (consequent).\n\nNow, since we know that the cake is not chocolate (from statement 1), we can conclude that the condition for the muffins to be blueberry (statement 2) does not hold. Therefore, the consequent (the muffins being blueberry) does not necessarily follow.\n\nTo infer whether the muffins were not blueberry, we would need additional information about the flavor of the muffins or a different statement that directly relates to the muffins' flavor. Based on the information provided, we cannot definitively say that the muffins were not blueberry; we can only say that the condition for them to be blueberry (the cake being chocolate) is not met.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP",
