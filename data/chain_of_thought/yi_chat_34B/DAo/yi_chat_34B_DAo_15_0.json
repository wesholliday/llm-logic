The first statement is \"Sam did not take a plane.\" This means that Sam either took another mode of transportation or did not travel at all.\n\n2. The second statement is \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This is a conditional statement where the taking of a plane by Sam is the condition for Erin to take a train.\n\nNow, since we know that Sam did not take a plane (as per the first statement), the condition for Erin to take a train as stated in the second statement does not hold true. Therefore, we cannot infer from the given information that Erin took a train.\n\nHowever, what we can conclude is that because Sam did not take a plane and if taking a plane by Sam was the only condition for Erin to take a train, then it follows that since Sam did not take a plane, Erin did not take a train either.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[THINK]To determine whether we can infer that Erin did not take a train from the",
