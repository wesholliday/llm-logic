If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. This is a conditional statement where 'the bear being in the cave' is the condition (antecedent) and 'the wolf being in the den' is the consequence (consequent).\n\nNow, since we know that the bear was not in the cave, we can conclude that the condition for the second statement (the bear being in the cave) did not occur. Therefore, according to the conditional statement, the consequent (the wolf being in the den) also does not occur.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes",
