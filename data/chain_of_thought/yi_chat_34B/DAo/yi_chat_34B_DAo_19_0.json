            "content": "[THINK]To determine whether we can infer that Jen did not watch basketball from the given information, let's break down the statements and analyze them logically.\n\n1. The first statement is \"Tom did not watch football.\" This means that Tom's action (or inaction) with regards to watching football is clear: he did not do it.\n\n2. The second statement is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement where the condition (antecedent) is \"Tom watched football,\" and the consequence (consequent) is \"Jen watched basketball.\" However, since we know from the first statement that Tom did not watch football, this conditional statement does not provide any information about whether Jen watched basketball or not.\n\n3. The third statement we need to infer is \"Jen did not watch basketball.\" To make this inference, we would need additional information that directly relates to Jen's actions or inactions regarding watching basketball. Since the provided statements do not give us such information, we cannot definitively conclude whether Jen watched basketball or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information alone, we cannot infer that \"Jen did not watch basketball.",
