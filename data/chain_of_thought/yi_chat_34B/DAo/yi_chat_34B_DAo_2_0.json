If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. This is a conditional statement that tells us something about what would be true if the first statement were false (i.e., if the griffin *were* in the forest).\n\nNow, since we know from the first statement that the griffin is not in the forest, we can conclude that the condition for the second statement (the griffin being in the forest) is not met. Therefore, according to the second statement, which is a conditional \"If A then B\" statement, we cannot infer anything about the unicorn's location since the condition 'A' (griffin in the forest) is not true.\n\nIn other words, because the griffin is not in the forest, we do not have enough information to determine whether the unicorn was in the forest or not. The second statement only tells us what would be true if the first statement were false, but since it is",
