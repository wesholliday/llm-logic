This means that if A is true, then C must be true as well.\n\n2. \"Chris might not have finished the face\" suggests that C could be false. Since the statement in point 1 is a conditional where the consequent (C) depends on the antecedent (A) being true, and we now know that the consequent (C) might be false, it implies that the antecedent (A) might also be false.\n\n3. To infer 'Alex did not finish the race' (which is the negation of A), we would need to establish with certainty that C is false and then use the contrapositive of the conditional statement in point 1, which states that if C is false, then A must also be false.\n\nHowever, we are only told that \"Chris might not have finished the face\" (which means C could be true or false",
