This is a conditional statement where \"James wrote the book\" is the condition (P) and \"the book is a mystery novel\" is the consequence (Q). We can represent this as P \u2192 Q.\n\n2. The second statement says that the book might not be a mystery novel. This suggests that the consequence (Q) may not be true, but it does not necessarily mean that the condition (P) is false. It's possible that the book could be written by someone else who doesn't write mystery novels, or that there are other factors at play.\n\n3. To infer \"The book was not written by James\" from these two statements would require us to assume that because the consequence (Q) might not be true, the condition (P) must be false. However, this is not a valid inference without additional information. We cannot definitively say that just because the book might not be a mystery novel, it was not written by James.\n\n4. For example, consider the following possibilities:\n   - The book could have been written by someone other",
