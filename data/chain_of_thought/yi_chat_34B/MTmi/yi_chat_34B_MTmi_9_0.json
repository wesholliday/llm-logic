            "content": "\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\"\n2. The condition (antecedent) in this statement is \"Lisa bought the red shirt,\" and the consequence (consequent) is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n3. The second statement, \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt,\" suggests that the consequent of the conditional statement may not be true.\n4. If the consequent is not true (i.e., Mark did not buy the blue shirt), then the conditional statement itself is false because its condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) would not lead to the stated consequence (Mark buying the blue shirt).\n5. Therefore, if we know that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, which makes the conditional statement false, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt since that is the condition that must be true for the original conditional statement to be true.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
