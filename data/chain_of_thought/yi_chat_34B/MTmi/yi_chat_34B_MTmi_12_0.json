It can be represented as A \u2192 B, where A = Joe went to the park and B = Lucy went to the zoo.\n\n2. \"Lucy might not have gone to the zoo.\" This statement suggests that it's possible for Lucy not to have gone to the zoo, but it does not provide any information about whether or not Joe went to the park. It can be represented as \u00acB (not B), where B = Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nNow, let's consider what we can infer from these two statements:\n\n- If A \u2192 B is true and \u00acB is true, then by contraposition, we can conclude that \u00acA must be true. Contraposition states that if A \u2192 B is true, then so is \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA. However, we only know that it's",
