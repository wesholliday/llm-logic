            "content": "[RESP]Let's break down the information given step by step:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This is a conditional statement that tells us that if Mary's presence at the wedding is true, then Sue's presence is also true. It does not specify whether either of them actually was at the wedding.\n\n2. Sue might not have been at the wedding. This tells us that there is a possibility that Sue was not present at the wedding, but it does not provide any information about Mary's attendance.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information alone, we cannot definitively infer whether Mary was or was not at the wedding. The first statement only establishes a condition for Sue's presence if Mary were to be there; it does not rule out the possibility that both Mary and Sue could have been absent. The second statement about Sue being absent is a separate piece of information that does not necessarily contradict the first statement because it does not specify whether Mary was present or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer with certainty that 'Mary was not at the wedding'. There are too many possibilities left open by the given statements: Mary",
