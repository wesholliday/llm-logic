It can be represented as A \u2192 B, where A is 'vampire awake' and B is 'mummy awake'.\n\n2. \"The mummy might not have been awake.\" This tells us that the second condition (B: mummy awake) may not be true.\n\nNow, we are asked if we can infer \"The vampire was not awake\" from these two statements. To answer this, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n- If A is true (vampire awake), then B must also be true (mummy awake) according to our first statement. However, since the second statement says that B might not be true, this scenario seems unlikely.\n\n- If A is not true (vampire not awake), then we cannot determine the truth of B from our first statement alone. The second statement does not affect this scenario because it only",
