It can be represented as A \u2192 B, where A is 'cake is chocolate' and B is 'muffins are blueberry'.\n\n2. \"The muffins might not have been blueberry.\" This statement suggests that it is possible for the muffins not to be blueberry, which means the condition (A) does not necessarily lead to the outcome (B).\n\nNow, let's consider what we can infer from these statements:\n\n- If A \u2192 B and not B, then we can conclude not A. This is because if the consequence (B) does not happen, then the condition (A) cannot be true.\n\nHowever, the second statement only tells us that B might not have been true, which means it's possible for both A and B to be false. In other words, the cake might not be chocolate, and the muffins might not be blueberry.\n\nTherefore,",
