It does not necessarily mean that the apple *was* red; it's just a hypothetical situation.\n\n2. \"The banana might not have been yellow.\" This statement suggests that despite the first statement, there is a possibility that the banana was not yellow after all. This creates a tension between the two statements because if the condition (apple being red) were true, then the banana would be yellow, but we're told it might not be.\n\nNow, to infer whether \"The apple was not red\" from these two statements, we need to consider that the first statement is conditional and does not guarantee that the apple *was* red; it only says if it were red, then the banana would be yellow. Since the second statement suggests that the banana might not have been yellow despite the condition possibly being met (apple being red), we cannot definitively say that \"The apple was not red\" because there is no information provided about whether",
