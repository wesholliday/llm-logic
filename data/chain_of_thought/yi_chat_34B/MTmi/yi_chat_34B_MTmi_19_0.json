It establishes a necessary condition; if Tom watched football, then Jen's action of watching basketball is guaranteed to follow.\n\n2. **Jen might not have watched basketball.** This statement provides us with a possibility that contradicts the consequent of the conditional statement. If it is true that Jen might not have watched basketball, then the condition (Tom watching football) cannot be met, because the consequent (Jen watching basketball) is not guaranteed.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can conclude:\n\n3. **Answer:** No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[THINK]To determine whether we can infer that Tom did not watch football, let's consider the statements provided step by step:\n\n1. **If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.** This is a conditional statement where watching football (Tom) is the ant",
