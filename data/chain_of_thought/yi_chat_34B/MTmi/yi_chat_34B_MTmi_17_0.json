In logical notation, this would be represented as P \u2192 Q.\n\n2. \"Kate might not have eaten salad.\" This suggests that the second part of the conditional statement (Q) may not be true. If Kate did not eat salad, then the conditional statement itself is false because it states that if P (Ben eats pasta), then Q (Kate eats salad) must also happen.\n\n3. Since we know that \"Kate might not have eaten salad\" and this contradicts the consequent of the conditional statement (P \u2192 Q), we can conclude that the entire conditional statement is false. This means that both P (Ben eating pasta) and Q (Kate eating salad) cannot be true simultaneously.\n\n4. If the conditional statement is false, then it must be because",
