In other words, there are other options available for the sprocket besides being daggled.\n\n2. \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled.\" This statement presents two alternatives: The sprocket can either be in a state of being cranked, or it must be daggled. It implies that one of these conditions has to be true.\n\nNow, combining both statements, we have:\n\n- The sprocket does not necessarily have to be daggled.\n- Either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled (but since it doesn't have to be daggled, the only option left is that it is cranked).\n\nTherefore, based on these two statements together, we can infer:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Yes<|im_end|>\n",
