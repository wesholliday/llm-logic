Since we already know from the first statement that it's not mandatory to spend the dreb, this means that if one of the two options has to be true, then the dreb must be vroombed (since spending it is not required).\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can infer:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: no<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: no<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: no<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: no<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n",
