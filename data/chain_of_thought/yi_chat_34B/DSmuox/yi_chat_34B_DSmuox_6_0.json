There are no other options given.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer the following:\n\n- If the grommet must not be plopped, then it must be in a state where it is either already sploffed or it doesn't need to be plopped at all (based on statement 1).\n\n- According to statement 2, the grommet is either sploffed or it must be plopped. Since we know from statement 1 that it does not have to be plopped, then by process of elimination, the only remaining",
