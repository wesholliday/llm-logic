In other words, there are situations where the flug can exist without being zimmed.\n\n2. \"Either the flug is blummed or it must be zimmed.\" This is an example of the logical principle of the excluded middle, which states that a proposition is either true or false, and in this case, it must be one or the other: the flug is blummed or it must be zimmed.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer the following:\n\n- If the flug is not required to be zimmed (according to statement 1), then the only remaining option for the excluded middle (statement 2) is that the flug is blummed.\n\nTherefore, based on the logic provided, we can conclude that:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Yes<|im_end|>\n",
