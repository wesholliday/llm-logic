In other words, the clug can exist without being snugged.\n\n2. \"Either the clug is fleeked or it must be snugged\" is a disjunction, meaning that one of two conditions must be true: either the clug is fleeked, or it must be snugged. Since we already know from statement 1 that the clug does not need to be snugged, this disjunction tells us that if the clug is not snugged, then it must be fleeked (because those are the only two options given).\n\nGiven these two statements together, we can infer:\n\n3. \"The clug is fleeked\" because there is no other option presented that does not involve the clug being snugged, and we know from statement 1 that it's not snugged.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Yes<|im_end|>\n",
