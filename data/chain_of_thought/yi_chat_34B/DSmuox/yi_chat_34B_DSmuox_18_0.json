'It's not the case that the shank must be nugged.' This means that being nugged is not a necessary condition for the shank. In other words, the shank does not have to be nugged.\n\n2. 'Either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged.' This is an example of the logical principle of the excluded middle, which states that a proposition is either true or false. In this case, the shank is either plooked or it must be nugged (and since we already know from statement 1 that it doesn't have to be nugged, this means it must be plooked).\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that 'The shank is plooked' because the only other option ('It must be nugged') has been ruled out by the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Yes<|im_end|>\n",
