In other words, it is possible for the smonk to exist without being plagged.\n\n2. \"Either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged\" presents two alternatives: The smonk is either vreebled, or it must be plagged (but not both, since 'or' is used in an exclusive sense).\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that if the smonk is not required to be plagged and it cannot simultaneously be vreebled and plagged, then the only remaining possibility is that the smonk is vreebled. This is because the statement says \"either ... or\" which means one of the two conditions must be true, and since we've established that it's not necessarily plagged, the only option left is for it to be vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Yes<|im_end|>\n",
