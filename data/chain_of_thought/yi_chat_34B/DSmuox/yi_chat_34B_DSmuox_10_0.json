In other words, the wug can exist without being garpled.\n\n2. \"Either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled.\" This is an example of the logical principle of the excluded middle, which states that a proposition is either true or false. According to this statement, the wug is in one of two states: sproinged or garpled.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that since it's not mandatory for the wug to be garpled, and it must be in one of the two states (sproinged or garpled), then the only remaining option is that the wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Explanation: Since the wug can exist without being garpled (as per the first statement) and it must be in one of two states (sproinged or garpled, as per the second statement)",
