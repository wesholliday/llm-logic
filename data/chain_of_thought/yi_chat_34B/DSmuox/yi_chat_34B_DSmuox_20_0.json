In other words, the fleeg does not have to be surned.\n\n2. \"Either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned.\" This is an exclusive disjunction, meaning that the fleeg cannot be both bluttered and surned at the same time. It also implies that if the fleeg is not surned (as per the first statement), then it must be bluttered.\n\nGiven these two statements together, we can infer:\n\n3. \"The fleeg is bluttered.\" This is because if being surned is not a necessary condition for the fleeg, and if the fleeg is either bluttered or surned (but not both), then the only option left is that the fleeg is bluttered since we already know it's not surned.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END",
