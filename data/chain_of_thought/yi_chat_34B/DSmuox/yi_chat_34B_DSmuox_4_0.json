In other words, the fribble can exist without being crinked.\n\n2. \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked.\" This is a logical statement that presents two alternatives: The fribble is either snurgled, or it must be crinked (but not both, since 'or' is used in the exclusive sense).\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer the following:\n\n- If the fribble is not crinked (which is allowed by statement 1), then it must be snurgled, according to statement 2.\n\nHowever, there is a caveat: Just because the fribble doesn't have to be crinked doesn't necessarily mean that it isn't crinked. It could still be both snurgled and crinked, but the information provided does not allow us to determine",
