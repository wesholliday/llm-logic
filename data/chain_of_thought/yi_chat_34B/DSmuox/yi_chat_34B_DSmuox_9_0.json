However, we know from statement 1 that it's not the case that the twonk must be plinked.\n\nSince we have established that the twonk does not need to be plinked, and given that one of the two conditions in the disjunction must be true, the only remaining option is that the twonk is varnished. Therefore, based on these two statements alone, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n",
