'It's not the case that the glip must be tragged.' This means that being tragged is not a necessary condition for the glip. In other words, it is possible for the glip to exist without being tragged.\n\n2. 'Either the glip is slogged or it must be tragged.' This is an example of the logical principle of the excluded middle, which states that for any proposition, it must be true either in whole or in part. In this case, it suggests that the glip is either slogged or tragged, but not both (since 'must be tragged' implies not being slogged).\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that if the glip is not tragged (as per the first statement), then it must be slogged (as per the second statement). However, this inference assumes that there are only two possibilities: being slogged or being tragged. If there were other possible states for the glip, we would need to consider those as well before",
