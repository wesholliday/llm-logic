'It's not the case that the splat must be quanked.' This means that being quanked is not a necessary condition for the splat. In other words, the splat does not have to be quanked.\n\n2. 'Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked.' This is an exclusive disjunction, meaning that only one of two conditions can be true: either the splat is morphed, or it must be quanked (but not both).\n\nNow, since we know from statement 1 that the splat does not have to be quanked, and given the exclusivity of the disjunction in statement 2, we can conclude that if the splat is not going to be quanked, it must be morphed (because those are the only two options presented).\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer 'The splat is morphed' from the given statements.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|><|im_end|>\n[RE",
