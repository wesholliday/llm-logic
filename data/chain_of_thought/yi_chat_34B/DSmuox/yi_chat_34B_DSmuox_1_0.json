In other words, there are situations where the flugel can exist without being zargled.\n\n2. \"Either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled.\" This is an exclusive disjunction, meaning that the flugel cannot be both blimmed and zargled at the same time. It also implies that if the flugel is not zargled (as per the first statement), then it must be blimmed.\n\nGiven these two statements together:\n\n- We know that the flugel does not have to be zargled.\n- We also know that if it's not zargled, it must be blimmed.\n\nSince we've established that it's not zargled (based on the first statement), we can conclude that:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Yes<|im_end|>\n",
