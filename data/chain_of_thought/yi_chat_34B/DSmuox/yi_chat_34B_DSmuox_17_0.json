However, if the flob is skizzled, then there is no need for it to be movated because one condition (being skizzled) satisfies the \"either/or\" proposition.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer:\n\n- If the flob is not skizzled, then it must be movated (according to statement 2).\n- But since we know that it's not mandatory for the flob to be movated (statement 1), this means that the flob cannot be both not skizzled and not movated at the same time.\n\nTherefore, the only logical conclusion is",
