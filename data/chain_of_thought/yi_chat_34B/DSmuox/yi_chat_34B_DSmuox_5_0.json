The disjunction does not require exclusivity; it simply states that one of the conditions must hold true.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[SYS]No, we cannot infer \"The zinger is fraggled\" from the given statements because the second statement allows for the possibility that the zinger might be both fraggled and smoogled, or just smoogled without being fraggled.
