It establishes a relationship between Sue's choice and Bob's choice. If the first part (Sue choosing pizza) is true, then the second part (Bob choosing pasta) must also be true.\n\nGiven that we know \"Sue chose pizza,\" which satisfies the condition of the conditional statement, we can conclude that:\n\n3. \"Bob chose pasta\" - This is the logical consequence of the previous two statements. Since Sue did choose pizza, according to the conditional, Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response. Thank you for your question.
