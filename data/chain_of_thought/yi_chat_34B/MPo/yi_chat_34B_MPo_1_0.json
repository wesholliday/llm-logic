It can be represented as: If P (Mary at the wedding), then Q (Sue at the wedding).\n\nNow, since we know that 'P' (Mary at the wedding) is true, according to the conditional statement, 'Q' (Sue at the wedding) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the logical relationship between Mary and Sue's attendance at the wedding, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
