We are given two statements:\n   - \"Joe went to the park.\" (Statement A)\n   - \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" (Statement B)\n\n2. Statement B is a conditional statement, which means it follows the rules of logic for such statements. A conditional statement can be written in if-then form: If P, then Q, where P is the hypothesis and Q is the conclusion.\n\n3. In this case, P (the hypothesis) is \"Joe went to the park,\" and Q (the conclusion) is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\n4. For a conditional statement to be true, the following must be true: If P is true, then Q must also be true. However, if P is false, the truth of Q does not need to be considered.\n\n5. We are told that Statement A (P) is true (Joe went to the park).\n\n6. Therefore, according to the rules of a conditional statement, since P is true, Q must also be true.\n\n7. Thus, we can infer from the",
