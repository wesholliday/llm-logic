The apple was red.\n2. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the apple has a certain color: red. This does not provide any information about the banana's color.\n\nFrom statement 2, we have a conditional statement. A conditional statement is in the form \"If P, then Q\" where P is the hypothesis and Q is the conclusion. The meaning of such a statement is that if the hypothesis (P) is true, then the conclusion (Q) must also be true.\n\nNow, let's combine both statements. Since we know from statement 1 that the apple is red, this satisfies the hypothesis (P) in statement 2. According to the rules of a conditional statement, if the hypothesis is true, then the conclusion (Q) must also be true. Therefore, since the apple is red, we can infer that the banana was indeed yellow as stated in the conclusion of the conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS",
