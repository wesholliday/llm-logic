It means that if the first condition (Tom watching football) is true, then the second condition (Jen watching basketball) must also be true.\n\nTo infer whether 'Jen watched basketball', we need to determine if the first condition ('Tom watched football') is true. If it is true, then according to the conditional statement, 'Jen watched basketball' must also be true. However, without additional information confirming that Tom did indeed watch football, we cannot definitively conclude that Jen watched basketball.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer with certainty that 'Jen watched basketball'.<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: no<|im_end|>\n\n",
