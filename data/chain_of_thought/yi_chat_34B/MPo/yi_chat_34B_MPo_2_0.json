This means that if the first statement (the griffin being in the forest) is true, then the second statement (the unicorn being in the forest) must also be true.\n3. Since we know that the first statement is true (the griffin is in the forest), according to the conditional statement, the second statement (the unicorn being in the forest) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the logical relationship between the two statements, we can infer that \"The unicorn was in the forest\".<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
