            "content": "[SYS]To determine if we can infer that the mummy was awake from the information provided, let's consider the statements step by step:\n\n1. The vampire was awake.\n2. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the vampire is awake.\n\nNow, statement 2 introduces a conditional relationship. In this case, the condition (the hypothesis) is 'The vampire was awake' and the consequence (the conclusion) is 'The mummy was awake'. Since we already have evidence that the condition is true (from statement 1), we can apply the logical principle of modus ponens, which states that if a conditional statement is true and its antecedent is true, then its consequent must also be true.\n\nTherefore, given the truth of 'The vampire was awake' and the rule 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake,' we can indeed infer that 'The mummy was awake.'\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Explanation: The statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' is a conditional statement, which in classical logic",
