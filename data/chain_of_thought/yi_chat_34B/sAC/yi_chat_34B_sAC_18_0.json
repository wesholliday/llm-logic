We are told two things:\n\n1. If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal (conditional statement in the form of an if-then statement).\n2. The truck was metal (this is a factual statement).\n\nWe also know that when a conditional statement is true and its consequent (the part after 'then') is true, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (the part before 'then') is true. In other words, just because the truck being metal is true and it implies that the doll being plastic would make the entire conditional statement true, we cannot conclude that the doll itself is plastic.\n\nFor example, consider this scenario: The doll could be made of wood, but if someone were to say 'If the doll was plastic, then the sky is blue,' and you know that the sky is blue, it does not mean that the doll is plastic; it just means that the conditional statement is true because the consequent (the sky being blue) is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we",
