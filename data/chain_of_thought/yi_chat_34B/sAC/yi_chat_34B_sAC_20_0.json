            "content": "[THINK]To determine whether 'The apple was red' is true, we need to consider the given statements logically. We are told that 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' is true, which means that if we assume the antecedent (the part before the 'then') to be true, the consequent (the part after the 'then') must also be true. This is a conditional statement represented as A \u2192 B, where A is 'The apple was red' and B is 'The banana was yellow'.\n\nWe are also told that 'The banana was yellow' is true, which confirms the truth of one half of the conditional statement (the consequent). However, the truth of the consequent does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent in a conditional statement. For example, consider the following logically equivalent statement: 'If it is raining, then the grass is wet'. If we know that the grass is wet, this does not mean that it must be raining; it could be due to other reasons (like watering the grass).\n\nIn our case, knowing that the banana was yellow tells us that the conditional statement A \u2192 B is true, but it does",
