This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as Mary --> Sue (where '-->' means 'implies').\n\n2. The second piece of information we have is that \"Sue was at the wedding\" is true. This is a factual statement about Sue's attendance.\n\nNow, we need to determine if it follows that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true. To do this, we can use the transitive property of logic, which states that if A implies B and B is true, then A must also be true. However, this only applies when all three statements are true.\n\nIn our case:\n- The condition (A) is \"Mary was at the wedding.\"\n- The result (B) is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n- The conditional statement (C) is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nWe know that C is true (given) and B is true (also given).",
