            "content": "\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two pieces of information:\n   - \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" (conditional statement in the form of an if-then statement)\n   - \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" (consequent of the conditional statement)\n\n2. The second piece of information confirms that the consequent of the conditional statement is true.\n\n3. To determine whether Lisa bought the red shirt, we need to consider the antecedent of the conditional statement: \"Lisa bought the red shirt.\"\n\n4. In a valid conditional statement, if the consequent is true, then the antecedent must also be true for the conditional to be true.\n\n5. Since we know that Mark bought the blue shirt (the consequent) and the conditional statement is true, it follows that Lisa must have bought the red shirt (the antecedent) for the condition to be met.\n\n6. Therefore, if \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true, then \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
