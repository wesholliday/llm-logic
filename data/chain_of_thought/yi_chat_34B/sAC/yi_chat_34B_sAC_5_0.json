We are told two things:\n\n1. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis (conditional statement).\n2. Amy played tennis (consequent of the conditional statement).\n\nFrom these two pieces of information, we can infer that since the consequent is true (Amy played tennis), the conditional statement must be true as well. This is because in a valid conditional statement, if the consequent is true, the entire conditional (the antecedent and the consequent together) is true.\n\nHowever, the truth of the conditional statement alone does not guarantee that the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) is also true. The conditional could be true because the antecedent is true, but it could also be true for other reasons. For example, there might be another condition or assumption that makes the entire statement true without Jeff actually playing basketball.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively conclude that 'Jeff played basketball' is true. We can only say that it is consistent with the truth of the conditional and the consequ",
