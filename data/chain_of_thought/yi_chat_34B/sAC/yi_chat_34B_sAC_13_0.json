We are told that 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' is true, which means that if we assume the car was red, the statement 'The truck was blue' would be a logical consequence. We are also told that 'The truck was blue' is true, which confirms the truth of one part of the conditional statement. However, the truth of 'The truck was blue' does not necessarily imply that 'The car was red' because it could be that some other condition (not mentioned in our knowledge) would make 'The truck was blue' true without 'The car was red' being true. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot conclude with certainty that 'The car was red' is true.<|im_end|>\n[ANSWER]Answer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[THINK]To determine whether 'The car was red' is true, we need to consider the given statements logically.
