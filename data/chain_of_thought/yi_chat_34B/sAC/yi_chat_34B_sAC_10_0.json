This means that if the condition (the dog being inside) is met, it implies that the consequence (the cat being outside) must also be true.\n\nWe are also told that 'The cat was outside' is true. Since this statement aligns with the consequence of the first statement, we can infer that the condition (the dog being inside) must have been met for the cat to be outside.
