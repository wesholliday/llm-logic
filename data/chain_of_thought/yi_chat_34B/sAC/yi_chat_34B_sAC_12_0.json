We are given two pieces of information:\n   - \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" (conditional statement)\n   - \"Lucy went to the zoo\" (consequent of the conditional statement)\n\n2. The first piece of information is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Joe going to the park) is true, then the consequent (Lucy going to the zoo) must be true.\n\n3. We are also told that the second piece of information, \"Lucy went to the zoo,\" is true. This is the consequent of the conditional statement.\n\n4. Since the consequent (Lucy going to the zoo) is true, we can conclude that the antecedent (Joe going to the park) must also be true, because if it were false, the conditional statement would not hold true.\n\n5. Therefore, given that \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is true and the conditional statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is also true, we can conclude that \"Joe went to the park\" must be true",
