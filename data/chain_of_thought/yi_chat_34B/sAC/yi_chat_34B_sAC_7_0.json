We are told that 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' is true. This is a conditional statement where 'Alex finishing the race' is the antecedent (the part before the 'if') and 'Chris finishing the race' is the consequent (the part after the 'then').\n\n2. We are also told that 'Chris finished the race' is true. This is the truth of the consequent in the conditional statement.\n\n3. If both the antecedent and the consequent are true, then the conditional statement itself is considered true (because if you satisfy the condition, the result follows). However, we are not told that 'Alex finished the race' is true; we only know that it would imply that 'Chris finished the race' if it were true.\n\n4. Since we do not have information about whether Alex actually did finish the race, we cannot definitively conclude that 'Alex finished the race' is true based on the given information. The truth of 'Chris finishing the race' does not necessarily mean that",
