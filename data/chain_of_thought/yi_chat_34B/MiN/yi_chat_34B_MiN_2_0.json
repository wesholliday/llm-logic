It leaves open the possibility that the griffin could have been in the forest or could not have been.\n\nOn the other hand, \"It's not the case that\" followed by an affirmative statement (e.g., \"the griffin must have been in the forest\") would be logically equivalent to saying \"The griffin could not have been in the forest.\" This is because \"It's not the case that\" negates whatever comes after it.\n\nSince we are given a possibility (\"might not have been\") rather than a certainty, we cannot directly infer a categorical statement of impossibility (\"must not have been\"). The first statement allows for both possibilities (griffin being in the forest or not",
