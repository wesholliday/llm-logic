It leaves open the idea that the toy may or may not be in the toy box.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\": This statement asserts that being in the toy box is not a necessity, that there is no requirement for the toy to be in the toy box. It implies that the toy could be elsewhere or even not present at all.\n\nGiven these interpretations, we can see that \"The toy might not be in the toy box\" does indeed align with \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box.\" The first statement suggests a potential absence of the toy from the toy box, while the second statement denies any obligation for the toy to be present in the toy",
