            "content": "[SYS]To determine whether we can infer \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" from \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt,\" let's consider the meanings of these two statements:\n\n1. \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\": This means there is a possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. It implies that there is no certainty that she purchased it.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\": This statement directly negates the idea that Lisa was required to or definitely bought the red shirt.\n\nGiven these definitions, we can see that the second statement is a stronger version of the first. If there is a possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt (the first statement), then it logically follows that she does not have to have bought it (the second statement). Therefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" from \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Excellent! The inference is valid because the possibility of Lisa not buying the red shirt implies that it is not",
