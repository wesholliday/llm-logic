It leaves open the possibility that the pen could still be in the bag, albeit with some uncertainty.\n\nOn the other hand, \"It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag\" directly states that the pen is not required to be in the bag, implying that it is possible for the pen to not be in the bag.\n\nGiven these interpretations, we can see that there is a correspondence between the two statements. The first statement (\"The pen might not be in my bag\") implies that the pen could be out of the bag, which aligns with the second statement (\"It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag\"), which asserts that the pen does not have to be in the bag.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"",
