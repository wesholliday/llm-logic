We are given two premises:\n   - It's not the case that the cat must have been outside (Premise 1).\n   - If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside (Premise 2).\n\n2. Premise 1 tells us that the cat is not necessarily outside, which means it could be either inside or outside.\n\n3. Premise 2 introduces a conditional statement: if the dog was inside, then the cat would be outside. This does not tell us anything about the actual location of the dog or the cat; it's a hypothetical situation.\n\n4. To infer 'The dog was not inside' from these premises, we would need to find a contradiction in the original statements if we assume the dog was inside. However, Premise 2 does not provide such a contradiction because it only states what would be true if the dog were inside (the cat would be outside), but since we already know from Premise 1 that the cat is not necessarily outside, there is no logical conflict in assuming the dog could be inside and the cat could be either inside or outside.\n\n5.",
