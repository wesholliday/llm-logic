We are given two premises:\n   - It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow (Premise 1).\n   - If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow (Premise 2).\n\n2. Premise 1 tells us that it is possible for the banana to be something other than yellow. This means there are at least two possibilities for the color of the banana: yellow and some other color.\n\n3. Premise 2 gives us a conditional statement: if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. This means that when we combine Premise 1 with Premise 2, we can infer that since the banana is not necessarily yellow, the apple cannot be red, because if it were, the banana would have to be yellow by the condition given in Premise 2.\n\n4. Therefore, from the two premises provided, we can conclude that 'The apple was not red'.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n",
