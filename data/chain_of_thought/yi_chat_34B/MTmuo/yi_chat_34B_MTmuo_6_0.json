We are given two premises:\n   - Premise 1: It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.\n   - Premise 2: If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\n2. Premise 1 tells us that there is a possibility that Bob did not choose pasta.\n3. Premise 2 gives us a conditional statement where if Sue chooses pizza, it implies that Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\n4. However, since we know from Premise 1 that Bob might not have chosen pasta, the condition in Premise 2 (Sue choosing pizza) cannot be true, because if it were true, it would contradict Premise 1.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the information provided, Sue must not have chosen pizza in order for both premises to be consistent with each other.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
