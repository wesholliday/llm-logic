It does not necessarily mean that the unicorn was not in the forest, only that it's not a logical necessity.\n\n2. \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" This is an implication statement: if one thing is true (the griffin being in the forest), then another thing must also be true (the unicorn being in the forest).\n\nNow, let's consider what we can infer from these two statements:\n\n- If the first statement were true and the second statement were false, then we would have a situation where the unicorn is not necessarily in the forest but if the griffin were in the forest, the unicorn would still be there. This doesn't make sense because the first statement allows for the possibility of the unicorn not being in the forest.\n\n- If both statements are true, then we have a contradiction because the second",
