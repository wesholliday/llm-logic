In other words, the book may or may not be a mystery novel.\n   - The second premise states that if the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel. This means that if James wrote the book, it would necessarily be a mystery novel.\n\n2. We are asked to determine whether we can infer 'The book was not written by James' from these premises.\n\n3. To make this inference, we need to consider the possibilities:\n   - If the book is a mystery novel, then it could have been written by James (based on the second premise) or someone else.\n   - If the book is not a mystery novel, then it cannot be true that the book must be a mystery novel if James wrote it (because it would contradict the first premise).\n\n4. Therefore, since we know that the book may or may not be a mystery novel, and that if it were written by James, it would have to be a mystery novel, we can conclude that:\n   - If",
