It does not necessarily mean that the truck is not blue, but only that it is not required to be blue.\n\n2. \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\" This is an implication: if the car is red, then the truck has to be blue as well. However, this does not tell us anything about what happens when the truck is not blue.\n\nNow, let's try to infer something from these two statements:\n\n- If the truck must have been blue (which we know is not the case), and if the car being red would make that true (the truck being blue), then we could conclude that the car is not red.\n\nHowever, since we already know that it's not the case that the truck must be blue, this line of reasoning does not hold. The fact that the truck might not be blue does not necessarily mean that the car cannot be red, because there is no information given about what happens",
