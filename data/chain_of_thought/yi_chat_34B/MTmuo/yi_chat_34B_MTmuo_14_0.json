The first statement says 'It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den'. This means that the presence of the wolf in the den is not necessary or guaranteed. In other words, the wolf might or might not be in the den.\n\n2. The second statement provides a conditional: 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den'. This establishes a logical connection between the presence of the bear and the presence of the wolf. If the bear is in the cave, then the wolf has to be in the den as well.\n\n3. However, since we know from the first statement that the wolf might not be in the den (even if the bear is in the cave), this creates a logical tension. The conditional statement suggests that if the bear is in the cave, the wolf should be in the den, but we already know that the wolf's presence in the den is not certain.\n\n4. Therefore, to resolve this tension, we can infer that since the",
