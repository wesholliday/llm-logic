However, the only information given is that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. Since we already know from statement 1 that it is possible for Jen not to have watched basketball, this does not necessarily mean that Tom did not watch football. It could very well be the case that Tom watched football and Jen did not watch basketball, which would not contradict either statement given.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that \"Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n",
