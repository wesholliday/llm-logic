(Premise 1)\n   - If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. (Premise 2)\n\n2. Premise 1 tells us that the pants are not necessarily denim; they could be some other material.\n3. Premise 2 is a conditional statement: if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim.\n\n4. We want to infer whether the shirt was not cotton given these premises.\n\n5. To do this, we can use the contrapositive of the conditional statement in Premise 2. The contrapositive says that if the pants are not denim, then the shirt is not cotton.\n\n6. Since we know from Premise 1 that the pants are not denim, we can conclude (using the contrapositive) that the shirt is not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
