It leaves open the possibility that the truck is made of plastic or any other material.\n\n2. \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" This is a conditional statement: if the doll is plastic, then the truck being metal is a necessary consequence. However, this does not mean that the truck has to be metal in all scenarios; it only applies when the condition (the doll being plastic) is met.\n\n3. We are asked to infer whether \"The doll was not plastic.\" To make this inference, we would need to know that the doll *is* plastic and then use the conditional statement to conclude that the truck must be metal. However, we only have information about what is not the case (the truck not being metal), but we do not have any information about whether the doll is plastic or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements alone, we cannot infer \"The doll was not plastic.\"\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n",
