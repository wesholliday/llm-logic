We are given two premises:\n   - It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\n   - If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\n\n2. The first premise tells us that it is not a necessary truth that Amy played tennis. In other words, Amy might or might not have played tennis.\n\n3. The second premise is an \"if-then\" statement where the \"then\" part (Amy must have played tennis) refers to the same proposition as in the first premise.\n\n4.

However, since the first premise only tells us that Amy might not have played tennis, and not necessarily that she did not play tennis, we cannot conclude that the second premise's \"if\" part is false.\n\n6. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer whether Jeff did or did not play basketball. The two premises are",
