We are given two premises:\n   - It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt (Premise 1).\n   - If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt (Premise 2).\n\n2. Premise 1 tells us that it is not a necessary truth that Mark bought the blue shirt; in other words, it is possible that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\n3. Premise 2 gives us a conditional statement: if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This means that if we assume Lisa bought the red shirt, it would logically follow that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\n4. However, since we know from Premise 1 that it is possible for Mark not to have bought the blue shirt, and Premise 2 tells us that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must buy the blue shirt, we can conclude that Lisa cannot have bought the red shirt, because that would contradict the possibility of Mark not buying the blue shirt.\n\n5. Therefore, from the given premises, we can infer 'Lisa",
