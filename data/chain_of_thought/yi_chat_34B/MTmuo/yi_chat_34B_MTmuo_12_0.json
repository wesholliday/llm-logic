We are given two premises:\n   - It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo (Premise 1).\n   - If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo (Premise 2).\n\n2. Premise 1 tells us that it is not a necessary truth that Lucy went to the zoo. In other words, Lucy's going to the zoo is not guaranteed or required.\n\n3. Premise 2 gives us a conditional statement: If Joe goes to the park, then Lucy must go to the zoo. This means that if we assume Joe went to the park (the antecedent of the conditional), we would be led to the conclusion that Lucy must have gone to the zoo (the consequent of the conditional).\n\n4. However, since Premise 1 tells us that it is not a necessary truth that Lucy went to the zoo, and Premise 2 gives us a condition under which Lucy would necessarily go to the zoo, we can infer from this that Joe did not go to the park. If he had gone to the park, then according to Prem",
