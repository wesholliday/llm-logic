It does not necessarily mean that they are not blueberry, just that their being blueberry is not a necessity or a given.\n\n2. \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\" This is an implication statement: if one thing is true (the cake is chocolate), then another thing must also be true (the muffins are blueberry). However, this does not tell us whether the cake is actually chocolate or not; it only establishes a conditional relationship between the two items.\n\nGiven these two statements alone, we cannot directly infer that \"The cake was not chocolate\" because the first statement does not guarantee that the muffins are not blueberry, and the second statement does not provide any information about whether the condition (the cake being chocolate) is true or false.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, we cannot logically conclude that \"The cake was not chocolate.\"\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n",
