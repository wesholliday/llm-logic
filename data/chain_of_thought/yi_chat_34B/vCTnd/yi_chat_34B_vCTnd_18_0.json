Let's break down the argument into its components:\n\nPremise: If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth.\nThis can be represented as an implication (if-then statement):\nD \u2192 \u00acDd\nWhere 'D' stands for 'the issue was discussed' and 'Dd' stands for 'the issue was discussed in depth'.\n\nConclusion: If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed.\nThis can be represented as another implication:\nDd \u2192 \u00acD\n\nNow, let's consider the structure of the argument. The premise says that if D is true (the issue was discussed), then \u00acDd must also be true (it was not discussed in depth). The conclusion states that if Dd is true (the issue was discussed in depth), then D must be false (it was not discussed).\n\nThe argument seems to be trying to establish a logical connection between 'being discussed' and '",
