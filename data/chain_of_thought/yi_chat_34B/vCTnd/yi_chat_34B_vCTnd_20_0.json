Let's break down the argument into its components:\n\nPremise: If a recommendation was made, then it was not a strong recommendation.\nSymbolically, this can be represented as:\nR \u2192 \u00acS\nWhere R stands for 'a recommendation was made' and S stands for 'it was a strong recommendation'.\n\nConclusion: If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made.\nSymbolically, this is represented as:\nS \u2192 \u00acR\n\nNow, let's think about the logical validity of the argument. A valid argument is one where the truth of the premise(s) guarantees the truth of the conclusion. In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nThe argument seems to be suggesting that because a strong recommendation (S) cannot coexist with a recommendation being made (R), if one is true, the other must be false. However, this does not necessarily follow from the premise alone. The premise only tells",
