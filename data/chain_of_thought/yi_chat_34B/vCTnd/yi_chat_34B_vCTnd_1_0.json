The argument states a conditional premise: \"If it's raining, then it's not raining hard.\" This can be represented as A \u2192 B, where 'A' stands for 'It's raining' and 'B' stands for 'It's not raining hard'.\n\n2. The conclusion of the argument is also a conditional statement: \"If it's raining hard, then it's not raining.\" This can be represented as C \u2192 D, where 'C' stands for 'It's raining hard' and 'D' stands for 'It's not raining'.\n\n3. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the premise (A \u2192 B) logically implies the conclusion (C \u2192 D). In other words, does knowing that if it rains, then it doesn't rain hard, allow us to conclude that if it rains hard, then it doesn't rain?\n\n4. Intuitively, we might think this is not a valid argument because the premise talks about 'not raining hard' when it rains, while the conclusion talks about 'not raining' when it rains hard. These seem like different",
