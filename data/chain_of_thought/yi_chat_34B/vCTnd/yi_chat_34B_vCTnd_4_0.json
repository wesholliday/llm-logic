This can be represented as an implication: If A (Ben studied), then B (he did not study diligently).\n\n2. The conclusion of the argument is that if Ben studied diligently, then he did not study. This can also be represented as an implication: If C (Ben studied diligently), then D (he did not study).\n\n3. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the premises imply the conclusion. In other words, does A (Ben studied) necessarily lead to C (Ben studied diligently)? And does B (he did not study diligently) necessarily lead to D (he did not study)?\n\n4. The premise tells us that if Ben studied, then he did not study diligently. This means that A (Ben studied) and B (he did not study diligently) are related by an implication. However, it does not specify whether C (Ben studied diligently) is a necessary consequence of A (Ben studied).\n\n5. The conclusion states that if Ben studied diligently, then he",
