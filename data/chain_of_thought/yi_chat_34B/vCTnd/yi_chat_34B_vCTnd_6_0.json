This means that there are two possibilities: either the clothes were not washed at all or they were washed but not properly.\n\n2. The conclusion of the argument is that if the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed. This seems to be a restatement of the premise, as it implies that if the clothes were washed and it was done properly, then they would have been both washed and not washed (which is logically contradictory).\n\n3. The form of the argument appears to be an attempt at a logical proof by contradiction. However, the conclusion does not follow from the premise because it introduces a logical contradiction. If the clothes were washed properly, then they would not be in the state of being both washed and not washed.\n\n4. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid because its conclusion does not follow from its premise; rather, it introduces an additional assumption that leads to a logical contradiction.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>",
