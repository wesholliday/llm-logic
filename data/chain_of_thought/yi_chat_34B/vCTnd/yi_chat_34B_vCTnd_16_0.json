The argument states a conditional premise: \"If the job was completed, then it was not completed well.\" This can be represented as A \u2192 B, where A is \"the job was completed\" and B is \"it was not completed well.\"\n\n2. The conclusion of the argument also presents a conditional statement: \"If the job was completed well, then it was not completed.\" This can be represented as C \u2192 D, where C is \"the job was completed well\" and D is \"it was not completed.\"\n\n3. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows from the premise. In other words, does A \u2192 B imply C \u2192 D?\n\n4. We can use the contrapositive rule to analyze this. The contrapositive of A \u2192 B is \u00acA \u2228 \u00acB, and the contrapositive of C \u2192 D is \u00acC \u2228 \u00acD.\n\n5. If we want to see if A \u2192 B implies C \u2192 D, we need to check if (\u00acA \u2228 \u00acB) implies (\u00acC \u2228 ",
