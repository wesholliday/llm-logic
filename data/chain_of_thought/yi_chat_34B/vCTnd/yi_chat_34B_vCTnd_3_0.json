This can be represented as an implication: \"Eating a meal \u2192 Not eating a large meal\".\n\n2. The conclusion states that if you ate a large meal, then you did not eat a meal. This can also be represented as an implication: \"Eating a large meal \u2192 Not eating a meal\".\n\n3. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the premise implies the conclusion. In other words, does \"Not eating a large meal\" follow from \"Eating a meal\"?\n\n4. The problem with this argument is that it is not logically valid because it commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent. This means that even if the premise is true (you did not eat a large meal), it does not necessarily mean that the conclusion must also be true (you did not eat a meal).\n\n5. The truth table for an implication shows that if the antecedent (the part before the arrow) is false, then the implication is true regardless of the truth value of the consequent (the part",
