The argument has a premise that states \"If Jane studied, then she did not study long.\" This can be represented as an if-then statement: If A (Jane studied), then B (she did not study long).\n\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"If Jane studied long, then she did not study.\" This can also be represented as an if-then statement: If C (Jane studied long), then D (she did not study).\n\n3. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the premises could possibly be true and the conclusion false at the same time. In other words, we are looking for a situation where A is true and B is false, but C is also true and D is false.\n\n4. The premise tells us that if Jane studied (A), then she did not study long (B). This means that if A is true, then B must be true as well. There is no way for A to be true and B to be false simultaneously.\n\n5. The conclusion states that if Jane studied long (C), then she did not study (D",
