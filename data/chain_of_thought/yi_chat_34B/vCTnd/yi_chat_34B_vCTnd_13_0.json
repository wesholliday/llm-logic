This can be represented as an implication: If A (Alex exercises), then B (he does not exercise much).\n\n2. The conclusion of the argument is that if Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise. This can also be represented as an implication: If C (Alex exercises much), then D (he did not exercise).\n\n3. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the premises imply the conclusion. In other words, does B (not exercising much) necessarily follow from A (exercising)? And does D (not exercising) necessarily follow from C (exercising much)?\n\n4. The premise says that if Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much. This means that whenever Alex exercises, we can conclude that he did not exercise much. However, the premise does not specify what happens when Alex does not exercise at all. It only tells us about the relationship between exercising and not exercising much.\n\n5. The conclusion tries to infer from the premise that if Alex exercised much, then he must have not exercised at all.",
