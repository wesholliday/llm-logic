To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure and see if it follows a logical pattern.\n3. The premise suggests that being served and being served promptly are mutually exclusive events.\n4. If we assume that the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true because it logically follows from the premise.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, the argument appears to be logically valid.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
