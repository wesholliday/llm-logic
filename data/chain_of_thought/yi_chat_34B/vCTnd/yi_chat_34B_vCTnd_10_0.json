Let's break down the argument into its components:\n\nPremise: If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice.\nConclusion: If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered.\n\nThe premise is essentially saying that if advice was given, it must have been unhelpful. The conclusion is saying that if helpful advice was given, then the advice must not have been offered (which seems contradictory at first).\n\nTo assess validity, we can use a truth table to analyze all possible combinations of the premises being true or false:\n\n1. If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice.\n2. Helpful advice was offered.\n3. Advice was not offered.\n\nNow let's consider each combination:\n\n- If 1 is true and 2 is true, then the conclusion (3) must also be true for the argument to be valid. However, this leads to a contradiction because we are saying both that helpful advice was offered (2) and that if it was",
