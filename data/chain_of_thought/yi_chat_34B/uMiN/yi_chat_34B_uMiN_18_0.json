The phrase \"might not\" suggests that there is a possibility that the notebook is not in the drawer, but it does not provide certainty. Since \"might not\" indicates a potential absence, we cannot definitively conclude that the notebook must be in the drawer. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that it's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n",
