To infer whether it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding, we need to consider the opposite scenario: if Mary *must* have been at the wedding, then there would be no possibility of her not being there.\n3. Since the statement suggests a possibility that she might not have been present, it follows that the condition where she must have been there cannot be true.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.<|im_end|>\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n",
