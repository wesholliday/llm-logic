The statement suggests that the jacket \"might\" not be draped over the chair. \"Might\" implies a possibility, but does not confirm with certainty that the jacket is not on the chair.\n2. To infer whether it's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair, we need to consider the opposite scenario: what if the jacket were definitely not on the chair? The use of \"might\" suggests that this is a possibility, but not a definitive statement.\n3. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot conclude with certainty that the jacket must be draped over the chair or that it must not be. We can only say that there is a possibility that it might not be.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n\n",
