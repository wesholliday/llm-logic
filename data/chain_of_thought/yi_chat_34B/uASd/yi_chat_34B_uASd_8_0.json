We are asked to infer whether if the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today.\n\nThe key here is to understand that 'misrouted' means the package has gone off its intended course. If the package has been misrouted, this suggests that there might be a delay in its arrival since it is not following the expected path.\n\nGiven the initial premise that if the package has shipped, it will arrive today, we can consider two possible scenarios:\n\n- The package ships without any issues and follows the correct route, so it arrives today as stated.\n- The package is misrouted, which implies a deviation from the expected path. In this case, there might be additional time needed to correct the route or investigate the issue, potentially delaying the arrival date.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the understanding that 'misrouted' could lead to a delay, we cannot infer with certainty that if the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today",
