If I fertilize the lawn under normal conditions (no drought), it will likely be lush and green because fertilizer provides nutrients that help grass grow healthy and strong.\n\n2. However, if there is a drought, regardless of whether the lawn has been fertilized, the lack of water can override the benefits of fertilizer. Drought conditions can lead to wilting, browning, and even death of the grass due to dehydration.\n\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that if I fertilize the lawn and there is a drought, it will be lush and green. The presence of fertilizer does not guarantee lushness in the face of extreme environmental conditions such as drought.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]",
