If I water the plants and there is no sunlight, they will grow.\n\nThe first statement suggests that watering the plants is a necessary condition for them to grow. In other words, without water, the plants won't grow. However, it does not specify what other conditions are required for growth, such as sunlight.\n\nThe second statement introduces the additional condition of no sunlight. Here, we need to consider whether sunlight is also a necessary condition for plant growth. If it is, then adding water without sunlight would not result in growth because the absence of sunlight negates another necessary condition.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that watering the plants without sunlight will result in growth. We need additional information about the role of sunlight in plant growth to make that determination.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]To answer this question, let's consider the two statements separately:\n\n1.
