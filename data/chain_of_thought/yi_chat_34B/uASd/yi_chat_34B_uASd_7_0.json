Therefore, when the oven is on, the kitchen is warm.\n\nNow, let's consider the additional information that the pilot light is out:\n\n4. A functioning pilot light is not necessary for the oven to generate heat (assuming it has an electric ignition or another method of lighting the burners).\n5. Since the oven can generate heat without the pilot light, its absence does not affect whether the oven is on and producing heat.\n6. If the oven is on and producing heat, regardless of the pilot light's status, the kitchen will be warm.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes",
