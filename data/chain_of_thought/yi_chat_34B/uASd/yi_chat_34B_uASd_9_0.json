The essay is well-written and turned in late.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if an essay meets certain criteria of being well-written, then the student who wrote it will receive an A grade. However, this does not necessarily mean that every aspect of the essay is perfect or that there are no other factors that could affect the grade. It simply suggests that a well-written essay is a necessary condition for getting an A.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the essay meets the criteria of being well-written and that it was turned in late. The lateness of the submission could potentially be a factor in the student's final grade, depending on the specific grading rubric or instructions provided by the instructor. If the instructor has stated that late submissions will not be penalized, then we cannot infer that the student will get an A based solely on the essay being well-written and turned in late.\n\nTherefore, without additional information about how lateness is handled in the grading process, we cannot definitively say that",
