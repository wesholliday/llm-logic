This is because during sleep, our body and brain rest and recover from the day's activities.\n\n2. However, doing hard labor can be physically and mentally demanding, and it can cause fatigue regardless of how much sleep you get. Hard labor can surpass the energizing effect of a good night's sleep.\n\n3. Therefore, while getting enough sleep is necessary to prevent tiredness under normal circumstances, it does not necessarily mean that you won't be tired if you engage in hard labor. The additional stress of hard labor can still lead to fatigue.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we cannot infer that if you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired.<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: no<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Explanation: While getting enough sleep is essential for maintaining energy levels and preventing fatigue under normal circumstances, it does not guarantee that you will not feel tired after engaging in hard labor.
