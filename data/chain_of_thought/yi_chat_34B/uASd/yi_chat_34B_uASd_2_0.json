A bomb going off at the concert is an additional factor that was not mentioned in the original statement.\n3. The question now asks if we can infer that even with this new information (the bomb), we would still have a good time.\n\nGiven these steps, it seems logical to conclude that the presence of a bomb going off at the concert would likely negate the initial expectation of having a good time. Therefore, based on the information provided and the reasonable assumption that a bomb detonation is an unpleasant event, we cannot infer that we would still have a good time under those circumstances.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>",
