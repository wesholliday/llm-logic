The statement \"Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer\" is a logical disjunction, meaning that one of two possibilities must be true.\n2. We are given that \"The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet\" which means that the first possibility is false.\n3. If the first possibility is false and we have to choose between the two possibilities, then the second one must be true by default, because we cannot have both being false (due to the nature of a disjunction).\n4. Therefore, since the keys are not dangling in the cabinet and they must be either dangling or in the drawer, it follows that they must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
