The statement \"Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter\" tells us that there are only two possibilities for where the milk could be: in the fridge or on the counter.\n2. The second statement, \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge,\" suggests that one of the possibilities is not true (i.e., the milk is not in the fridge).\n3. Since there are only two options given and one of them has been eliminated (the milk not being in the fridge), then by process of elimination, the milk must be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
