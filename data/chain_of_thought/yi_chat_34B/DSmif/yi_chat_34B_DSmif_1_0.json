It does not specify which is true at this point.\n\n2. \"Fido might not be in the garden.\" This suggests that one of the possibilities mentioned in the first statement (that Fido is in the garden) could be false.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can infer that if the second statement is true (Fido might not be in the garden), then the only remaining possibility is that Fido is inside, as per the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[STEP]To further clarify our reasoning, let's consider a Venn diagram with two circles representing \"Fido is in the garden\" and \"Fido is inside.\" The first statement says that Fido must be in one of these two locations. If we know that Fido might not be in the garden (the area where the circle for \"Fido is in the garden",
