The pen might not be on my desk.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the pen has to be either on the desk or in the bag. Statement 2 tells us that it might not be on the desk. Since both statements are true and exclusive (meaning they cover all possibilities), if the pen is not on the desk, then by necessity, it must be in my bag.\n\nTherefore, we can infer from these two statements that 'The pen is in my bag'.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
