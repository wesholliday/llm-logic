The second statement negates the possibility that the puzzle piece is on the floor. Since both statements cannot be false at the same time (due to the law of excluded middle, which states that a proposition is either true or false), if one is true, the other must be false.\n\nSince we know that the puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor, the first statement must be false, and therefore, the second part of the disjunction (the missing puzzle piece is in the box) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Explanation: The logical reasoning behind this inference is based on the law of excluded middle, which states that a proposition is",
