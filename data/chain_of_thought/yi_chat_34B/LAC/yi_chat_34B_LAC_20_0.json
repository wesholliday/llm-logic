In other words, the fact that the banana was yellow does not necessarily mean that the apple was red.\n\nStep 4: To infer that \"The apple was red\" from the given information, we would need additional evidence or a different logical structure. The statement \"If P, then Q\" does not allow us to conclude P if we know Q is true without further information.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information and the rules of logic, we cannot logically infer that \"The apple was red\" from the fact that \"The banana was yellow\" together with the conditional statement",
