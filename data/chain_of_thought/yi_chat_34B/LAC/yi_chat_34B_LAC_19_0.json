            "content": "\nStep by Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is a conditional statement that can be represented as A \u2192 B, where A = \"Tom watched football\" and B = \"Jen watched basketball\".\n2. We are given that B (Jen watched basketball) is true.\n3. According to the rules of logic for conditional statements, if the hypothesis (A in this case) is true, then the conclusion (B) must also be true. However, if the conclusion (B) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the hypothesis (A) is true; it could be false and the conclusion still hold true.\n4. Therefore, from the information given, we cannot logically infer that Tom watched football (A) just because Jen watched basketball (B). The truth of B does not guarantee the truth of A.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n\n",
