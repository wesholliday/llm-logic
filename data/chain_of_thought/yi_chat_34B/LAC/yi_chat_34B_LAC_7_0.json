It can be represented as A \u2192 C, where A stands for 'Alex finishes the race' and C stands for 'Chris finishes the race'.\n\n2. \"Chris finished the race.\" This is a factual statement that provides us with information about one of the possible outcomes of the conditional statement.\n\nNow, we are asked if we can logically infer from these two pieces of information that Alex also finished the race. To answer this question, let's consider the logical implications:\n\n- If Chris finished the race (which we know to be true), then according to the conditional statement (A \u2192 C), Alex must have finished the race as well for the condition to be met.\n\nHowever, there is a caveat here. The conditional statement does not guarantee that if Chris finished the race, Alex definitely did too; it only says that if Alex *did* finish the race, then so did Chris. This means that while we can infer from the given information that Alex might have",
