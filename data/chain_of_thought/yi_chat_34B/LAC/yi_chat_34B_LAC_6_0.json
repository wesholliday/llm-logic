The statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is a conditional statement that can be represented as A \u2192 B, where A is the event \"Sue chose pizza\" and B is the event \"Bob chose pasta\".\n\n2. We are given that Bob did choose pasta (B is true).\n\n3. According to the definition of a conditional statement, if the conclusion B is true, then the hypothesis A must be true for the conditional statement to be true.\n\n4. Therefore, since we know B is true (Bob chose pasta), we can conclude that A must also be true (Sue chose pizza) in order for the original conditional statement to be valid.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
