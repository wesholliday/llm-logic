We have a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This is represented as V \u2192 M, where V stands for vampire and M stands for mummy.\n\n2. We are also given that the mummy was awake (M).\n\n3. To logically infer whether the vampire was awake (V) from the information provided, we can use the transitive property of implication in logic. If A \u2192 B is true and B is true, then we can infer that A is true.\n\n4. However, the conditional statement V \u2192 M only tells us that if the vampire were awake, the mummy would be awake; it does not specify anything about the converse: whether the mummy being awake implies that the vampire is also awake.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot logically infer that the vampire was awake just because the mummy was awake. The statement \"The mummy was awake\" does not provide enough evidence to determine the status of the vampire's wakefulness.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by Step Reasoning:\n",
