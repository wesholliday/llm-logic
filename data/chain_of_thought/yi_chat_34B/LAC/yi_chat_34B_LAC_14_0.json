It can be represented as A \u2192 B, where A is 'the bear was in the cave' and B is 'the wolf was in the den'.\n\n2. \"The wolf was in the den.\" This is a factual statement that tells us B (the wolf being in the den) is true.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can logically infer A (the bear being in the cave) from these two statements. According to the rules of logic, if we have a conditional statement A \u2192 B and we know that B is true, then we can conclude that A must also be true. This is because if A were false, the entire conditional statement would be false, which contradicts our assumption that B (the consequent) is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the logic of conditionals, we can infer 'The bear was in the cave' from 'The wolf was in the den' and the given conditional statement 'If the bear was in the cave, then",
