We can represent this as P \u2192 Q.\n\n2. \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This is a factual statement that tells us Q is true.\n\nNow, we are asked if we can logically infer 'Lisa bought the red shirt' from these two statements. To do this, we would need to apply the rule of inference for conditional statements, which states that if P \u2192 Q and Q are true, then we can conclude P must also be true. However, there is a caveat: this rule only applies if the conditional statement is a logical necessity, meaning that it is true regardless of whether the antecedent (P) is true or false.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" does not necessarily mean that Lisa buying the red shirt is the only reason for Mark buying the",
