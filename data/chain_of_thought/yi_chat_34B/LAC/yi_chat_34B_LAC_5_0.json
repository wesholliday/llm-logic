The statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is a conditional statement that can be represented as A \u2192 B, where A = \"Jeff played basketball\" and B = \"Amy played tennis\".\n2. We are given the information that \"Amy played tennis\" (B).\n3. According to the rules of logic for conditional statements, if the conclusion (B) is true, then we cannot determine whether the hypothesis (A) is true or false. This is because there are two possibilities: either A is true and B follows from it, or A is false but B is true for some other reason not related to A.\n4. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot logically infer that \"Jeff played basketball\" (A) just because \"Amy played tennis\" (B).\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n\n",
