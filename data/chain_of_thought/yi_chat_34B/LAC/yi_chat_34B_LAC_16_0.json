If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. (Premise 1)\n2. The pants were denim. (Premise 2)\n\nWe are asked to determine if we can infer 'The shirt was cotton' from these premises. To do this, we need to apply the rules of logical inference. Specifically, we are looking at a conditional statement in Premise 1 ('If A then B') and an affirmation of the consequent (Premise 2 states B).\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, if we have 'If A then B' and 'B', we cannot directly infer 'A' without additional information or a second premise that would be an affirmation of the antecedent ('A'). The problem is known as the \"affirming the consequent fallacy\" in informal logic.\n\nIn this case, Premise 2 only tells us that B (the pants were denim) is true, but it does not provide any information about whether A (the shirt was cotton",
