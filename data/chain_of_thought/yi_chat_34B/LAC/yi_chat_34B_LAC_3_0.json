This means that if P is true, then Q must also be true.\n\nStep 3: Determine the validity of Premise 1.\nSince we are given both Premise 1 and Premise 2, we can assume that Premise 1 is valid (true) because it was assumed to be true in order for us to consider the second premise.\n\nStep 4: Apply the rules of inference.\nIf P \u2192 Q is true and Q is also true, then by the rules of logic, we can infer that P must be true. This is known as modus ponens.\n",
