            "content": "[THINK]To determine whether we can logically infer that Mary was at the wedding from the given information, let's break down the statements and analyze them step by step:\n\n1. The first statement is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"if P, then Q,\" where 'P' represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and 'Q' represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This directly confirms the 'Q' part of the conditional statement.\n\n3. To logically infer Mary's presence at the wedding, we would need to use the principle of modus ponens, which states that if a conditional statement is true and its consequent (the 'Q') is known to be true, then we can conclude that the antecedent (the 'P') must also be true.\n\n4. However, in this case, we are not given the truth of the entire original conditional statement; we only know that the 'Q' part is true. We do not have direct evidence for the truth of the 'P' part",
