It implies that there is at least some chance that the event of slogging did not occur.\n\nNow, 'It's not the case that the glip must have been slogged' means that it is not necessarily true that the glip was slogged. This statement aligns with the idea that there is a possibility that the glip was not slogged, as suggested by the first statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the reasoning above, we can infer 'It's not the case that the glip must have been slogged' from 'The glip might not have been slogged.'\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Explanation: The phrase \"might not\" implies a possibility of something not happening, while \"must have been\" suggests certainty.
