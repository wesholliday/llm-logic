It leaves open the option that it could be an original or unaltered version.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed\": This directly contradicts the idea that the splat had to be morphed. It asserts that there is no requirement for the splat to have been altered.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can see that they are logically consistent with each other. The possibility that \"The splat might not have been morphed\" aligns with the idea that \"It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed.\" Therefore, we can infer from the first statement to the second without any logical contradiction.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Yes<|im_end|>\n",
