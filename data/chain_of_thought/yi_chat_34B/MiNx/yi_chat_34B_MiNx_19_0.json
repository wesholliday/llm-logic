            "content": "[SYS]To determine whether we can infer 'It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled' from 'The smonk might not have been vreebled,' let's consider the implications of each statement.\n\n1. 'The smonk might not have been vreebled': This suggests that there is a possibility that the smonk was not vreebled. It implies that there is at least some chance that the event did not occur.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled': This statement directly contradicts the idea that the smonk had to be vreebled. It asserts that it is not a certainty or an inevitability that the smonk was vreebled.\n\nGiven these interpretations, we can see that 'The smonk might not have been vreebled' does indeed imply 'It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled.' The first statement suggests a possibility of non-vreebling, while the second statement denies any necessity or certainty of vreebling. Therefore, we can infer the latter from the former.\n\nAnswer",
