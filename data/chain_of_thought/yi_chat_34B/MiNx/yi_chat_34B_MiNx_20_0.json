'The fleeg might not have been bluttered': This suggests that there is a possibility that the fleeg was not bluttered. It implies that there is at least some chance that the event did not occur.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered': This statement asserts that it is not necessary or certain that the fleeg was bluttered. It suggests that the absence of the fleeg being bluttered is a possibility.\n\nGiven these interpretations, we can see that there is a logical connection between the two statements.
