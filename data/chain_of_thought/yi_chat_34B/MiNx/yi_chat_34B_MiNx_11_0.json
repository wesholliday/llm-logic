'The flug might not have been blummed': This suggests that there is a possibility that the flug was not blummed. It implies that there is an element of uncertainty regarding whether the flug was indeed blummed or not.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed': This statement directly negates the idea that the flug had to be blummed. It asserts that it is not a necessary conclusion that the flug was blummed.\n\nGiven these interpretations, we can see that there is a logical connection between the two statements.
