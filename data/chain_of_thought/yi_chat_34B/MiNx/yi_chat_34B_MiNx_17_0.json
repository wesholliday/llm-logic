It suggests that the absence of being skizzled is a potential outcome, but it does not rule out the possibility that the flob could have been skizzled.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled\" directly states that the flob does not necessarily have to be skizzled. It implies that there is no requirement for the flob to be skizzled, and it leaves open the possibility that it might not have been skizzled.\n\nGiven these interpretations, we can see that both statements are expressing similar ideas: they both suggest that the flob may or may not have been skizzled, leaving the outcome uncertain. Therefore, based on this reasoning, we can infer 'It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled",
