            "content": "[SYS]To determine whether we can infer 'It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled' from 'The fribble might not have been snurgled,' let's consider the implications of each statement.\n\n1. 'The fribble might not have been snurgled': This suggests that there is a possibility that the fribble was not snurgled. It implies that there is at least some chance that the event did not occur.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled': This statement asserts that it is not necessary or required that the fribble was snurgled. It suggests that the absence of the fribble being snurgled is a possibility, but does not necessarily mean that it definitely did not happen.\n\nGiven these interpretations, we can see that 'The fribble might not have been snurgled' aligns with the idea that 'It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled.' The first statement implies a potential lack of occurrence, while the second states that it is not mandatory or certain that the event occurred.\n\nAnswer",
