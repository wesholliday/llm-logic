We are given two statements:\n   - If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry (conditional statement in the form of an if-then statement).\n   - The muffins were blueberry (consequent of the conditional statement).\n\n2. According to the rules of logic for a conditional statement, if the consequent is true, we cannot conclude anything about the truth of the antecedent (in this case, whether the cake was chocolate) without additional information.\n\n3. The second statement tells us that the muffins were blueberry, which means the consequent of the conditional statement is true.\n\n4. However, because the first statement is an if-then statement, we cannot logically conclude that the antecedent (the cake was chocolate) is also true based solely on the truth of the consequent without further information.\n\n5. Therefore, with the information provided, we cannot logically conclude that the cake was chocolate.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
