The first statement is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where 'P' represents \"Joe went to the park\" and 'Q' represents \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" This provides us with information about one part of the conditional statement (the 'Q' part) being true.\n\n3. To logically conclude that \"Joe went to the park\" (P) from the given information, we would need to use the rule of inference known as modus ponens, which states that if you have a conditional statement 'If P then Q' and you know that Q is true, you can infer that P must also be true.\n\n4. However, in this case, we only know that 'Q' (Lucy went to the zoo) is true, but we do not have confirmation that 'P' (Joe went to the park) is true. The second statement does not provide any information about Joe's whereabouts",
