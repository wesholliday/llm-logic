We have a conditional statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This is an implication, where 'griffin in the forest' is the antecedent (P) and 'unicorn in the forest' is the consequent (Q).\n\n2. We also have a statement of fact: \"The unicorn was in the forest.\" This is the consequent Q from the conditional statement.\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if the consequent is true, and we have an implication where the antecedent (P) does not logically imply the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ), then we can conclude that P must be true. This is because the conditional statement 'if P, then Q' is only false when P is true and Q is false (exclusive disjunction).\n\n4. Since we have 'The unicorn was in the forest' (which is Q) and it does not logically imply that 'The griffin was not in the forest' (which is \u00acP), we can conclude that 'The",
