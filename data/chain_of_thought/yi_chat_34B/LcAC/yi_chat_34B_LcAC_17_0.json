The first statement is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where 'P' represents \"Ben ate pasta\" and 'Q' represents \"Kate ate salad.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Kate ate salad.\" This provides us with evidence that the 'Q' part of the conditional statement is true (that Kate did indeed eat salad).\n\n3. To logically conclude 'Ben ate pasta' from these statements, we would need to use the rule of inference known as modus ponens, which states that if a conditional statement is true and its consequent (the 'Q' part) is true, then we can infer the truth of its antecedent (the 'P' part).\n\n4. However, in this case, we only know that the 'Q' part is true (Kate ate salad), but we do not have any information about whether the 'P' part (Ben ate pasta",
