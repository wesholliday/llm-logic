We have a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This is represented as A \u2192 B, where A is \"the vampire was awake\" and B is \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\n2. We also know that the mummy was awake (B).\n\n3. To logically conclude that the vampire was awake (A) from the given information, we would need to use the transitive property of implication in logic, which states that if A \u2192 B and B \u2192 C are true, then A \u2192 C is also true.\n\n4. However, in this case, we only have one side of the conditional statement fulfilled: B (the mummy was awake). We do not have information about whether A (the vampire was awake) is true or false.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the given information and the logical rules of inference, we cannot conclude that the vampire was awake just because the mummy was awake.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by Step Reasoning:\n\n1.
