The first statement is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"if P, then Q,\" where 'P' represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and 'Q' represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This directly confirms the 'Q' part of the conditional statement.\n\n3. To logically conclude 'Mary was at the wedding' from these statements, we would need to use the rule of inference known as modus ponens, which states that if you have a conditional statement \"if P then Q\" and you know that Q is true, you can infer that P must also be true.\n\n4. However, in this case, we are not given the 'P' part (Mary was at the wedding) as an additional premise; we are only given the 'Q' part (Sue was at the wedding) and asked if we can conclude",
