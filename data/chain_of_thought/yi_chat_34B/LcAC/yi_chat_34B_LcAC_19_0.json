The first statement is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"if P, then Q,\" where 'P' represents \"Tom watched football\" and 'Q' represents \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Jen watched basketball.\" This is an assertion that 'Q' (Jen watching basketball) is true.\n\n3. We are asked to determine if we can conclude 'P' (Tom watched football) from the truth of 'Q' and the conditional statement.\n\nIn a conditional statement, if the condition ('P') is true, then the conclusion ('Q') must also be true. However, the converse is not necessarily true; that is, knowing that 'Q' is true does not automatically mean that 'P' is true. This is because there could be other reasons for 'Q' to be true that do not involve 'P.'\n\nIn this case, we know that 'Jen watched basketball' (Q) is",
