If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. (Premise 1)\n2. The pants were denim. (Premise 2)\n\nWe are asked to determine if we can conclude that the shirt was cotton based on these premises. To do this, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nPremise 1 is an \"if-then\" statement, which in classical logic is interpreted as a material conditional. This means that if the condition (the shirt being cotton) is true, then the consequence (the pants being denim) must also be true. However, the converse of this implication is not necessarily true; just because the pants are denim does not mean that the shirt is cotton.\n\nPremise 2 tells us that the pants were indeed denim. This fact, by itself, does not provide any information about whether the shirt was cotton or not. It only confirms one part of the condition in Premise 1.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot logically conclude that the",
