It suggests that the possibility of the whiffle being shanked does not exist or is not certain.\n\n2. 'The whiffle might not have been shanked', on the other hand, indicates that there is a potential for the whiffle not to have been shanked. It implies that while it may not be known whether the whiffle was shanked or not, there is at least a chance that it wasn't.\n\nGiven these definitions, we can see that the first statement directly contradicts any notion of certainty regarding the whiffle being shanked. However, it does not necessarily imply that the whiffle might not have been shanked; it only asserts that the possibility of the whiffle being shanked is not a necessity.\n\nTherefore,",
