It suggests that the possibility of the flob being skizzled is open, but it does not necessarily mean it happened.\n\n2. 'The flob might not have been skizzled' is a statement that indicates there is a chance or possibility that the flob was not skizzled.\n\nGiven these definitions, we can see that the first statement directly implies the second. If there is no necessity for the flob to have been skizzled, then by definition, it might not have been skizzled. Therefore, we can infer 'The flob might not have been skizzled' from 'It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled.'\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Explanation: The statement \"It",
