In other words, it suggests that the splat could have been either morphed or not morphed, leaving both possibilities open.\n\n2. The phrase \"might not have been\" indicates a potential lack of an event occurring, suggesting a possibility rather than a certainty.\n\nGiven these considerations, we can infer that since 'It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed' leaves open the possibility that the splat was not morphed, then 'The splat might not have been morphed' is a valid inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Explanation: The original statement \"It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed\" implies that there is no",
