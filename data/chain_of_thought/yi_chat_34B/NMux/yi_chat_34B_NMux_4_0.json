            "content": "[SYS]To determine whether we can infer 'The fribble might not have been snurgled' from 'It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled', let's break down the statements:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled\" is a negative statement that implies there is no necessity for the fribble to have been snurgled. It suggests that the possibility of the fribble being snurgled is open, but it is not certain or required.\n\n2. 'The fribble might not have been snurgled' is also a statement about possibility, indicating that there is a chance the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nGiven these definitions, we can see that the first statement directly supports the second. If it is not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled, then by definition, the fribble might not have been snurgled. Therefore, we can infer 'The fribble might not have been snurgled' from 'It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled.'\n\nAnswer",
