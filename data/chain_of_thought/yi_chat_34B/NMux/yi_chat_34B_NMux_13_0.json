In other words, it suggests that the possibility of the glip being slogged is not a certainty.\n\n2. The phrase 'might not have been' indicates a potential absence of an event or action without specifying whether it definitely did not occur. It leaves open the possibility that something could have happened but does not require it to have happened.\n\nGiven these considerations, we can infer from 'It's not the case that the glip must have been slogged' that 'The glip might not have been slogged' because the first statement implies a lack of certainty about the glip being slogged, which is consistent with the idea that it might not have happened.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that the glip",
