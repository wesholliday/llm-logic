The original statement is an implication of the form \"If A, then B.\" Where A = instructions were given and B = they were not explained clearly.\n\n2. We are asked to infer a new implication in the opposite direction: \"If B, then A.\" This would mean that if the instructions were explained clearly (B), then it must be true that the instructions were not given (A).\n\n3. To determine if this is a valid inference, we need to consider whether the original statement logically implies its reverse. In other words, does \"If A, then B\" necessarily mean \"If B, then A\"?\n\n4. However, upon closer examination, we realize that the two statements are not equivalent. The first statement (A -> B) suggests that if instructions were given, they were not explained clearly. It does not address what happens when instructions are explained clearly.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the information provided by the original statement, we",
