The original statement is an implication of the form \"If A, then B.\" In this case, 'A' represents 'directions were provided' and 'B' represents 'they were not explained clearly.'\n\n2. We are asked to infer a new implication with the same logical structure but reversed order of the conditions: \"If B, then A.\"\n\n3. According to the original statement, if directions were provided (A), then they were not explained clearly (B). This means that whenever 'A' happens, 'B' also happens.\n\n4. However, the reverse does not necessarily hold true. Just because something is not explained clearly (B) does not mean that directions were provided (A). It is possible for directions to be unclear without having been provided at all.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If directions were explained clearly (B), then directions were not provided (A)\" from the original statement. The two conditions",
