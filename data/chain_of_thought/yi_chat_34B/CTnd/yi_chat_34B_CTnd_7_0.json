The original statement is in the form of a conditional sentence: If A, then B. This means that if event A (the customer being served) occurs, then event B (not being served promptly) must also occur.\n\n2. We are asked to infer a new conditional sentence: If B, then not A. This would mean that if event B (not being served promptly) occurs, then event A (the customer being served) cannot occur.\n\n3. However, the original statement does not provide information about what happens when event B (not being served promptly) occurs; it only tells us that if the customer is served (event A), they are not served promptly (event B also occurs). It does not tell us whether prompt service (not-B) would imply that the customer was not served (not-A).\n\n4. Therefore, based on the information provided in the original statement, we cannot logically infer 'If the customer was",
