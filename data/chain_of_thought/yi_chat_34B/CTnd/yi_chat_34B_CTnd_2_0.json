The original statement is in the form of a conditional sentence: \"If A, then B\" where A represents 'Ann exercised' and B represents 'she did not exercise strenuously'.\n\n2. The inference we are trying to make is also a conditional sentence: \"If C, then D\" where C represents 'Ann exercised strenuously' and D represents 'she did not exercise'.\n\n3. To infer the second statement from the first, we need to consider whether the conditions of the original statement logically imply the conditions of the inferred statement.\n\n4. The problem with this inference is that it assumes that there are only two options: either Ann exercised strenuously (C) or she did not exercise at all (D). However, the original statement does not preclude the possibility that Ann exercised but not strenuously, which would be a third option (B).\n\n5. Therefore, based on the information provided by '",
