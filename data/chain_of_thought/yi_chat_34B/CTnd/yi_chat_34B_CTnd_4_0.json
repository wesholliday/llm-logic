If Ben studies (A), then he does not study diligently (B). This is given as true.\n2. We want to know if when Ben studies diligently (C), then he does not study (D).\n\nIntuitively, it seems like the inference might be correct because if Ben did not study diligently when he studied (A -> B), then surely when he does study diligently (C), he must have not been studying at all (D).
