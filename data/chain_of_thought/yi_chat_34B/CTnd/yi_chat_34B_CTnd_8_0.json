The original statement is \"If the issue was addressed, then it was not addressed effectively\". This is a conditional statement where 'the issue was addressed' is the antecedent (A) and 'it was not addressed effectively' is the consequent (B). In logical notation, this can be written as A \u2192 B.\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer \"If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed\". This would also be a conditional statement with 'the issue was addressed effectively' as the antecedent (C) and 'it was not addressed' as the consequent (D). In logical notation, this would be C \u2192 D.\n\n3. To infer C \u2192 D from A \u2192 B, we need to find a relationship between C and A, and between D and B. However, there is no direct information provided about the relationship between addressing the issue effectively (C) and addressing it in general (",
