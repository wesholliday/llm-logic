The original statement is in the form of a conditional (if-then) statement: If A, then B. Where A = 'the job was completed' and B = 'it was not completed well'.\n\n2. We are asked to infer a new conditional statement: If C, then D. Where C = 'the job was completed well' and D = 'it was not completed'.\n\n3. To make this inference, we would need to find a logical connection between A (job completed) and C (job completed well), and between B (not completed well) and D (not completed).\n\n4. However, there is no direct logical connection between 'completed well' and 'was not completed' in the original statement. The original statement only tells us that if the job was completed, it was not done so well. It does not provide any information about what happens when the job is completed well.\n\n5. Therefore,",
