In other words, if the advice was not helpful (Q), then advice must have been offered (P). This is logically equivalent to saying that if helpful advice were offered (not-Q), then advice would not have been offered (not-P).\n\nHowever, the original statement does not provide any information about what would happen if helpful advice were offered. It only tells us that if advice was offered, it was not helpful. Therefore, we cannot infer the converse from the original statement with certainty. The original statement does not imply \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered\" (not",
