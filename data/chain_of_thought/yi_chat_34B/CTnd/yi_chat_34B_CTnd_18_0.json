            "content": "[SYS]To determine whether we can infer 'If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed' from the statement 'If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth', let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. The original statement says that if the issue was discussed, it was not discussed in depth. This means that any discussion of the issue did not go into great detail.\n\n2. We are asked to infer whether, if the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed. In other words, we are being asked if discussing the issue in depth precludes it from having been discussed at all.\n\n3. Logically, if an issue is discussed but not in depth, that means there has been some discussion of the issue, just not a detailed one. It does not necessarily mean that the issue was not discussed at all.\n\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer from the original statement that if the issue was discussed in depth, it was not discussed. In fact, the two statements are not directly related; one talks about the depth of discussion and the other simply states that there has been some discussion without specifying its depth.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>",
