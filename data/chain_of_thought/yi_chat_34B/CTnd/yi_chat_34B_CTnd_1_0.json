The original statement is in the form of a conditional (if-then) statement: If A, then B. Where A = 'It's raining' and B = 'It's not raining hard'.\n\n2. We want to infer a new conditional statement: If C, then D. Where C = 'It's raining hard' and D = 'It's not raining'.\n\n3. To infer the new statement from the original, we need to consider the logical relationship between A and C (the antecedents) and B and D (the consequents).\n\n4. The original statement tells us that if it's raining (A), then it's not raining hard (B). This means that when A is true, B must also be true.\n\n5. However, the relationship between C (it's raining hard) and D (it's not raining) is not",
