You could have eaten both a large meal and another smaller meal, just not simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided by the original statement, we cannot logically infer that \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal.\" The two events (eating a meal and eating a large meal) are independent in terms of their occurrence, but they are mutually exclusive in terms of their timing.\n\nAnswer: no<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]",
