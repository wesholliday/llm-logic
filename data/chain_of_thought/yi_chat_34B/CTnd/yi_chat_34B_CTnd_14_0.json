The antecedent (the part before 'then'): \"If the meal was prepared\"\n2. The consequent (the part after 'then'): \"it was not prepared carefully\"\n\nNow, let's consider the proposed inference:\n1. The antecedent of the inferred statement is the same as the consequent of the original statement: \"The meal was prepared carefully\"\n2. The consequent of the inferred statement is the negation of the antecedent of the original statement: \"It was not prepared\"\n\nTo make this inference, we would essentially be flipping both parts of the original if-then statement around and inverting their meanings. However, this does not logically follow from the original statement. The original statement tells us that if a meal is prepared, it is not done so carefully, but it does not tell us anything about what happens when the",
