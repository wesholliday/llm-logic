The first statement is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"if P, then Q,\" where 'P' represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and 'Q' represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This directly confirms that one part of the conditional statement (the 'Q' part) is true.\n\n3. To conclude that Mary was at the wedding based on these statements, we would need to use the logical principle of modus ponens, which states that if \"if P, then Q\" is true and \"P\" is true, then \"Q\" must also be true.\n\n4. However, in this case, we only know that \"Q\" (Sue was at the wedding) is true; we do not have information about whether \"P\" (Mary was at the wedding) is true.\n\n5. Therefore, based solely on",
