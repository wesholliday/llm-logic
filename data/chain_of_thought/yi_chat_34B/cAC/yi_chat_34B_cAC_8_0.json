It means that if A is true, then B must also be true.\n\n2. \"The mummy was awake.\" This is a factual statement that tells us B (the mummy being awake) is true.\n\nNow, we can use the conditional statement to infer the truth of A under certain conditions:\n\n- If B is true and A \u2192 B, then by the definition of a conditional statement, A must also be true. This is because if you assume the hypothesis (A in this case) to be true, and it leads to a true conclusion (B), then the hypothesis itself must be true.\n\nHowever, there's an important caveat: The conditional statement does not guarantee that A is true if B is true without additional information. In other words, just because the mummy was awake doesn't necessarily",
