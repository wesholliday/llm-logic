We can represent this as A \u2192 C, where A stands for 'Alex finishes the race' and C stands for 'Chris finishes the race'.\n\n2. \"Chris finished the race.\" This is a factual statement that tells us that the conclusion of the conditional statement (C) is true.\n\nNow, we know from the rules of logic that if the consequent of a conditional statement is true, then the hypothesis (antecedent) may or may not be true. In other words, just because we know C is true does not necessarily mean A is also true. The best we can say is that it's possible for A to be true, but it's not guaranteed.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot conclude with certainty that Alex finished the race. We can only",
