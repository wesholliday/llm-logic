We can represent this as A \u2192 B.\n\n2. \"The robot visited Jupiter.\" This is a factual statement that confirms one part of the conditional statement (B) is true.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer the truth of the antecedent (A) from the consequent (B) being true. In a standard conditional statement, if B is true, then A must also be true for the conditional to hold. However, in this case, we have a separate piece of information that tells us B is true without any explicit information about A.\n\nBased on the information provided, we cannot definitively conclude that 'the alien visited Mars' (A) just because 'the robot visited Jupiter' (B). The conditional statement \"If A, then B\" does not",
