If the conditional statement were always true (if P is true, then Q must also be true), then knowing that Q is true would allow us to infer that P is true.\n\nHowever, the truth value of a conditional statement's conclusion (Q) does not necessarily imply the truth of its antecedent (P). This is because the relationship between P and Q could be probabilistic or there might be other factors at play that we are not considering. For example, even if",
