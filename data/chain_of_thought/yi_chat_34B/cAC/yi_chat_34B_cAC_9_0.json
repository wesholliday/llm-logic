The first statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement where 'Lisa buying the red shirt' is the hypothesis (or antecedent) and 'Mark buying the blue shirt' is the conclusion (or consequent).\n\n2. The second statement is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This is an assertion that Mark fulfilled the condition of buying the blue shirt.\n\n3. We are asked to determine if, given that Mark bought the blue shirt, we can conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nTo make this conclusion, we would need to know that the first statement is a true and valid conditional statement, meaning that if the hypothesis (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the conclusion (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true. However, we are not given any information about Lisa's purchase of the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot conclude with certainty that Lisa bought the red shirt just because",
