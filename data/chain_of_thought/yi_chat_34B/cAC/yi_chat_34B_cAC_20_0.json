However, the original conditional statement does not guarantee that P must be true for Q to be true. It only states that if P is true, then Q will also be true.\n\nSince we do not have any information about the apple's color other than what is implied by the conditional statement, we cannot definitively conclude that the apple was red just because the banana was yellow. The apple's color could be red, but it could also be another color without contradicting the given information.\n\nTherefore, based",
