The first statement is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"if P, then Q,\" where 'P' represents \"Joe went to the park\" and 'Q' represents \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" This is an assertion that 'Q' (Lucy going to the zoo) is true.\n\n3. We are asked to determine if we can conclude 'P' (Joe going to the park) from 'Q' being true and the conditional statement.\n\nIn a conditional statement, if the second part ('Q') is true, then the first part ('P') must also be true for the conditional to be true. However, in this case, we only know that 'Q' (Lucy went to the zoo) is true; we do not have any information about the truth of 'P' (Joe going to the park). Therefore, based on the",
