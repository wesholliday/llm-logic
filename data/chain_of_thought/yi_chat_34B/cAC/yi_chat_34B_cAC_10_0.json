According to the rules of logic for conditional statements:\n\n- If both A and B are true, then the conditional statement A \u2192 B is true (because the condition implies the result).\n- However, if B is true but A is false, then the conditional statement A \u2192 B can still be true (this is known as the \"vacuous truth\").\n\nIn this case, we know that B (the cat being outside) is true, but we do not have information about the truth value of A (the dog being inside). Therefore, based solely on the information",
