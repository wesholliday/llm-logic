It still exists and has not been exhausted.\n\n2. \"Either the dreb is vroombed or it is spended.\" This is a logical statement that tells us that one of two outcomes must be true: either the dreb is vroombed (whatever that means), or it is spended (which we already know is not the case).\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that since the dreb is not spended (as per statement 1) and it must be either vroombed or spended (according to statement 2), then the only remaining option is that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
