In this case, either the smip is shripped (option A), or it is lupped (option B).\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that if the smip is not lupped (as per statement 1), then it must be shripped, because the disjunctive statement (statement 2) tells us that only one of the options can be true at a time. Since we know that option B (lupped) is not true, then by process of elimination, option A (shripped) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
