Since both statements are true and we cannot have a situation where the clug is neither fleeked nor snugged (because of the \"either/or\" in statement 2), we must conclude that:\n\n3. If it's not snugged, then it must be fleeked, according to statement 2.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
