Since we already know that the whiffle is not tinked (according to statement 1), and we have a logical disjunction in statement 2 (meaning one of two options must be true), we can deduce that if the first option (the whiffle is shanked) is not true, then the second option (it is tinked) must be true by default.\n\nHowever, we are given information that contradicts this: The whiffle is not tinked. Since both options in statement 2 cannot be false simultaneously (due to the nature of a disjunction)",
