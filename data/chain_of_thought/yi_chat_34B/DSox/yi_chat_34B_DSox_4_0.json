Since there are only two options given (snurgled or crinked) and one of them has been eliminated (crinked), it logically follows that the fribble must be in the remaining state, which is:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\nThe fribble is snurgled.<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Explanation: Since we know that the fribble cannot be crinked (based on statement 1) and there are only two options given (snurgled or crinked), we can conclude that the fribble must be snurgled, as this is the only remaining option.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n",
