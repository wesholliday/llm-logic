We are given two pieces of information:\n   - \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" (conditional statement)\n   - \"Jen watched basketball\" (consequent of the conditional statement)\n\n2. The second piece of information confirms that the consequent of the conditional statement is true.\n\n3. According to the rules of a conditional statement, if the consequent is true, then the antecedent (the part before 'then') must also be true for the entire statement to be true.\n\n4. Therefore, since we know that \"Jen watched basketball\" is true and it follows from the conditional statement, it implies that \"Tom watched football\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
