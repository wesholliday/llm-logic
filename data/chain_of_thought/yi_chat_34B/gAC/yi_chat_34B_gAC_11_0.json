We are given two pieces of information:\n   - \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" (conditional statement)\n   - \"The muffins were blueberry\" (consequent of the conditional statement)\n\n2. The second piece of information confirms that the consequent is true.\n\n3. According to the rules of a conditional statement, if the consequent is true, then the antecedent (the part before 'then') must also be true for the entire statement to be true.\n\n4. Therefore, since we know the muffins were blueberry and that this confirms the truth of the second part of the original statement, it follows that the cake was indeed chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
