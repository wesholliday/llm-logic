We are given two pieces of information:\n   - \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" (conditional statement)\n   - \"Lucy went to the zoo\" (consequent of the conditional statement)\n\n2. The first piece of information is a conditional statement, which can be represented as an if-then proposition: If A, then B.\n\n3. The second piece of information tells us that B (Lucy going to the zoo) is true.\n\n4. According to the rules of logic for conditional statements, if the consequent (B) is true, and the antecedent (A) is not false, then the entire conditional statement (If A, then B) is true.\n\n5. We are not given any information about whether Joe went to the park (A) or not. Therefore, we cannot determine the truth value of A based on the information provided.\n\n6. Since we do not know the truth value of A (Joe going to the park), we cannot definitively conclude that \"Joe went to the park\" is true just because \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is true",
