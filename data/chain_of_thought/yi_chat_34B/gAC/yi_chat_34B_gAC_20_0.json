We are given two pieces of information:\n   - \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" (Premise 1)\n   - \"The banana was yellow\" (Premise 2)\n\n2. Premise 1 is a conditional statement that can be represented as 'A \u2192 B' where 'A' is 'The apple was red' and 'B' is 'The banana was yellow'.\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if both premises are true, we can infer the truth of the conclusion using the following logical steps:\n   - If Premise 1 (the conditional statement) is true, then when Premise 2 (the consequent) is true, it confirms that the antecedent (Premise 1) must also be true.\n   - In other words, because we know 'The banana was yellow' (B) is true and 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' (A \u2192 B) is true, we can conclude that 'The apple was red' (A) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
