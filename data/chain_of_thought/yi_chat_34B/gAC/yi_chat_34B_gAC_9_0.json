            "content": "\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two pieces of information:\n   - \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" (conditional statement in the form of an if-then statement)\n   - \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" (consequent of the conditional statement)\n\n2. The second piece of information confirms that the consequent of the conditional statement is true.\n\n3. Since the consequent is true, we can now apply the truth table for a conditional statement to determine the truth value of the antecedent (\"Lisa bought the red shirt\").\n\n4. According to the truth table for conditionals, if the consequent is true, then the entire conditional statement is true. This means that both the antecedent and the consequent are true.\n\n5. Therefore, because the conditional statement is true, it follows that \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
