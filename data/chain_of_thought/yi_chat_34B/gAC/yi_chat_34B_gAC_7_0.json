We are given two pieces of information:\n   - \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" (conditional statement A \u2192 B)\n   - \"Chris finished the race\" (assertion of B)\n\n2. According to the rules of logic for conditional statements, when the conclusion B is true, the entire conditional statement (A \u2192 B) is considered true if and only if the antecedent A is also true.\n\n3. Since we know that Chris finished the race (B is true), we can use this information to determine whether Alex finished the race (A) must be true as well.\n\n4. However, the statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" does not guarantee that Alex's finishing the race is a necessary condition for Chris to finish the race. It could be that other conditions also lead to Chris finishing the race.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively conclude that \"Alex finished the race\" is true just because \"Chris finished the race\" is true. There might be other scenarios where Alex does not finish the race but Chris still does.\n\n",
