We are given two statements:\n   - If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal (conditional statement).\n   - The truck was metal (consequent of the conditional statement).\n\n2. According to the rules of logic, if the consequent is true and the antecedent is not stated as false, then the antecedent must be true. This is because a conditional statement is considered true unless we are told otherwise.\n\n3. In this case, since the truck being metal (the consequent) is true, and there is no information provided to suggest that the doll was not plastic (the antecedent), we can conclude that the doll must have been plastic for the conditional statement to be true.\n\n4. Therefore, if 'The truck was metal' is true, it follows logically that 'The doll was plastic' must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
