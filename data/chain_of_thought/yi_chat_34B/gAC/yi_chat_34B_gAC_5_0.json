We are given two pieces of information:\n   - \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" (conditional statement)\n   - \"Amy played tennis\" (consequent of the conditional statement)\n\n2. The first piece of information is a conditional statement, which can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\n3. The second piece of information tells us that Q (Amy played tennis) is true.\n\n4. According to the rules of logic, if a conditional statement's consequent (Q) is true, then the entire conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) is true only if the antecedent (P) is also true.\n\n5. Therefore, we need to determine whether the antecedent (\"Jeff played basketball\") is true based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is a conditional statement that can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis",
