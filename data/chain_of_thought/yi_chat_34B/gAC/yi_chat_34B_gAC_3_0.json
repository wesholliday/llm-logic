We are given two pieces of information:\n   - If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel (Premise 1).\n   - The book is a mystery novel (Premise 2).\n\n2. Premise 2 tells us that the book is a mystery novel.\n3. Premise 1 states that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel.\n4. Since we know from Premise 2 that the book is a mystery novel, and Premise 1 says that being a mystery novel is a consequence of being written by James, we can conclude that:\n   - The book being a mystery novel fulfills the condition given in Premise 1.\n\n5. Therefore, it logically follows that 'The book was written by James' must be true, because if it were not true (i.e., if someone else wrote the book), then we would not have the consequence of it being a mystery novel as stated in Premise 1.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\nExplanation: The transitive property of logic states that if A implies B and",
