            "content": "\nStep by Step Reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   - \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" (True)\n   - \"The pants were denim\" (True)\n\n2. The first statement is an implication, which can be represented as a conditional statement: If A (shirt is cotton), then B (pants are denim).\n\n3. According to the truth table for conditionals, if both the antecedent (A) and the consequent (B) are true, then the entire conditional statement is true.\n\n4. Since we know that \"The pants were denim\" is true (B is true), and the implication as a whole is true, it follows that the antecedent (A: shirt is cotton) must also be true for the implication to hold.\n\n5. Therefore, based on our reasoning, 'The shirt was cotton' must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
