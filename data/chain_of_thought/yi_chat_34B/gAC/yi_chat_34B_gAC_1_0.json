We are given two pieces of information:\n   - If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (conditional statement in the form of an if-then statement).\n   - Sue was at the wedding (a factual statement).\n\n2. The second piece of information tells us that Sue was indeed at the wedding.\n\n3. Since we know that Sue was at the wedding, we can apply the first piece of information to conclude that Mary must have been at the wedding as well, because the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is necessary for the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) to be true.\n\n4. Therefore, it follows logically that 'Mary was at the wedding' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
