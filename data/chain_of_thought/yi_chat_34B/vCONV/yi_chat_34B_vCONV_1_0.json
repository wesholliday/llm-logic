The argument states a premise that establishes a conditional relationship between Mary's attendance at the wedding and Sue's attendance at the wedding.\n2. The premise can be represented as an if-then statement: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n3. The conclusion reverses the order of the if-then statement from the premise, asserting that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\n4. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the reversal of the conditionals in the premise and the conclusion maintains the same logical relationship.\n5. In a valid argument, if the premise is true (the conditional statement holds), then the conclusion must also be true.\n6. However, reversing the order of a conditional does not necessarily maintain the truth value; it depends on whether the original conditional was an instance of the transitive property of implication or not.\n7. The transitive property of implication states that if A implies B and B implies C, then A implies C. This is not the case in all instances of conditionals.\n8. Therefore, without additional information about the relationship between Mary",
