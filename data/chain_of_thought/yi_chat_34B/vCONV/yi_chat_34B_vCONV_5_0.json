The conclusion (C) is that if Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball.\n3. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the premises could be true and the conclusion false at the same time.\n4. If the premise is true (Jeff did play basketball), then according to the premise, Amy must have played tennis.\n5. If Amy did play tennis (which follows from the premise being true), then the conclusion is also true (because it states that if Amy played tennis, Jeff played basketball).\n6. There is no scenario in which the premise is true and the conclusion false, because if the premise is true, the conclusion must be true as well.\n7. Therefore, there is no logical contradiction between the premises being true and the conclusion being false.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
