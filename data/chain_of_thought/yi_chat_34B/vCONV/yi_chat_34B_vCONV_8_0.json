The conclusion suggests that if the mummy was awake, it would imply that the vampire was awake as well.\n3. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the premises could ever be true without making the conclusion false.\n4. If the premise is true (vampire awake => mummy awake), then the conclusion must also be true (mummy awake => vampire awake) for the argument to be valid.\n5. However, the premise and the conclusion are not logically equivalent; they do not have the same truth values in all possible scenarios.\n6. Therefore, it is possible for the premise to be true without the conclusion being true, which means the argument is not logically valid.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: no<|im_end|>\n\n[END]<|im_end|>\n\n[START]\n",
