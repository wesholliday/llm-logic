The argument states a conditional premise: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be represented as A \u2192 B, where A is 'the apple was red' and B is 'the banana was yellow'.\n\n2. The conclusion of the argument also states a conditional: \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\" This can be represented as B \u2192 A.\n\n3. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the premise (A \u2192 B) implies the conclusion (B \u2192 A). In other words, does knowing that if A happens, B must also happen, mean that if B happens, A must have happened first?\n\n4. The logical validity of an argument depends on whether the truth of its premises guarantees the truth of its conclusion. In this case, the premise (A \u2192 B) only tells us that if A is true, then B must be true; it does not necessarily mean that if B is true, A must also be true.\n\n5. The fallacy here is known as \"affirming the consequent\" or \"converse error.\" Just because we",
