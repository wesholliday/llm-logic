The conclusion (C) is that if Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza.\n3. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the premises could be true and the conclusion false at the same time.\n4. If P is true (Sue chose pizza), then C must also be true (Bob chose pasta) according to the premise.\n5. However, there's no information given about what happens when P is false (Sue did not choose pizza).\n6. Since we don't know the relationship between Bob's choice and Sue's choice when Sue does not choose pizza, we cannot determine if C must be true in all cases where P is false.\n7. Therefore, without additional information about what happens when Sue does not choose pizza, we cannot conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n\n",
