The argument states a conditional premise: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This can be represented as A \u2192 B, where A is 'the car was red' and B is 'the truck was blue'.\n\n2. The conclusion of the argument also states a conditional: \"If the truck was blue, then the car was red.\" This can be represented as C \u2192 D, where C is 'the truck was blue' and D is 'the car was red'.\n\n3. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the premise (A \u2192 B) implies the conclusion (C \u2192 D). In other words, does knowing that A \u2192 B necessarily mean that C \u2192 D must also be true?\n\n4. Intuitively, it seems that the direction of the conditionals in the premise and the conclusion are reversed. The premise suggests that if the car is red, then the truck is blue; but the conclusion says that if the truck is blue, then the car is red. These do not seem to be equivalent statements.\n\n5. To make the argument logically valid, we would need to ensure that given",
