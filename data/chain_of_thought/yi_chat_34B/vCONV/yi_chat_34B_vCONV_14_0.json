            "content": "\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. The argument states a premise that can be represented as an if-then statement: \"If the bear was in the case, then the wolf was in the den.\"\n2. The conclusion also presents an if-then statement: \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case.\"\n3. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the premises could be true and the conclusion false at the same time.\n4. If the premise is true (i.e., if the bear was indeed in the case), then according to the premise, the wolf must also be in the den.\n5. If the wolf is in the den as a result of the first statement being true, then the second statement (the conclusion) would also be true.\n6. Therefore, it is not possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false at the same time.\n7. Since there is no logical contradiction between the premise being true and the conclusion being true, the argument form is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
