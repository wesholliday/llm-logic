The argument can be represented symbolically as follows:\n\nPremise: If griffin was in the forest, then unicorn was in the forest (G \u2192 U)\nConclusion: If unicorn was in the forest, then griffin was in the forest (U \u2192 G)\n\nThe argument is attempting to reverse the direction of the conditional statement from the premise. However, the reversal of a conditional statement is not logically valid without additional information or assumptions. In other words, knowing that if G then U does not necessarily mean that if U then G.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premise and conclusion alone, this form of argument is not logically valid.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: no<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No, the argument is not logically valid based on the provided premise and conclusion.
