The conclusion states that if the book is a mystery novel, then it must have been written by James.

To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows from the premise. In other words, does \"If B, then A\" follow logically from \"If A, then B\"?\n\n4. One way to think about this is to consider the truth values of 'A' and 'B'.
