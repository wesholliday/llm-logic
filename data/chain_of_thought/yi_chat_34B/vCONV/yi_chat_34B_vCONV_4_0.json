The argument states a conditional premise: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\" This can be represented as A \u2192 B, where A is 'the alien visited Mars' and B is 'the robot visited Jupiter'.\n\n2. The conclusion of the argument also presents a conditional statement: \"If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien visited Mars.\" This can be represented as B \u2192 A.\n\n3. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the premise (A \u2192 B) implies the conclusion (B \u2192 A). In other words, does knowing that if A happens, B must also happen, mean that if B happens, A must have happened first?\n\n4. According to the law of contraposition in logic, if A \u2192 B is true, then so is \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA. This means that if it's not the case that B has occurred (the robot visited Jupiter), then it must be the case that A has not occurred (the alien did not visit Mars).\n\n5. However, the argument as stated does not follow this pattern. It claims that if B occurs (",
