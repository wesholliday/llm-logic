The argument states a conditional premise: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be represented as A \u2192 B, where A is 'Joe went to the park' and B is 'Lucy went to the zoo'.\n\n2. The conclusion of the argument also states a conditional: \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park.\" This can be represented as C \u2192 D, where C is 'Lucy went to the zoo' and D is 'Joe went to the park'.\n\n3. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise. In other words, does A \u2192 B imply that C \u2192 D?\n\n4. According to the rules of logic, a conditional statement (A \u2192 B) is true unless both A and not-B are true. This means that if A is false or B is true, then A \u2192 B is true.\n\n5. The argument's validity depends on whether we can infer D from C given that A \u2192 B is true. However, the truth of A \u2192 B does not necessarily mean that we",
