            "content": "\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. The argument states a conditional premise: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as A \u2192 B, where A is 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and B is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n\n2. The conclusion of the argument also presents a conditional statement: \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\" This can be represented as C \u2192 D, where C is 'Mark bought the blue shirt' and D is 'Lisa bought the red shirt'.\n\n3. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise. In other words, does A \u2192 B imply that B \u2192 A?\n\n4. According to the law of contraposition in logic, a conditional statement A \u2192 B is logically equivalent to its contrapositive, which is \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA. This means that if we can show that C \u2192 D is logically equivalent to the contrapositive of A \u2192 B, then the argument would be valid.\n\n5. However, the conclusion C \u2192 D does not directly correspond to the contrapositive of A",
