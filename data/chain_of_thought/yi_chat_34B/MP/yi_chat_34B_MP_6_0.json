In other words, if Sue did choose pizza (P is true), then Bob must have chosen pasta (Q is true).\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the rules of logic, we can infer that Bob chose pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response. Thank you for your question. If you have any further questions or need assistance with a different topic, feel free to ask!<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n",
