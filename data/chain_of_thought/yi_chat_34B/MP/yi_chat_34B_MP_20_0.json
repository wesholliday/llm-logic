The first statement is \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"if P, then Q,\" where 'P' represents \"the apple was red\" and 'Q' represents \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"The apple was red.\" This provides us with a piece of evidence that directly relates to the condition ('P') in the first statement.\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if the condition ('P') in a conditional statement is true, then the conclusion ('Q') must also be true.\n\nTherefore, since we know 'P' (the apple was red) is true, we can infer that 'Q' (the banana was yellow) is also true.<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n\n[RESP]Answer: yes<|im_end|><|im_end|>\n[EXPLAIN]Based on the explanation provided above, when we have a conditional statement of the form \"if P, then Q\"",
