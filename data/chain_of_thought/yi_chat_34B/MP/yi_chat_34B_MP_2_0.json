In symbols, P \u2192 Q.\n\n2. \"The griffin was in the forest.\" This provides evidence that the antecedent of the conditional statement is true.\n\nNow, we can use the properties of logical implication to make an inference:\n\n- If P \u2192 Q and P are true, then Q must also be true (by the rules of material implication).\n\nSince we have established that P (the griffin being in the forest) is true, we can conclude that Q (the unicorn being in the forest) must also be true. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the unicorn was in the forest.<|im_end|>\n[END]",
