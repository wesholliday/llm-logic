Therefore, since we know P is true (the cake was chocolate), Q must also be true (the muffins were blueberry).\n\nStep 4: Based on this reasoning, we can infer that \"The muffins were blueberry\" given the information provided by both statements.<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]",
