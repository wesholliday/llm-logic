The statement can be represented as P \u2192 Q.\n\n2. \"The shirt was cotton.\" This provides us with information that the antecedent (P) is true.\n\nNow, in a valid argument from a conditional statement, if the antecedent (P) is true and the conditional statement is true (P \u2192 Q), then the consequent (Q) must also be true. This is known as the rule of inference for modus ponens.\n\nTherefore, since we have established that P is true and P \u2192 Q is true, we can infer that Q is true.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[THINK]To determine if we can infer that the pants were denim given the information provided, let's break down the statements and",
