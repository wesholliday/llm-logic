The first statement is \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This is an example of a conditional statement in logic, where 'if A, then B' (A \u2192 B) means that if A is true, then B must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The book was written by James.\" This provides us with the information that the first part of the conditional statement (A) is true.\n\n3. Since we know that A is true (James wrote the book) and 'if A, then B' is also given, we can conclude logically that B must be true as well.\n\n4. Therefore, from the information provided, we can infer that \"The book is a mystery novel\" because if James wrote it, and it is known that if James writes a book, it is a mystery novel, then it follows that the book in question is indeed a mystery novel.<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n\n#",
