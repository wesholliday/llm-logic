The first statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"if P, then Q,\" where P represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Lisa bought the red shirt.\" This directly corresponds to the condition P in the first statement.\n\n3. According to the rules of logic for conditional statements, if the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true for the conditional statement to be true.\n\nGiven that Lisa bought the red shirt (P is true), we can conclude that Mark bought the blue shirt (Q is true) because the first statement guarantees this outcome. Therefore, we can infer 'Mark bought the blue shirt' from the given information.<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: yes<|im_end|><|im_end|>\n[EXPLAIN]Based on",
