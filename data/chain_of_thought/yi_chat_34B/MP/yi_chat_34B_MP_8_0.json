In symbols, P \u2192 Q.\n\n2. \"The vampire was awake.\" This provides us with evidence that the antecedent of the conditional statement is true.\n\nNow, according to the rules of logic for a conditional statement, if the antecedent (P) is true and the conditional itself is true (which it must be if it's a valid rule or has been previously established as true), then the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, since we know 'the vampire was awake' (P is true) and 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' (P \u2192 Q is true), we can infer that 'the mummy was awake' (Q is true).<|im_end|>\n",
