We are given two statements:\n   - If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (conditional statement in the form of an if-then statement).\n   - Mary was at the wedding (a factual statement).\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional that tells us what would happen if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) were true.\n\n3. The second statement confirms that the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is indeed true.\n\n4. Therefore, according to the rules of logic, when the condition of a conditional statement is met, we can conclude that the result or consequence of the conditional must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
