Since it is given that Alex did finish the race, we can conclude that the condition is met.\n\nGiven that the condition (Alex finishing the race) is true, according to the conditional statement, Chris finishing the race (Q) must also be true. Therefore, from the information provided, we can infer that Chris finished the race.<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: yes<|im_end|><|im_end|>\n[EXPLAIN]Based on our step-by-step reasoning above, where we established that if Alex finished the race (P), then Chris finishing the race (Q)",
