The original statement says that if you get enough sleep, you won't be tired. This suggests a direct cause-and-effect relationship between getting sufficient rest and feeling awake/not tired.\n\n2. The proposed inference adds an additional condition: doing hard labor. We need to consider whether this extra factor changes the outcome of the original statement.\n\n3. There is no logical reason to assume that adding hard labor to the equation would negate the effect of getting enough sleep. In other words, being physically active or exerting oneself after adequate rest does not necessarily mean that you will become tired again.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that if you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you still won't be tired.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Yes<|im_end|>\n",
