If the pilot light is out, it suggests that there might be an issue with the oven's ability to maintain a flame or function properly.\n\nHowever, without further information about how the pilot light affects the operation of the oven, we cannot definitively say that if the oven is on and the pilot light is out, the kitchen will still be warm. The pilot light could be a necessary condition for the oven to heat the kitchen effectively. If it's out, the oven might not work as intended, and thus the kitchen might not become warm.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that \"If the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is",
