The original statement establishes a conditional relationship between two events: the car being in the garage and its safety.\n2. The condition (the car being in the garage) is necessary for the outcome (safety) to occur.\n3. However, the statement does not specify what other conditions might affect the outcome.\n\nNow let's consider the proposed extension: \"If the car is in the garage and the garage is flooding, then it is safe.\"\n\n4. The new statement adds an additional condition (the garage flooding) to the original conditional statement.\n5. Logically, if we assume that the presence of water (flooding) does not change the safety status of the car, then the extension might hold true.\n6. However, in reality, flooding is likely to compromise the safety of the car, as it could lead to electrical issues, rust, or even cause the car to float away if the water level is high enough.\n\nBased on this analysis, we cannot infer that \"If the car is in the garage and the garage is flooding, then",
