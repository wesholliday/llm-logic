This suggests that a well-written essay is sufficient for getting an A. However, it does not specify whether any other conditions (such as turning in the essay on time) are also necessary for getting an A.\n\nThe proposed inference adds an additional condition: being well-written and turned in late. Since we do not have information about how the deadline affects the grading, we cannot definitively say that a student who turns in a well-written essay late will get an A. The original statement does not provide enough information to make this inference.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP",
