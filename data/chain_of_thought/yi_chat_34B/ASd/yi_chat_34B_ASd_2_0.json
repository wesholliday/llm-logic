The presence of this new condition does not necessarily negate the outcome predicted by the original statement, but it certainly complicates it.\n\nThe original statement suggests that under normal circumstances, attending the concert would lead to a good time. However, the introduction of an explosion changes the context significantly. It is reasonable to assume that in such an event, one's experience at the concert might be negatively affected, potentially leading to an outcome that is different from what was originally inferred (having a good time).\n\nIn conclusion, while the original statement suggests that going to the concert would lead to a good time, the modified statement with the additional condition of a bomb going off introduces too much uncertainty and potential for",
