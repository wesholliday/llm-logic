However, the proposed inference \"If I fertilize the lawn and there is a drought, it will be lush and green\" introduces an additional condition (a drought) which could potentially negate the effect of fertilization. A drought might lead to water stress for the grass, regardless of whether it has been fertilized, and thus the lawn might not be lush and green under those conditions. Therefore, we cannot infer that the lawn will definitely be lush and green if both fertilization and a drought occur simultaneously.<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\nAnswer: no<|im_end|>\nExplanation: The original statement \"If I fertilize the lawn, it will be lush and green\" implies that fertilization alone can make the lawn lush and green.
