The original statement implies that if you put in the effort to study, you will be able to pass the test under normal conditions.\n\nNow, let's break down the proposed inference:\n\n1. 'If I study hard and the test is in Chinese, I will pass the test': This statement suggests that regardless of the language the test is in, as long as you study hard, you will pass.\n\n2. The original statement does not specify the language of the test; it only states that if you study hard, you will pass. It does not guarantee success under all possible conditions, such as having the test in a different language than your native one.\n\n3. There is an additional condition added to the proposed inference ('the test is in Chinese') that was not present in the original statement. This new condition could potentially change the outcome, as it introduces an external factor (language proficiency) that the original statement does not account for.\n\nGiven these considerations, we cannot logically",
