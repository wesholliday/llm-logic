In other words, if you want to lose weight, you must exercise. However, it does not specify what other factors might be involved or whether there are any additional conditions required.\n\nWhen we add the clause 'and eat junk food' to the original statement, we are introducing an additional factor that could potentially negate the effect of exercise on losing weight. Junk food is typically high in calories and low in nutritional value, which means it might not contribute positively to weight loss efforts. In fact, consuming too much junk food while exercising could lead to weight gain instead of weight loss.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided by the original statement alone, we cannot logically infer that 'If I exercise and eat junk food, I will lose weight.' The two actions (exercising and eating junk food) do not necessarily have a synergistic effect on weight loss; in",
