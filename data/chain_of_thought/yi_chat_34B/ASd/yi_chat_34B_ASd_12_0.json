The original statement establishes a condition (finishing homework) that must be met for a consequence (playing video games) to occur.\n2. The proposed inference adds an additional condition (the computer catching on fire) to the original condition (finishing homework).\n3. There is no logical connection between finishing homework and the computer catching on fire in the original statement. Therefore, adding this new condition does not necessarily follow from the original statement's logic.\n4. The proposed inference implies that as long as both conditions (finishing homework and the computer catching on fire) are met, the consequence (playing video games) will occur. However, there is no information provided to suggest that these two events are related or that meeting one condition (homework done) guarantees that the other condition (computer on fire) will also be met.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we cannot infer 'If I finish my homework and my computer catches on fire, I",
