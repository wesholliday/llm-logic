This is because a conditional statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive. Therefore, based on the truth of the original statement, we can infer that \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake\" is indeed true.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
