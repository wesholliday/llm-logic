If A (the book was written by James), then B (the book is not a mystery novel).\n\nWe are asked to infer a new if-then proposition:\n2. If C (the book is a mystery novel), then D (the book was not written by James).\n\nTo make this inference, we need to establish a relationship between A and C, and between B and D. The contrapositive of the original statement is a logically equivalent form that might help us:\n3. If B (the book is not a mystery novel), then A' (the book was not written by James).\n\nHere, A' means \"not A\" because if the book is not a mystery novel, it implies that it could be any other type of novel, including",
