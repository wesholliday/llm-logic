The original statement is in the form of an if-then proposition: If A (Mary being at the wedding), then B (Sue not being at the wedding).\n2. We are asked to infer a new if-then proposition: If B' (Sue being at the wedding), then A' (Mary not being at the wedding).\n3. To infer this new proposition, we would need to reverse the original statement and negate both parts of the if-then relationship.\n4. Reversing the original statement would give us: If B, then A.\n5. However, when we reverse an if-then statement, we do not automatically negate the conditions; we only negate the entire statement itself.\n6. Therefore, reversing the original statement does not give us what we need to infer the new proposition.\n7. To further explore this, let's consider the contrapositive",
