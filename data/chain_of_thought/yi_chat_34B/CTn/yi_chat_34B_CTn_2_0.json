In classical logic, two conditionals are logically equivalent (have the same truth table) if and only if their antecedents (the parts before the \u21d2) are true whenever their consequents (the parts after the \u21d2) are false, and vice versa.\n\nHowever, the reverse implication does not necessarily hold in this case because the original statement is a conditional, not a biconditional (which would imply that if one animal is present, the other must be absent).
