If the doll was plastic, then the truck was not metal.\n\nThe proposed inference is:\n2. If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic.\n\nTo make this inference, we would need to reverse the direction of the original conditional statement while maintaining its truth value. In other words, we are looking for a logically equivalent inverse.\n\nHowever, in logic, when you have a conditional statement 'If A, then B' (A \u2192 B), its inverse is not necessarily 'If B, then A' (B \u2192 A). The inverse of 'If A, then B' would be 'If not B, then not A' (\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA). This is because the logical connectives do not distribute in this way.\n\nTherefore, based on the original statement, we cannot directly infer 'If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic' without additional information",
