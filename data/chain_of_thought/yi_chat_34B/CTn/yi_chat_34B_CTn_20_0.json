If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow.\n\nThe proposed inference is:\n2. If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red.\n\nLet's analyze these two statements logically:\n\n- Statement 1 can be represented as 'red apple \u2192 not yellow banana'.\n- Statement 2 would be represented as 'yellow banana \u2192 not red apple'.\n\nNow, let's consider the contrapositive of each statement:\n\n- The contrapositive of statement 1 is 'not red apple \u2192 yellow banana'.\n- The contrapositive of statement 2 would be 'red apple \u2192 not yellow banana'.\n\nNotice that the contrapositive of statement 1 is equivalent to the original statement 2, which means that if we know statement 1 is true, then statement 2 must also be true (and vice versa) because they are logically equivalent through their contraposit",
