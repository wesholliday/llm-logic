In other words, it reverses the condition and changes 'not' to 'is' and vice versa.\n\nNow, according to the law of contraposition in logic, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive will also be true. This is because a conditional statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive.\n\nSince we are given that \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin did not take a train\" is true, we can infer that its contrapositive, \"If Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane,\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
