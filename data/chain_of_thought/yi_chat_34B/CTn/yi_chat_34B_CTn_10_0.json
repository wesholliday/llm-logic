One such equivalence is the contrapositive rule, which states that for any two statements P and Q, the following are logically equivalent:\n\n1. If P then Q (P \u2192 Q)\n2. If not Q then not P (Q' \u2192 P')\n\nApplying this to our original statement A \u2192 B, we get:\n\n3. If A' then B' (A' \u2192 B')\n\nHowever, the inference we are asked to make is B' \u2192 A', which is not directly equivalent to any of the forms we have",
