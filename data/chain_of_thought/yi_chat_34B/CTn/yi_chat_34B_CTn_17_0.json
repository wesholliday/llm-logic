If the original statement is true, then its contrapositive will also be true.\n\nNow, let's consider the validity of the contrapositive:\n\n1. If the original statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate did not eat the salad\" is true, then we can conclude that whenever Ben eats pasta, Kate does not eat the salad.\n2. The contrapositive says \"If Kate ate the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\" This means that if Kate's eating the salad is true (the condition), then Ben not eating pasta must also be true (the result).\n3. Since the original statement implies that whenever P (Ben eats pasta) is true",
