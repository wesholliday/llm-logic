In classical logic, an implication (if-then statement) is considered true unless the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. However, in this case, we are looking at two separate implications with different antecedents and consequences.\n\nThe first implication (S \u2192 \u00acP) tells us that if Sue chooses pizza, then Bob does not choose pasta. The second implication (P \u2192 \u00acS) would tell us that if Bob chooses pasta, then Sue does not choose pizza. While these implications share some common elements, they are not directly related in a",
