The contrapositive flips both parts of the implication and negates one of them. In this case, the contrapositive of \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo\" would be \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\nSince the original statement A \u2192 B is true (by assumption), its contrapositive B \u2192 \u00acA must also be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"If Lucy went to",
