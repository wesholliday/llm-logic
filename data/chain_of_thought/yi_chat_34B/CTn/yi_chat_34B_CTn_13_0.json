If the car was red, then the truck was not blue.\n\nThe proposed inference is:\n2. If the truck was blue, then the car was not red.\n\nLet's analyze these two statements logically:\n\n- Statement 1 can be represented as 'Red car \u2192 Not blue truck'. This means that if we know the car is red, it implies that the truck cannot be blue.\n\n- To infer statement 2 from statement 1, we would need to find a logical connection between the color of the truck and the color of the car. However, statement 1 only provides information about the relationship between the colors of the car and the truck when the car is red; it does not specify what happens if the car is not red or if the truck is blue under other circumstances.\n\n- Therefore, based on the information provided by 'If the car was red, then the truck was not blue',",
