            "content": "[SYS]To determine whether we can infer 'If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football' from the statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen did not watch basketball', let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is in the form of an if-then proposition: If Tom watched football, then Jen did not watch basketball. This means that whenever the condition 'Tom watched football' is true, the consequence 'Jen did not watch basketball' must also be true.\n\n2. We are asked to infer the reverse implication: If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football. In other words, we are looking for a situation where if the consequence 'Jen did not watch basketball' is false (because she actually watched basketball), the condition 'Tom watched football' must also be false.\n\n3. However, there is no direct logical connection between the original statement and the proposed inference. The original statement only tells us that when Tom watches football, Jen does not watch basketball; it does not provide any information about what happens when Jen *does* watch basketball or when Tom does not watch football.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the information given in the original",
