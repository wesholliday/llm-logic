This would be represented as B \u2192 A.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, you cannot directly infer a conditional statement B \u2192 A from another conditional statement A \u2192 B without additional information. The best you can do is to say that if both A and B are true (the bear is in the cave and the wolf is not in the den), then we can conclude that B \u2192 A is true. However, without knowing the truth values of A and B independently, we cannot definitively say that B \u2192 A is true or false based solely on the information provided by A \u2192 B.\n\nIn other words, from the given statement \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den,\" we cannot infer",
