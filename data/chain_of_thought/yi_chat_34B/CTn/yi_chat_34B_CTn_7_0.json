The original statement is in the form of an if-then proposition: If A (Alex) finished the race, then B (Chris) did not finish the race.\n2. To infer the reverse, we would need to know that the relationship between finishing and not finishing is symmetric. In other words, if A's finishing implies B's not finishing, we would need to also know that B's finishing implies A's not finishing.\n3. However, there is no information provided to suggest that this symmetry exists. The statement only tells us about the relationship in one direction (Alex to Chris), not the other way around (Chris to Alex).\n4. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer with certainty that if Chris finished the race, then Alex did not finish the race. There might be scenarios where both Alex and Chris could have finished or not finished the race simultaneously, without any direct logical consequence between their individual outcomes",
