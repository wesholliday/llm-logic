In a conditional statement, if the antecedent (the part before the arrow) is true, then the consequent (the part after the arrow) must be true as well. However, the reverse does not necessarily hold true in all cases.\n\nIn this case, knowing that A \u2192 B does not automatically mean that B \u2192 A is also true. The two events (the alien visiting Mars and the robot visiting Jupiter) are separate and independent; one does not necessarily cause or prevent the other from occurring. Therefore, we cannot infer a direct reversal of the",
