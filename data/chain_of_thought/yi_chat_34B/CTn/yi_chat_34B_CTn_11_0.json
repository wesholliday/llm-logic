To determine if we can infer \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate,\" we need to look at the logical structure of the original statement and reverse the conditions while maintaining the same relationship between them.\n3. The original statement has a conditional structure: If A (cake is chocolate), then B (muffins are not blueberry).\n4. To infer the new statement, we would need to reverse this to: If B (muffins are blueberry), then A (cake is not chocolate).\n5. The reversal maintains the same logical relationship between the conditions: if one condition is true, the other must be false.\n6. Therefore, based on the original statement, we can infer that \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\"\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
