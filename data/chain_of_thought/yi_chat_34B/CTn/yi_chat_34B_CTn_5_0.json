In a conditional statement, if the antecedent (the part before the arrow) is true, then the consequent (the part after the arrow) must also be true. However, if the antecedent is false, it does not necessarily mean that the consequent is true; it could be true, false, or unknown.\n\nIn this case, we have no information about whether Amy played tennis or not, and we only know that if Jeff did play basketball, then Amy would not play tennis. We cannot directly infer from this that if Amy did play tennis, Jeff must not have played basketball,",
