            "content": "\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\" is a conditional statement of the form A -> B, where A represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and B represents \"the pants must have been denim\".\n\n2. We are given that it is not the case that the pants must have been denim (B is false). This means that the truth value of B in the conditional statement A -> B is false.\n\n3. According to the logical law of contraposition, if A -> B is true and B is false, then we can infer that A is also false. In other words, if the pants must not have been denim (B is false), then we can conclude that the shirt was not cotton (A is false).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the law of contraposition, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n",
