            "content": "[SYS]Let's break down the information given step by step:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This is a conditional statement that tells us something about the relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. It does not specify which action actually occurred.\n\n2. It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This means that despite what the first statement suggests, we know for certain that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can now make an inference:\n\n3. Since we know that Mark did not buy the blue shirt (which is a necessary consequence of the second statement), and we also know that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark would have to buy the blue shirt (from the first statement), we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Yes<|im_end|>\n",
