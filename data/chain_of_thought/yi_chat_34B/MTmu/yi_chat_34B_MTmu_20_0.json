To infer this, we would need to show that if A \u2192 B is true and not-B is true, then not-A must also be true. This is because if the condition (A) never leads to the consequence (B), then the condition (A) cannot have been met in the first place.\n\nHowever, the second statement only tells us that it's not the case that B is true; it does not provide any information about whether A could be true or false. It is possible that A is true and",
