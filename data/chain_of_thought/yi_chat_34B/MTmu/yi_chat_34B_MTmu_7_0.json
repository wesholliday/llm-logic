The statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q.\" In this context, P represents \"Alex finished the race\" and Q represents \"Chris must have finished the race.\"\n\n2. We are given that it is not the case that \"Chris must have finished the race.\" This means that the condition Q (\"Chris must have finished the race\") is false.\n\n3. In a conditional statement, if the conclusion (Q in this case) is false, then the entire conditional statement is false only when the premise (P) is true. If the premise is false, the truth value of the conditional statement cannot be determined based on the truth value of Q alone.\n\n4. Since we know that Q (\"Chris must have finished the race\") is false and the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is false only when P is true and Q is false, we can conclude that either both P and Q are false or just Q is false.\n\n5. We are given that Q (\"Chris must have finished the race\") is false. Therefore",
