            "content": "[RESP]Let's break down the information given step by step:\n\n1. \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement where 'Tom watching football' is the antecedent (P) and 'Jen watching basketball' is the consequent (Q). In logical notation, this can be written as P \u2192 Q.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\" This means that the statement 'Jen watched basketball' is false. In other words, we can conclude that \u00acQ (not Q) is true.\n\nNow, let's use the contrapositive rule which states that if a conditional statement is true, its contrapositive (P \u2192 Q is equivalent to \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP) is also true. Since we know that \u00acQ is true, by the contrapositive rule, we can conclude that \u00acP must be true as well.\n\n3. \"Tom did not watch football.\" This is what we get from the contrapositive of the original conditional statement: since \u00acQ (Jen didn't watch basketball) is true, and P \u2192 Q is true",
