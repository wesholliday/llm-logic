It's not the case that the truck must have been metal. (\u00acM)\n\nWe are asked to infer whether 'The doll was not plastic' (\u00acP) from these two statements.\n\nAccording to classical logic, an implication (if-then statement) is false only when the antecedent (if part) is true and the consequent (then part) is false. In other words, P \u2192 M is false only if P is true and \u00acM is true.\n\nGiven that we have \u00acM (the truck was not metal), this means that the implication P \u2192 M cannot be evaluated as a whole without knowing whether P (the doll was plastic) is true or false.\n\nSince we are told that \u00acM (the truck was not metal), and we know that P \u2192 M is only false when P is true and \u00acM is true, we can conclude that P must be false for the implication to be true given \u00acM.\n\nTherefore, based on the information",
