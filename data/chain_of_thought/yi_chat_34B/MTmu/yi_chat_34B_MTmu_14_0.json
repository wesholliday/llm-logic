The first statement is \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\" It does not provide any information about what happens when the condition (A) is not met.\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den.\" This means that the assumption that the wolf was in the den is false. In other words, we can infer that the wolf was not in the den.\n\n3. However, the first statement does not specify what happens when the bear is not in the cave (the negation of A). It only tells us about the relationship between the bear being in the cave and the wolf being in the den. Since we know the wolf was not in the den, we cannot conclude anything about the bear's location in the cave based on the information provided by the first statement alone.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer '",
