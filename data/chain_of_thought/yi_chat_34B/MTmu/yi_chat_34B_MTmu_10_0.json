It's expressed as A \u2192 B, where A is 'dog inside' and B is 'cat outside'.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the cat must have been outside.\" This statement tells us that the second part of the conditional (B) is not true. In other words, it denies the necessity of B given A.\n\nNow, to infer whether the dog was not inside based on these two statements, we need to consider the implications:\n\n- If the cat doesn't have to be outside when the dog is inside, then the condition (A \u2192 B) is not met.\n- Since B (cat being outside) is not a necessary consequence of A (dog being inside), we cannot infer that A must be true or false based on the information provided about B.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot conclude whether",
