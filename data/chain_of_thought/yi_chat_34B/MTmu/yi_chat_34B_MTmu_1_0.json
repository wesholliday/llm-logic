            "content": "[RESP]Let's break down the information given step by step:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This is a conditional statement that tells us that if Mary's presence is true, then Sue's presence is also true. It can be represented as Mary \u21d2 Sue.\n\n2. It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. This means that Sue's presence is not necessarily true. In other words, it is possible for Sue to not have been at the wedding.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can conclude that:\n\n- If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would have had to be there as well (based on the first statement).\n- However, we know that Sue's presence is not necessarily true (based on the second statement).\n\nThis creates a logical contradiction because if Mary were at the wedding, it would mean that Sue must also be there, which contradicts the fact that Sue's presence is not necessary. Therefore, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: no, Mary was not at the wedding.<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP",
