The first statement is \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\" This is a conditional statement that can be represented as A \u2192 B, where A is 'the book was written by James' and B is 'the book must be a mystery novel.'\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\" This means that B (the book being a mystery novel) is false. In other words, we can say \u00acB.\n\n3. Now, we want to infer whether 'The book was not written by James' (which is \u00acA) can be inferred from the given information. To do this, we need to consider that if B is false and A \u2192 B is a valid statement, then A must also be false. This is because in a conditional statement, if the conclusion (B) is false, and the hypothesis (A) is true, then the entire statement would not be valid.\n\n4. Since we",
