This statement is in the form of an if-then proposition, where 'if' refers to the condition 'the shank was plooked' and 'then' refers to the consequence 'the shank was nugged'.\n3. To infer the reverse implication \"If the shank was nugged, then the shank was plooked\", we would need to know that the original statement is a biconditional (i.e., both an if-then and its converse are true).\n4. However, the information provided is only about one direction of the implication, not the reverse.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information alone, we cannot infer the reverse implication 'If the shank was nugged, then the shank was plooked'.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
