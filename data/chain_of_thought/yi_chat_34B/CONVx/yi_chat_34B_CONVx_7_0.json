In a conditional statement, the converse is formed by switching the antecedent (the 'if' part) with the consequent (the 'then' part).\n\nHowever, just because A \u2192 B is true does not necessarily mean that the converse B \u2192 A is also true. This is because the converse relies on a logical fallacy known as the \"affirming the consequent.\" In other words, knowing that if A occurs, then B must occur does not guarantee that if B occurs, A must have occurred. There could be other reasons for B to occur without A being the cause.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided by the original statement, we cannot logically infer that \"",
