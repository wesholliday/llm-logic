This would be the converse of the original statement, not the contrapositive. The converse of a conditional statement is obtained by switching the positions of the hypothesis and the conclusion, but it does not necessarily follow that the converse is true if the original statement is true.\n\nIn this case, we cannot infer B \u2192 A from A \u2192 B because the truth of \"If the flug was blummed, then",
