We are asked whether we can infer \"If the splat quanked, then the splat was morphed\" from the given statement. This would be a reversal of the original condition and consequence.\n\nTo determine if we can infer the reversed proposition, let's consider the logical implications:\n\n- If the splat was indeed morphed, as stated in the first proposition, then it would necessarily follow that the splat quanked (because that's what the 'then' part of the original statement says).\n\n- However, the reverse does not logically hold. Just because the splat quanked doesn't necessarily mean it was morphed. There could be other reasons for the splat to quank that are unrelated to being morphed.\n\nTherefore, based on",
