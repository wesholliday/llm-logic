The statement can be represented as P \u2192 Q, which means if P is true, then Q must also be true.\n\nNow, we are asked to infer whether \"If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was crampled\" is true. This would be represented as Q \u2192 P. The question is essentially asking if the consequent (Q) can imply the antecedent (P).\n\nIn a conditional statement like this, the antecedent (P) does not necessarily have to be true for the entire statement to be true; it only needs to be true when the consequent (Q) is true. However, just because Q is true does not mean that P must also be true. For example, if we have the conditional statement \"If it rains, then the grass gets wet\" (R \u2192 W), knowing",
