This would be represented as B \u2192 A.\n\nIn logic, the reverse of a conditional statement is not always true unless there is additional information that guarantees it. For example, if we know that \"if the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged\" and we also know that \"if the smonk plagged, then the smonk was vreebled,\" then we have a biconditional statement A \u2194 B, which means that A and B are equivalent.\n\nHowever, without any additional information or context, we cannot infer that if the smonk plagged, it must have been vreebled first. The original statement only tells us that if",
