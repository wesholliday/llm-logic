Just because we know that if P is true, then Q must be true (P \u2192 Q), it does not automatically follow that if Q is true, then P must also be true (Q \u2192 P). This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent or the converse error.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was cranked,\" we would need additional information about the relationship between being cranked and being daggled.
