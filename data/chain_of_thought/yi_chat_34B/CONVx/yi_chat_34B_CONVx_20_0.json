In other words, knowing that if A happens, then B must also happen does not necessarily mean that if B happens, A must have happened first.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement alone, we cannot infer \"If the fleeg surned, then it was bluttered.\" The answer is 'no'<|im_end|>\nAnswer: no<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No, we cannot infer 'If the fleeg surned, then it was bluttered' from the given statement 'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned' without additional information.",
