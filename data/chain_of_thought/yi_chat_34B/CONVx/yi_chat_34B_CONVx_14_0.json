This new statement is also a conditional, where 'clug snugging' is now the condition and 'clug being fleeked' is the consequence.\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two conditions and their corresponding consequences. In classical logic, an implication (if-then statement) is considered true unless the condition is true while the consequence is false. This is known as the contrapositive rule.\n\nIn our case, if 'clug snugging' implies 'clug being fleeked,' then the converse implication ('clug being fleeked' implying 'clug snugging') would also be true unless we can find a situation where '",
