In a conditional statement, the converse is formed by switching the antecedent (the 'if' part) with the consequent (the 'then' part).\n\nHowever, just because A \u2192 B does not necessarily mean that B \u2192 A. The converse of a conditional statement is not always true unless the original statement is a biconditional, which would imply that A and B are equivalent (A <-> B). This means that if A occurs, B must occur, and vice versa.\n\nSince we only have information about what happens when the twonk is plinked (it gets varnished), we cannot definitively say what happens when the twonk is varn",
