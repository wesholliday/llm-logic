In other words, knowing that if P then Q does not automatically mean that if Q then P.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided by the original statement \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened,\" we cannot logically infer that \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was vroombed.",
