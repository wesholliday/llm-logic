            "content": "[RESP]To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure and see if it follows a valid logical pattern. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Understanding Premises**: The first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there too. This suggests a conditional relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence.\n\n2. **Considering the Second Premise**: The second premise says that Sue might not have been at the wedding. This introduces a possibility that contradicts the first premise (if Mary were there, then so would Sue).\n\n3. **Evaluating the Conclusion**: The conclusion states that Mary was not at the wedding. This is based on the assumption that if Sue wasn't there, then Mary couldn't have been there either because of the first premise.\n\n4. **Identifying the Logical Structure**: The argument seems to be structured in a way where the conclusion negates the possibility of Mary being at the wedding based on the second premise, which is a potential counterexample to the first premise.\n\n5. **Assessing Validity**: A logically valid argument is one where the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises",
