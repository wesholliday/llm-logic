The second premise says that the book might not be a mystery novel (disjunctive statement: Not B or C).\n3. To determine the validity of the argument, we need to consider the truth values of each premise and whether they logically lead to the conclusion.\n4. If the first premise is true (the condition leads to B) and the second premise is also true (Not B or C), then there are two possibilities: either the book is not a mystery novel (C), or it was not written by James (Not A).\n5. The conclusion states that the book was not written by James. If we assume that the first premise is true and the second premise is true, then the conclusion could be true as well, because if the book is not a mystery novel, it does not necessarily follow that it was not written by James (the condition might still be met).\n6. Therefore, based on the given premises, the argument is not logically valid, because the truth",
