This is a conditional statement where \"vampire being awake\" is the antecedent and \"mummy being awake\" is the consequent.\n\n2. The second premise says that the mummy might not have been awake. This suggests that there is a possibility that the mummy was not awake, but it does not provide certainty either way.\n\n3. The conclusion states that the vampire was not awake. This is based on the assumption that if the mummy was not awake (which is a possibility according to the second premise), then the vampire must also not have been awake because of the first premise's conditional statement.\n\nTo determine the logical validity of this argument, we need to assess whether the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. In this case, the argument is based on a possible but unconfirmed state of affairs for the mummy (not being awake) and then concludes that the vampire must also not have been awake because of the conditional relationship established in the first premise.\n\nHowever, there is an issue with this logic. The second premise only provides",
