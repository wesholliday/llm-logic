Let's break down the argument:\n\n1. The first premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. This is a conditional statement in the form of an if-then statement. It can be represented as A \u2192 B, where A is 'the apple was red' and B is 'the banana must have been yellow'.\n\n2. The second premise says that the banana might not have been yellow. This suggests that the condition (A \u2192 B) might not be true, as it implies that B (the banana being yellow) may not follow from A (the apple being red).\n\n3. The conclusion states that the apple was not red. This is a claim about the negation of A.\n\nThe argument seems to be trying to establish that because the banana might not have been yellow, which contradicts the first premise's condition (A \u2192 B), therefore the antecedent (A) must be false. However, this does not necessarily follow. The second premise only says 'm",
