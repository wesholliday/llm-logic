Let's break down the argument:\n\n1. The first premise states that 'If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue'. This is a conditional statement where 'the car being red' is the antecedent (A) and 'the truck being blue' is the consequent (B). We can represent this as A \u2192 B.\n\n2. The second premise says that 'The truck might not have been blue'. This suggests that the truth of the first premise's consequent (B) is uncertain.\n\n3. The conclusion states that 'The car was not red'. This directly contradicts the antecedent (A) of the first premise.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical rules:\n\n- A conditional statement is true unless we can find a case where the antecedent is true and the consequent is false.\n- If the truth of the consequent is uncertain, as stated in the second premise, then we cannot be certain that the conditional statement (",
