The truck was not blue.\n2. If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the truck is not blue. This does not provide any information about the color of the car.\n\nFrom statement 2, we have a conditional statement: if the car is red, then the truck is blue. Since we already know from statement 1 that the truck is not blue, this condition (the truck being blue) cannot be true. However, the truth value of the 'if' part (the car being red) remains unaddressed by the information given in statement 1.\n\nTo infer 'The car was not red,' we would need to know that the 'then' part of the conditional is false (the truck is not blue) and also know that the 'if' part is false (the car is not red). We only have evidence for one half of this logical connection.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer with certainty that 'The",
