If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n\nWe are asked to determine if we can infer 'The book was not written by James' from these two statements.\n\nFirst, let's consider statement 2: If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. This is a conditional statement where \"the book being written by James\" is the condition that must be true for the conclusion \"the book is a mystery novel\" to follow.\n\nNow, we know from statement 1 that the book is not a mystery novel. Since the condition (James writing the book) would lead to a contradiction with what we already know (the book is not a mystery novel), we can conclude that the condition must not be true. In other words, James cannot have written the book.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer 'The book was not written by James'.<|im_end|>\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Explanation:\n\nWe are given two statements:\n\n1.
