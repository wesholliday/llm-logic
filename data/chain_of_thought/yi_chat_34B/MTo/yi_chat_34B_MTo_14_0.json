If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n\nWe are asked to infer whether the bear was not in the cave based on these two statements.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the wolf is not in the den. This means that wherever the wolf is, it is not in the den.\n\nStatement 2 introduces a conditional relationship: if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf must be in the den. However, since we already know from statement 1 that the wolf is not in the den, this conditional statement (the \"if\" part) cannot be true. If the \"if\" part of a conditional statement is false, the whole conditional statement is considered to be false.\n\nTherefore, because the conditional statement in statement 2 is false, we cannot infer anything about the bear's location in the cave based on the information provided. We can only conclude that the wolf is not in the den, but we do not have enough information to determine whether the bear is in the cave or not.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>",
