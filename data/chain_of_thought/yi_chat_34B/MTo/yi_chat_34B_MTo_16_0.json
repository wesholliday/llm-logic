If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the pants are not made of denim. This means that whatever material the pants are made of, it is not denim.\n\nStatement 2 introduces a conditional relationship between the shirt and the pants. It says that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants would be denim. However, since we already know from statement 1 that the pants are not denim, this condition (the pants being denim) is not met. Therefore, the entire conditional statement is false, which means that the shirt cannot be cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[THINK]To further clarify our reasoning, let's consider a truth table for the conditional statement \"If A, then B\":\n\nA | B | A \u2192 B\n----------\nT | T |   T\nT | F |   F\nF | T |   T\nF | F |   T\n\nIn our case, we have that A (the shirt being",
