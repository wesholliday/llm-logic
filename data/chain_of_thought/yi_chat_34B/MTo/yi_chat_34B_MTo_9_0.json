The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is met, then the consequence (Mark buying the blue shirt) follows.\n\nNow, since we know from fact 1 that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, we can conclude that the consequence of the conditional statement did not happen. Therefore, the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) must also not have happened, because if it had happened, the consequence would have followed.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RE",
