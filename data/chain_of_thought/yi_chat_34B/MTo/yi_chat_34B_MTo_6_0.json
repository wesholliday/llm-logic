It tells us that Bob's choice was not pasta.\n2. \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is a conditional statement. It establishes a logical relationship between Sue's choice and Bob's choice: if one condition (Sue choosing pizza) is true, then the other condition (Bob choosing pasta) must also be true.\n\nNow, let's consider what we can infer from these statements:\n\n- If Sue chose pizza, then according to the conditional statement, Bob would have chosen pasta.\n- However, we are also told that \"Bob did not choose pasta\".\n\nThese two pieces of information contradict each other. If Sue choosing pizza would mean that Bob chose pasta, and we know that Bob did not choose pasta, then it must be true that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[THINK]To determine whether we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza from the given information,",
