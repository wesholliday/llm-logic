We are also told that \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement as a conditional: If P (Mary being at the wedding), then Q (Sue being at the wedding).\n\nGiven that Q is false (Sue was not at the wedding), we can apply the contrapositive rule, which states that if the conclusion of a conditional is false, then the antecedent must also be false. In other words, if P implies Q and Q is false, then P must be false.\n\nTherefore, since Sue was not at the wedding (Q is false), we can conclude that Mary was not at the wedding (P must be false).\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
