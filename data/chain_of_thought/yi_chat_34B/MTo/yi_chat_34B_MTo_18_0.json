The truck was not metal.\n2. If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the truck is not made of metal. This means that the truck could be made of any material other than metal, such as plastic, wood, or something else.\n\nStatement 2 introduces a conditional relationship between the materials of the doll and the truck. It says that if the doll were plastic, then the truck would have to be metal. However, since we already know from statement 1 that the truck is not metal, this condition cannot be met. Therefore, the assumption that the doll is plastic leads to a contradiction with the known fact about the truck's material.\n\nTo resolve this contradiction, we must conclude that the assumption (the doll being plastic) is incorrect. Thus, we can infer that the doll is not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[THINK]To determine whether we can infer that the doll was not plastic from the given statements, let",
