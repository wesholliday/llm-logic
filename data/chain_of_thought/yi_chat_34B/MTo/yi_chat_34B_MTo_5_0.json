This scenario is consistent with the fact that \"Amy did not play tennis.\"\n- If Jeff played basketball, then according to the conditional statement, Amy would have had to play tennis as well. However, this contradicts the fact that \"Amy did not play tennis.\"\n\nSince we are given that \"Amy did not play tennis,\" which is a logical consequence of both scenarios (Jeff playing or not playing basketball), we cannot infer anything about Jeff's participation in basketball from the information provided.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and our reasoning, we cannot conclude whether Jeff",
