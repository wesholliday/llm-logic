According to the rules of logic, when the consequent is false, the whole conditional statement is considered false, regardless of the truth value of the antecedent (Tom watching football).\n\nTherefore, since the conditional statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is false, we cannot infer anything about Tom's actions from it. We cannot conclude that 'Tom did not watch football' based on the information provided.<|im_end|>\n[ANSWER]Answer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[THINK]To determine whether",
