According to the logic of a conditional statement, if the consequent is false, we cannot determine the truth value of the antecedent (Joe going to the park).\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer whether Joe went to the park or not. We can only say that if Joe had gone to the park, Lucy would have gone to the zoo, but since Lucy did not go to the zoo, we cannot determine whether Joe went to the park.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Explanation",
