According to the logic of a conditional statement, if the consequent is false, then the entire conditional statement is considered false, and we can conclude that the antecedent (Ben eating pasta) must also be false.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer 'Ben did not eat pasta'.<|im_end|>\n[ANSWER]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[THINK]To determine whether we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta from the given statements, let's break them down and",
