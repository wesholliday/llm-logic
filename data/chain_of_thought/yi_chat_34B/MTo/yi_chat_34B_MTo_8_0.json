If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the mummy is not in an awakened state.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 2. This is a conditional statement where \"the vampire was awake\" is the antecedent (the part before 'then') and \"the mummy was awake\" is the consequent (the part after 'then'). According to this conditional, if the antecedent is true (if the vampire is awake), then the consequent must also be true (the mummy would be awake).\n\nHowever, we already know from statement 1 that the mummy is not awake. Since the consequent of the conditional does not hold (the mummy is not awake despite the condition being met), this creates a logical contradiction. In such cases, we can conclude that the antecedent (the vampire being awake) must also be false to avoid the contradiction.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and our reasoning, we can infer that:\n",
