If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the unicorn is not in the forest. This means that regardless of the griffin's location, the condition for statement 2 (that if the griffin is in the forest, the unicorn must also be) cannot be met. Since the unicorn's presence in the forest is a necessary condition for the implication in statement 2 to hold, and we know that the unicorn is not in the forest, we can conclude that:\n\n- The griffin being in the forest does not lead to the unicorn being in the forest.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer whether the griffin was or was not in the forest. We only know that if the griffin were in the forest, it would contradict the fact that the unicorn is not in the forest, which is a given.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>",
