The statement \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed\" presents two possibilities for the location of the missing sock.\n2. We are given that \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed,\" which means one of two things: either the statement about the laundry basket and under the bed is false, or the sock is in the laundry basket.\n3. Since we have been told that the part about the sock being under the bed is not true, the only remaining possibility is that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
