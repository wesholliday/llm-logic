The statement \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand\" presents two possibilities for the location of the notebook.\n2. We are given that \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand,\" which means one of two things: either the statement in point 1 is false, or the notebook is in the drawer.\n3. Since we have already established that there are only two possibilities (the notebook being in the drawer or on the nightstand) and we have eliminated one of them (it's not on the nightstand), the only remaining possibility is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
