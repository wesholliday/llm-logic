The first statement is an \"or\" proposition: 'Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry'. This means that one of two possibilities must be true, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is a negation: 'It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry'. This means that the second possibility from the first statement (that the cookies are hidden in the pantry) is false.\n\n3. Since we have established that the second possibility is false, we can conclude that the only remaining possibility from the first statement must be true. That is, 'The cookies are in the jar'.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Yes<|im_end|>\n",
