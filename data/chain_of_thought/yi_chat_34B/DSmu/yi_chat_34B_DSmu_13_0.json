The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" tells us that there are only two possible locations for the toy: the toy box or the bookshelf.\n2. The second statement, \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" means that we can rule out the bookshelf as a possible location for the toy.\n3. Since there are only two options given and one of them (the bookshelf) has been eliminated, the only remaining option is that the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
