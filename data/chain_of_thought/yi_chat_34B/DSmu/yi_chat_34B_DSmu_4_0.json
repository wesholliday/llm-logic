We are given that it's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom. This means that the second possibility is ruled out.\n3. Since there are only two options presented, and one of them (playing in the bedroom) has been eliminated, the only remaining option is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
