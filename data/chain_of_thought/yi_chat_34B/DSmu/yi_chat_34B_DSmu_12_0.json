The statement \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" presents two possibilities for the location of the jacket.\n2. We are given that \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet,\" which means one of two things: either the statement about the jacket being hung in the closet is false, or it is true but there is some other reason why it does not have to be hanging in the closet.\n3. Since we are told that the jacket cannot be hanging in the closet, the only remaining possibility for its location is that it is draped over the chair.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can infer:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\nThe jacket must be draped over the chair because it cannot be hanging in the closet as per our given information.<|im_end|>\n\n",
