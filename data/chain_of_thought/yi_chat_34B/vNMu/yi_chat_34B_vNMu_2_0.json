This means that the possibility of the griffin being in the forest is denied.\n2. The conclusion says that the griffin might not have been in the forest. This implies that there is a chance, but not a certainty, that the griffin was not in the forest.\n3. Logically, if we deny the necessity of something happening (it's not mandatory), then it follows that there is a possibility for it not to happen.\n4. Therefore, since the premise denies the necessity of the griffin being in the forest, the conclusion that the griffin might not have been in the forest is a logical consequence of the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
