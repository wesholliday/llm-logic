This means that there is a possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is that Lisa might not have bought the red shirt. This directly follows from the premise, as it confirms the possibility mentioned in the premise.\n3. Since the premise establishes a potential scenario where Lisa did not buy the red shirt, and the conclusion merely states that this potential scenario exists, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
