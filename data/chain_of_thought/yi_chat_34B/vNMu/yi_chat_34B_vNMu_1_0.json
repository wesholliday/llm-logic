            "content": "\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. The argument states that it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding. This means that the premise is denying a necessity, suggesting that there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\n2. The conclusion of the argument says that Mary might not have been at the wedding. \"Might\" implies a possibility, which aligns with the premise's denial of certainty.\n\n3. Logically, if we can establish that something is possible (not necessarily true), then it remains within the realm of logical possibilities. The premise sets up this possibility by denying necessity, and the conclusion simply affirms that this possibility exists.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the reasoning above, the argument form seems to be logically valid because it maintains a consistent relationship between the premise (a denial of certainty) and the conclusion (an affirmation of possibility).\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
