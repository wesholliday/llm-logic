The conclusion suggests that it is possible for the watch not to be charging on the dresser.\n3. Logically, if something is not necessarily true, then it is possible for it to be false.\n4. Therefore, since the premise asserts that it's not necessary for the watch to be charging on the dresser, the conclusion that it might not be charging there is a logical possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
