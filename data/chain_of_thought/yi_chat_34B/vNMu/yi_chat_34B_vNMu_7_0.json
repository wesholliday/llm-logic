This means that there is a possibility that Alex did not finish the race.\n2. The conclusion says that Alex might not have finished the race. This directly aligns with the possibility mentioned in the premise, as it implies that there is a chance for Alex not to have finished the race.\n3. Since the premise covers the possibility of Alex not finishing the race, and the conclusion states the same possibility, the argument does not introduce any new information or make a leap that is not supported by the premise.\n4. Therefore, given the logical connection between the premise and the conclusion, where the premise sets a condition for which the conclusion is a direct consequence, the argument is logically valid.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n",
