This means that there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza.\n2. The conclusion suggests that Sue might not have chosen pizza. This is consistent with the premise because if we know there's a possibility that Sue didn't choose pizza, then it follows logically that she might not have chosen pizza.\n3. Therefore, given the premise and the conclusion, the argument is logically valid because it correctly infers a possible outcome from the stated condition.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n",
