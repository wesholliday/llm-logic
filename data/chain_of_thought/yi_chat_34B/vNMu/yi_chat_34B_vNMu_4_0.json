This aligns with the premise because if we accept that the alien's visit to Mars is not a necessary truth (as indicated by the premise), then it follows logically that there is a possibility that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\n3. The form of argument seems to be using a modus tollens structure: If P, then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P. In this case, P would represent \"The alien visited Mars,\" and Q would represent \"It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars.\"\n\n4.
