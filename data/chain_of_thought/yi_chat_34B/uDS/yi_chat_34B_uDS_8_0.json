Since there are only two options and one of them has been eliminated, we can logically conclude that the remote control must be in the remaining location.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. We know that the remote control is either on the coffee table or under the couch.\n2. We are told that it is not hiding under the couch.\n3. Therefore, since both options cannot be true (it can't be both on the coffee table and under the couch) and one option has been proven false (not under the couch), we must conclude that the remote control is in the only remaining location: on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1.
