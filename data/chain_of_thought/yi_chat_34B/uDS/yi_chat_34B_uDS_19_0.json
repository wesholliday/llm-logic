The statement says \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist.\" This means that there are only two possible locations for the watch: on the dresser, charging, or on his wrist.\n\n2. The statement also says \"the watch isn't on his wrist.\" This eliminates one of the possibilities, leaving us with only one option: the watch must be on the dresser, charging.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can infer that the watch is indeed charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes",
