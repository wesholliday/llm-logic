This is a statement of exclusivity; the milk cannot be both on the counter and chilling in the fridge at the same time. It must be one or the other.\n\n2. The milk isn't chilling in the fridge. This directly contradicts the first statement, as it eliminates one of the two possible locations for the milk.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can logically infer that since the milk is not chilling in the fridge and it cannot be both on the counter and in the fridge, it must be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n",
