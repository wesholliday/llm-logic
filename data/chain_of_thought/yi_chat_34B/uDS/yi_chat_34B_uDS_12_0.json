The statement \"the jacket isn't hanging in the closet\" eliminates one of those possibilities.\n3. Since both options cannot be true at the same time (a jacket cannot be both draped over a chair and hanging in the closet), we can conclude that if it is not hanging in the closet, then it must be draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]\nStep by Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The statement \"the jacket isn't hanging in the closet\" tells us that one of the possibilities for the location of the jacket is not true.\n2. Since there are only two options given, and we know that one of them must be true, we can eliminate the option that is explicitly stated as false (hanging in the closet).\n3. The only remaining option is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n",
