In other words, can we logically conclude that if the dreb was not spended, it must have been vroombed?\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the possible states of the dreb: It could be either vroombed or not vroombed, and it could be either spended or not spended. The original statement tells us that if a dreb is vroombed, then it is not spended. However, it does not provide any information about what happens when a dreb is *not* vroombed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty whether a dreb that was not spended must have been vroombed or not. The original statement only establishes",
