This can be represented as A \u2192 B in symbolic logic, where A represents 'the fleeg was bluttered' and B represents 'it did not surn'.\n\nWe are asked to infer the reverse conditional: If B, then \u00acA. In other words, if the fleeg surned (B), then it must be true that the fleeg was not bluttered (\u00acA).\n\nTo establish this inference, we need to ensure that the original statement is logically consistent with the proposed inference. If A \u2192 B is true, then by contraposition, \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA is also true. Contraposition is a valid logical equivalence that states that if one condition implies another, then the negation of the second condition implies the negation of the first.\n",
