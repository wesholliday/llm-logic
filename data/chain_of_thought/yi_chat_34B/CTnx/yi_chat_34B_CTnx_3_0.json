In logic, the converse of a conditional statement is another conditional with the antecedent and consequent flipped. However, it does not necessarily follow from the truth of the original statement that the converse is also true.\n\nTo determine if the converse is true, we would need to know more about the relationship between 'morphing' and 'quanking.' If there is a direct logical connection between these two actions (such as a law of nature or a defined rule) that guarantees that when one occurs, the other does not, then the converse might be true. However, without such information, we cannot definitively say that if the splat quank, it was not morphed.\n\nIn conclusion",
