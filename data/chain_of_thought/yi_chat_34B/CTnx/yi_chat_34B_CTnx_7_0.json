In a hypothetical situation where both implications are true, it would mean that whenever A is true, B must be false (A -> B), and conversely, whenever B is true, A must be false (B -> A).\n\nHowever, the problem with this inference is that it assumes that the original statement covers all possible scenarios for the whiffle's behavior. It might be the case that there are other situations where the whiffle could tink without being shanked or vice versa. The original statement does not provide information about these other scenarios.\n",
