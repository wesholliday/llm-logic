In a hypothetical situation where both implications are true, it would mean that when A is true, B must also be true (A -> B), and conversely, when B is true, A must also be false (B -> A).\n\nHowever, this would create a logical contradiction because if A -> B and B -> A are both true, then whenever A is true, it would imply both that B is true and that A is not true, which is impossible. Therefore, at least one of the implications must be false.\n\nSince we know that A -> B (the glip",
