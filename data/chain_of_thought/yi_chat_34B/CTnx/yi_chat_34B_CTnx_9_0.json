This can be represented as \u00acA \u2192 \u00acB.\n\nNow, according to the rules of logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if A \u2192 B is true, then so is \u00acA \u2192 \u00acB.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information that \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was not varnished,\" we can infer that \"If the twonk was varnished, then it was not plinked.\"<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESET]Resetting the conversation.
