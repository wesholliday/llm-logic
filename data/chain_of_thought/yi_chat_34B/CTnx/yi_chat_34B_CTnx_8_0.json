In other words, if the sprocket is cranked, it cannot be daggled at the same time.\n\nNow, we are asked to infer the opposite implication: \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\" (D \u2192 \u00acA). This would mean that whenever D (the sprocket is daggled) is true, A (the sprocket is cranked) must be false.\n\nHowever, there is no information provided about what happens when the sprocket is daggled. The given statement only tells us that if the sprocket is cranked, it cannot be daggled; it does not tell us anything about what happens when the sprocket",
