In other words, if we know that A -> B is true, we cannot conclude that B -> A is also true without additional information. This is because the truth table for implications allows for situations where A is true and B is false, which would make B -> A false.\n\nIn this case, we do not have any additional information to determine the truth value of \"the flugel was zargled\" or \"the flugel was blimmed.\" Therefore, based on the given statement alone, we cannot infer the",
