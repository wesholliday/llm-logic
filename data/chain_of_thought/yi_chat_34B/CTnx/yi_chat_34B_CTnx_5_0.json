This would be represented as B -> A.\n\nHowever, the principle of logical inference does not allow us to directly conclude B from A just because we know that A implies B. The direction of the implication is important; it does not work both ways without additional information.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement alone, we cannot infer \"If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled\" because the relationship between being smoogled and being fraggled is one-way in the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END",
