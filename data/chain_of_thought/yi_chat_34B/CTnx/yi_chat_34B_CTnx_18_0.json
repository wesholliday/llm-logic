However, the law of contrapositive states that if A \u2192 B is true, then so is \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA, where \u00ac represents negation. This means that if it's true that if A happens, then B does not happen (A \u2192 \u00acB), then we can infer that if B happens, then A does not happen (\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA).\n\nIn our case, since the original implication A \u2192 B is given, we can infer its contrapositive \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA, which is equivalent to \"",
