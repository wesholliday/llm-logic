This would be represented as B \u2192 A.\n\nTo determine if we can infer B \u2192 A from A \u2192 B, let's consider the truth values of A and B:\n\n1. If A is true (the flug was blummed), then B must be false (the flug was not zimmed) according to our original statement.\n2. However, if we reverse this implication to B \u2192 A, it would mean that whenever B is true (the flug was zimmed), A must also be true (the flug was blummed).\n\nThese two statements are not logically equivalent because they do not have the same truth values in all possible scenarios.
