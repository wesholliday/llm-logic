This is a conditional statement where 'the grommet being sploffed' is the condition (if part) and 'the grommet not plopping the frink' is the consequence (then part).\n\nLet's denote the condition as P (for 'grommet was sploffed') and the consequence as Q (for 'grommet did not plop the frink'). So, the original statement can be represented as:\n\nP \u2192 Q\n\nNow, we are asked to infer the reverse implication: 'If the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed'. This would be represented as:\n\nQ \u2192 \u00acP",
