In logic, the contrapositive of A \u2192 B is (not B) \u2192 (not A).\n\nTo determine if we can infer the proposed statement from the given one, we need to ask ourselves: If B (the wug bimmed the zoint) is true, does it necessarily mean that A (the wug was flooped) is false? The given statement only tells us that when A is true, B is not true. It does not directly tell us what happens when B is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided by the given statement, we cannot logically infer the proposed statement \"If the wug bimmed the zoint, then the wug was",
