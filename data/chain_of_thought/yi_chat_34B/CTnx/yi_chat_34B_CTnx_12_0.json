The contrapositive is a logically equivalent form that flips both parts of the implication and then inverts them (A -> B is equivalent to ~B -> ~A). So, the contrapositive of \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint\" is \"If the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was not shripped.\"\n\nSince the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent (A ->",
