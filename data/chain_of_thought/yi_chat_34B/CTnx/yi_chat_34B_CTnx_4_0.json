In other words, can we conclude that if the fribble did not crink, it must have been snurgled?\n\nTo determine this, let's consider the truth values of A and B:\n\n1. If A is true (the fribble was snurgled), then according to the original statement, B must also be true (the fribble did not crink). This means that in some cases, when A is true, B is also true.\n\n2. However, we cannot determine from the given information whether B being true implies A being true. There might be situations where the fribble does not crink for reasons",
