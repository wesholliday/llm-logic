In other words, it reverses the logical relationship between the hypothesis and the conclusion.\n\nNow, let's consider the question at hand: \"From 'If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk did not plagged', can we infer 'If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled'?\" This is asking us to find the converse of the original statement. The converse would be: \"If the smonk did plag, then it was vreebled.\"\n\nHowever, the problem here is that we are not given the converse of the original statement; instead, we are asked",
