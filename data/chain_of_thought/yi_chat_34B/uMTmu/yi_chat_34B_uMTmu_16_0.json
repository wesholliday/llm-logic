This is a conditional statement where \"the shirt being cotton\" is the condition (if-part) and \"the pants being denim\" is the consequence (then-part).\n\n2. It's not the case that the pants must have been denim. This means that it is possible for the pants to be something other than denim.\n\nNow, let's consider what we can infer from these two statements:\n\n- If the condition (the shirt being cotton) does not lead to the consequence (the pants being denim) because the pants might not be denim, then the condition must not have been met (the shirt cannot be cotton).\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes",
