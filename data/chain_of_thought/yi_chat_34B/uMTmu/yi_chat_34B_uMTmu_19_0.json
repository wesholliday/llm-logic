This is a conditional statement where 'Tom watching football' is the antecedent (P) and 'Jen watching basketball' is the consequent (Q). The full statement would be 'If P, then Q.'\n\n2. It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. This means that the second part of the conditional statement (Q) is false. In other words, Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nNow, we can use the contrapositive rule to analyze this situation. The contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P.' Since we know that Q (Jen watching basketball) is false, according to the contrapositive, we can conclude that P (Tom watching football) must also be false.\n\nAnswer: no<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RE",
