It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\n3. Can we infer that the book was not written by James?\n\nFrom statement 1, we can see that if the book were written by James, it would necessarily be a mystery novel. However, from statement 2, we know that this is not the case; the book is not necessarily a mystery novel. This means that even though James might have written the book, it does not have to be a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's consider the third statement: Can we infer that the book was not written by James? Based on the information provided, we cannot definitively conclude that the book was not written by James because the statements only tell us about the relationship between James writing the book and it being a mystery novel, but they do not provide any information about who actually did write the book.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer whether the book was or was not written by James.<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: No<|im_end|>",
