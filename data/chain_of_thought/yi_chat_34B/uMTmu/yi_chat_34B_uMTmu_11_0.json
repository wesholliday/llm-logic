This is a conditional statement where \"cake being chocolate\" is the antecedent (A) and \"muffins being blueberry\" is the consequent (B). The full statement would be \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry. This means that the second part of the conditional statement (B) is false. In other words, even if the antecedent (A) were true, the consequent (B) would still be false.\n\nGiven that the consequent (B) is false regardless of the truth value of the antecedent (A), we cannot infer anything about the antecedent itself. The statement \"If A, then B\" does not allow us to make a conclusion about A when we know that B is false, especially since there's no information provided about any other possible consequences or conditions.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer that the cake was not chocolate.
