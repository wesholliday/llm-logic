            "content": "[RESP]Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This is a conditional statement where 'Joe going to the park' is the antecedent (A) and 'Lucy going to the zoo' is the consequent (B). The relationship between A and B is such that if A is true, then B must be true as well.\n\n2. It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This means that even though we were told that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy would go to the zoo, we now know that this condition (Lucy going to the zoo) is not met. In other words, B (Lucy going to the zoo) is false.\n\nGiven that B is false, we can use the contrapositive of the conditional statement to determine the truth of A. The contrapositive states that if B is false, then A must be false as well.\n\nTherefore, since we know that Lucy did not go to the zoo (B is false), we can conclude that Joe did not go to the park (A is false).\n\nAnswer",
