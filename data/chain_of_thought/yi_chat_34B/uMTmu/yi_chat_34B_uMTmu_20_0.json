It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the banana is not necessarily yellow. This means that the condition in statement 1 (\"if the apple was red\") does not guarantee that the banana will be yellow. Since the banana being yellow is a necessary consequence of the apple being red according to statement 1, and this consequence is not met (because we know the banana isn't necessarily yellow), we can infer that the apple must not have been red.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No response provided.
