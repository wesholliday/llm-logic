This is a conditional statement where 'griffin in the forest' is the antecedent (A) and 'unicorn in the forest' is the consequent (B). We can represent this as A \u2192 B.\n\n2. It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest. This means that the unicorn might or might not have been in the forest, but we know for sure that it's not a necessary condition.\n\nNow, let's consider what we can infer from these two pieces of information:\n\n- If A \u2192 B is true and we know that B is not necessarily true (B is false), then by contraposition, we can conclude that \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA must also be true. In other words, if the unicorn was not in the forest (\u00acB), then the griffin must not have been in the forest either (\u00acA).\n\nHowever, since we are told only that it's not the case that the",
