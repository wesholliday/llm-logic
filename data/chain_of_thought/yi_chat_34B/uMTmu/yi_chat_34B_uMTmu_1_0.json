This is a conditional statement where 'Mary being at the wedding' is the antecedent (P) and 'Sue being at the wedding' is the consequent (Q). We can represent this as P \u2192 Q.\n\n2. It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. This means that the statement 'Sue was at the wedding' is false. In other words, \u00acQ (not Q) is true.\n\nNow, we are asked to infer whether Mary was not at the wedding. To do this, we need to consider the relationship between P and Q in light of the information provided about Q.\n\nSince we know that \u00acQ is true, we can use the contrapositive rule which states that if P \u2192 Q is true, then \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP is also true. The contrapositive flips both the antecedent and the consequent and negates them. However, since we already know that \u00acQ is true, the contrapositive would give us \u00acP, which",
