This is a conditional statement where playing basketball (Jeff) is the antecedent, and playing tennis (Amy) is the consequent. It means that if the first part is true (Jeff plays basketball), then the second part must also be true (Amy plays tennis).\n\n2. It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis. This statement seems to contradict the first one because it implies that even though Jeff might have played basketball, it does not necessarily mean that Amy played tennis.\n\nNow, let's consider what we can infer from these two statements:\n\n- If Jeff did play basketball, then according to the first statement, Amy should have played tennis. But the second statement says that this is not the case (Amy didn't play tennis). This creates a logical inconsistency because both statements cannot be true at the same time.\n\n- Since we know that it's not the case that Amy must have played tennis (which means she did not play tennis), and we have a contradiction if Jeff played basketball, we can",
