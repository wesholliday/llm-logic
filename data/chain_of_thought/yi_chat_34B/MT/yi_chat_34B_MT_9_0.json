According to the conditional statement (A \u2192 B), if B is false, then A does not have to be true. In other words, just because Mark didn't buy the blue shirt doesn't necessarily mean that Lisa didn't buy the red shirt. It could still be the case that Lisa bought the red shirt and some other person bought the blue shirt (not Mark), which would make the conditional statement true.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer that 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: no<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Explanation: The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought",
