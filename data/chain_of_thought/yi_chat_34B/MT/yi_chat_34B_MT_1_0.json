            "content": "[THINK]To determine whether we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding, let's consider the given statements step by step:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (conditional statement).\n2. Sue was not at the wedding (contradictory information to the first statement).\n\nSince we have contradictory information, we need to reconcile these two statements. The first statement is a conditional: if A, then B. The second statement negates B: not B. Therefore, we can conclude that the condition A (Mary being at the wedding) did not occur, because if it had, B (Sue being at the wedding) would have been true according to the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[THINK]To further clarify our reasoning, let's use a truth table for a conditional statement 'If A, then B':\n\nA | B | If A, then B\n----------------\nT | T |   T    (If both A and B are true, the conditional is true)\nT | F |   F    (If A is true but B is false, the conditional is false)\nF |",
