If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. (Premise 1)\n2. The truck was not metal. (Premise 2)\n\nFrom Premise 2, we know that the second part of Premise 1 (the truck being metal) is false. Since an 'if-then' statement is only false when the antecedent (if part) is true and the consequent (then part) is false, we can conclude that either both parts are true or both parts are false.\n\nSince we know that the truck not being metal makes the entire 'if-then' statement false, it means that both the doll being plastic and the truck being metal cannot be true simultaneously. If one part of the 'if-then' is known to be false (the truck not being metal), then the other part must also be false (the doll being plastic).\n\nTherefore, we can infer from the given information that since the truck was not metal, the doll was not plastic.<|im_end|>\n",
