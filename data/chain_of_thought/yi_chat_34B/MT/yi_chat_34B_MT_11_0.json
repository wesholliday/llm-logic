The muffins were not blueberry (negation of the second part of the conditional statement).\n\nFrom these two statements alone, we cannot directly infer that the cake was not chocolate because the first statement is a conditional one, and we only have information about its possible consequence (the muffins being blueberry) being false. The truth or falsity of the condition itself (the cake being chocolate) is not explicitly stated in the second statement.\n\nHowever, if we were to add the assumption that the conditional statement is always true (i.e., if the cake is indeed chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry) and given that the second part of the conditional (the muffins being blueberry) is false, we can infer that the first part (the cake being chocolate) must also be false. This is because in a true conditional statement, if the consequence is false, then the condition must be false as well.\n\nSo, under the assumption that the conditional statement is always true and given that the muffins were not blueberry,",
