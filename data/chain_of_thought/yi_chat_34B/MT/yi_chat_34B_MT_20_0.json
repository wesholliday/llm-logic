If we know that Q (the banana was yellow) is false, then we can conclude that P \u2192 Q (if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow) must also be false because it implies Q.\n\nHowever, when we have a conditional statement of the form P \u2192 Q and we know that \u00acQ is true, we cannot directly infer \u00acP without additional information. The reason is that there are two possible scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: P is true, but because Q is false (and thus \u00acQ is true), P \u2192 Q is false due to the falsity of Q. This does not provide any information about whether we can conclude \u00acP from this alone.\n- Scenario",
