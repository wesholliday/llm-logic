It means that if the condition (the car being red) is true, then the consequence (the truck being blue) must also be true. This does not necessarily mean that if the truck is blue, the car must be red; it's a one-way implication.\n\n2. \"The truck was not blue\" is a statement of fact. It directly contradicts the possible consequence mentioned in the first statement. Since the consequence did not happen (the truck is not blue), we can conclude that the condition (the car being red) must also not be true.\n\n3. Therefore, based on the logical relationship between the implication and the known fact about the truck's color, we can infer that \"The car was not red\".<|im_end|>\n[ANSWER]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[THINK]To determine whether we can infer that the car was not red from the given information, let's break down the statements and",
