It can be represented as A \u2192 B, where A is the alien visiting Mars and B is the robot visiting Jupiter.\n\n2. \"The robot did not visit Jupiter.\" This statement tells us that B (the robot visiting Jupiter) did not happen.\n\nNow, we want to infer whether \"The alien did not visit Mars\" (not-A) can be concluded from these two statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, which states that if A \u2192 B is true, then not-B \u2192 not-A is also true, we can look at the second statement as not-B (the robot did not visit Jupiter) and see if it implies not-A (the alien did not visit Mars).\n\nHowever, the problem with this inference is that the first statement is a conditional \"if A then B\" but the contrapositive would require us to know that not-B has occurred.
