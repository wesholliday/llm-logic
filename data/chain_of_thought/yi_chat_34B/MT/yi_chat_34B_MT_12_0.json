According to this conditional statement, if A (Joe going to the park) is true, then B (Lucy going to the zoo) must also be true. However, we are given that B is not true (\"Lucy did not go to the zoo\").\n\n3. Since B is false and A \u2192 B is a conditional statement, we can apply the contrapositive rule, which states that if A \u2192 B is true, then B \u2192 \u00acA is also true, where \u00acA means \"not A.\"\n\n4. Applying the contrapositive to our original statement, we get: If Lucy did not go to the zoo (\u00acB), then Joe did not go to the park (\u00acA).\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>",
