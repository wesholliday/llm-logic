It means that if one condition (the griffin being in the forest) is true, another condition (the unicorn being in the forest) must also be true. This can be represented as A \u2192 B, where A is \"The griffin was in the forest\" and B is \"The unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\n2. \"The unicorn was not in the forest\" is a statement of fact. It means that B (the unicorn being in the forest) is false.\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can infer \"The griffin was not in the forest\" (A is false) from these two statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, which states that if A \u2192 B is true, then \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA is also true, we can infer something about the relationship between A and B when B is false. According to the contrapositive, if B is false, then \u00acA must be true. In other words, if the unicorn was not",
