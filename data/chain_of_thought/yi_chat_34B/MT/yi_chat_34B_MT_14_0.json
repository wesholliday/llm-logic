(Premise 2)\n\nWe are asked to determine if we can infer 'The bear was not in the cave' from these premises.\n\nTo do this, we can use a logical approach:\n\n- Premise 1 is an implication, which means that if the antecedent (the part before the 'then') is true, then the consequent (the part after the 'then') must also be true. In other words, if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf being in the den is a necessary consequence.\n- Premise 2 tells us that the wolf was not in the den. This directly contradicts the consequent of Premise 1.\n\nAccording to the law of non-contradiction, we cannot have both the antecedent and its contradictory (the negation of the consequent) being true at the same time.
