(Contradiction to Implication 1)\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the mummy was not awake. This directly contradicts implication 1, which states that if the vampire were awake, the mummy would be awake as well. Since we have evidence that the mummy is not awake, we can infer that the condition in implication 1 (the vampire being awake) must also not be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can conclude that:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
