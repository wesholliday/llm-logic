The crinel is considered the frontrunner for snarggle, followed by the nafiz, while the tomul is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates, if the nafiz isn\u2019t named snarggle, then if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle. Moreover, the crinel likely will be named snarggle and hence the nafiz likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be?",

This means that there is a high probability that the crinel will be named snarggle.\n2. If the crinel isn't named snarggle, then we move to the next strongest candidate, which is the nafiz. Since the nafiz is also considered strong, it is likely that the nafiz would be named snarggle if the crinel were not chosen.\n3. The statement says that if the nafiz isn't named snarggle, then the tomul will be. However, this assumes that neither the crinel nor the nafiz are chosen, which is less likely given their frontrunner and strong candidate statuses.\n4. Even though it is stated that the crinel likely will be named snarggle, we cannot definitively say that the nafiz won't be because there is still a chance, albeit smaller, that the nafiz could beat out the crinel.\n5. Therefore, while it is true that if both the crinel and the nafiz are not",
