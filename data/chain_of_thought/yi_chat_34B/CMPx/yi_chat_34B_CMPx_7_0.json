    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crastin, a nivet, and a jomial are the top bispets this breeding season. Breeders expect the crastin likely will birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, with the jomial birthing many fewer. These lead in birthing, so if the nivet doesn\u2019t birth the most offspring, then if the crastin doesn\u2019t, the jomial will. Moreover, the crastin likely will lead births and hence the nivet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the crastin doesn\u2019t lead births, the jomial will?",

If the crastin doesn't birth the most, then the nivet is expected to do so.\n3. The jomial is expected to birth many fewer offspring than the crastin and nivet.\n4. Since the crastin and nivet are likely to lead in births, the jomial is less likely to do so.\n5. If the nivet doesn't birth the most offspring, then if the crastin doesn't, the jomial will.\n\nNow, let's consider the question at hand: \"If the crastin doesn't lead births, the jomial will?\"\n\nBased on the information provided, we can infer that if the crastin does not lead in births (i.e., birth the most offspring), then it is likely that the nivet will, not the jomial. This is because the nivet is the second-most expected to have the most offspring, and if both the crastin and nivet do",
