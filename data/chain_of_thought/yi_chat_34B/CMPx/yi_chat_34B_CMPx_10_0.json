Market watchers expect the fantole likely will retain the top spot in downloads, followed by the dribban, with the cruggit download rate significantly lower. These lead the downloads, so if the dribban isn\u2019t the most downloaded, then if the fantole isn\u2019t, the cruggit will be. Moreover, the fantole likely will lead downloads and hence the dribban likely won\u2019t.

Market watchers expect the fantole likely will retain the top spot in downloads.\n3. The dribban is expected to follow the fantole in terms of download rates.\n4. The cruggit's download rate is significantly lower than the other two.\n5. If the dribban isn't the most downloaded, and the fantole isn't either, then the cruggit will be.\n6. The fantole is likely to lead in downloads, which implies that the dribban likely won't.\n\nNow, let's consider the question at hand: \"Is it likely that, if the fantole isn't the most downloaded, the cruggit will be?\"\n\nBased on the information provided, we can infer that since the fantole is expected to retain the top spot and the dribban is expected to follow, there is a high likelihood that neither of these apps will be overtaken by the cruggit.
