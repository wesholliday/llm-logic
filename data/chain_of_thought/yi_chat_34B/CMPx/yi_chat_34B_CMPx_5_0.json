The fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by the darpil, while the votal trails far behind. These lead the league, so if the darpil doesn\u2019t have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn\u2019t, the votal will. Moreover, the fraglen likely will lead the league and hence the darpil likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fraglen doesn\u2019t lead the league, the votal will?",

The darpil is expected to have the second-best record.\n3. The votal trails far behind, indicating it has a much worse record than the other two teams.\n4. These three teams lead the league.\n5. If the darpil doesn't have the top record, and the fraglen doesn't either, then the votal must have the best record.\n6. The fraglen is likely to lead the league.\n7. Since the fraglen is likely to lead the league, it's unlikely that the darpil will be second.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that:\n\n- It's very likely that the fraglen will have the best record.\n- If for some reason the fraglen doesn't have the best record, then it's less likely that the darpil will have the best record because the fraglen is more likely to lead than the darpil is.\n- Therefore, if the fraglen doesn't have the best record, and the darpil",
