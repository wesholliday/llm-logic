The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

The jantiz is the most qualified, followed by the cramen, then the sulect.\n3. If the cramen doesn't get the zulision, and since there are only two other applicants, if the jantiz doesn't get it, the sulect must get it by default.\n4. The text states that the jantiz is likely to get the zulision, which implies a high probability. If this is the case, then the cramen will not get it (because there is only one position available).\n5. However, the likelihood of the sulect getting the zulision depends on whether the jantiz does or doesn't get it. If the jantiz gets it, as expected, then the sulect definitely won't get it.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that while it is true that if the cramen doesn't get the zulision and the jantiz also doesn't, the sulect will",
