    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a dribbet, a vrendel, and a toffen lead this quarter\u2019s gadston sales. Market analysts expect the dribbet likely will retain the top sales spot, followed by the vrendel, with gadston sales for the toffen significantly lower. These dominate the gadston market currently, so if the vrendel isn\u2019t #1 in sales, then if the dribbet isn\u2019t #1, the toffen will be #1. Moreover, the dribbet likely will lead gadston sales this quarter and hence the vrendel likely won\u2019t lead sales. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the dribbet isn\u2019t #1 in gadston sales this quarter, the toffen will be #1?",

If the dribbet doesn't maintain the top spot, then according to the analysts, the vrendel would be next in line.\n3. Since the dribbet and the vrendel are expected to lead in sales, if the dribbet isn't #1, it's likely that the vrendel will be #1.\n4. The analysts also expect gadston sales for the toffen to be significantly lower than those of the dribbet and the vrendel.\n5. If the dribbet isn't #1 and the vrendel isn't #1, then by process of elimination, the toffen must be #1.\n6. However, we are told that if the vrendel isn't #1, then the toffen will be #1. This implies that there is no other significant competitor than the dribbet and the vrendel.\n7. Therefore, if the dribbet isn't #1, it's likely that the toffen will be #1",
