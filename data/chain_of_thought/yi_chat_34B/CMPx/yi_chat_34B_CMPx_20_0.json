    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trundle, a foopet, and a crangor are likely to be the top selling whippits. The trundle will likely be #1 in sales, followed closely by the foopet, with the crangor having significantly lower expected sales. These lead whippit sales, so if the foopet isn\u2019t the top seller, then if the trundle isn\u2019t, the crangor will be. Moreover, the trundle likely will lead sales and hence the foopet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trundle isn\u2019t the top selling whippit, the crangor will be?",

If the trundle isn't the top seller, then the foopet is likely to be #1 in sales.\n3. If neither the trundle nor the foopet are the top sellers, then the crangor will be.\n4. The foopet is expected to have significantly lower sales than the trundle.\n\nFrom these points, we can infer that:\n\n- It's unlikely for both the trundle and the foopet to not be the top seller because the foopet is only likely to surpass the trundle in sales if the trundle isn't already the top seller.\n- Since the crangor has significantly lower expected sales than both the trundle and the foopet, it's unlikely for the crangor to be the top seller unless neither the trundle nor the foopet are on the market or have very low sales.\n\nGiven these inferences, we can conclude that:\n\n- It is likely that if the trundle isn't the top selling whippit,",
