    "user_prompt": "Suppose a stribben, a vanoon, and a jentapp are applying to rent a bondle. The owner thinks the stribben is the strongest applicant, followed by the vanoon, while the jentapp seems much less qualified to rent a bondle. Since these are the only applicants, if the vanoon isn\u2019t selected, then if the stribben isn\u2019t selected, the jentapp will be selected. Moreover, the stribben likely will be chosen and hence the vanoon likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the stribben isn\u2019t selected to rent the bondle, the jentapp will be?",

If the stribben is not chosen, then the vanoon is the next strongest applicant.\n3. If neither the stribben nor the vanoon is selected, the jentapp would be chosen by default since there are no other applicants.\n4. The owner believes that the stribben will likely be chosen, which implies that the vanoon is less likely to be chosen.\n\nGiven these points, it seems logical to conclude that if the stribben isn't selected, the jentapp would indeed be more likely to be chosen since there are no other applicants and the owner has ranked the jentapp higher than the vanoon.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RE",
