    "user_prompt": "Suppose a flinker, a dringen, and a n\u00fcffen have the best projections to have a breakout season next year. Talent scouts believe it's highly probable the flinker will have a breakout season, followed closely by the dringen, while the n\u00fcffen is an outside shot. Since these are the only top prospects, if the dringen doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season. Moreover, scouts think the flinker will likely have a breakout season and hence the dringen likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will?",

The dringen is also highly probable to have a breakout season, but slightly less likely than the flinker.\n3. The n\u00fcffen is an outside shot to have a breakout season.\n4. If the dringen doesn't have a breakout season, and the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, then the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season.\n5. Since the flinker is likely to have a breakout season, the dringen is unlikely to have a breakout season.\n\nNow let's consider the question: If the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, is it likely that the n\u00fcffen will?\n\nBased on our reasoning above, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, then by the scouts' assessment, the dringen is unlikely to have a breakout season as well. This means that the condition for the n\u00fcffen to have a breakout season (both the flinker and the dringen not having a breakout season) is met. However, we",
