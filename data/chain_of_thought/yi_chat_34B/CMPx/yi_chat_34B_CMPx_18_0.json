Experts expect the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most this year, followed by the crongle, with the narzil bafwidging much less. These are the only major bafwidgers, so if the crongle doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, then if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will bafwidge the most. Moreover, the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most, and hence the crongle likely won\u2019t bafwidge the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will?",

If the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, then the crongle will be the one that bafwidges the most (since there are only three major bafwidgers and the narzil bafwidges much less).\n3. The experts believe that the blimfet is likely to bafwidge the most.\n4. If the crongle doesn't bafwidge the most, then the narzil will (because there are no other major bafwidgers mentioned).\n5. Since it's likely that the blimfet will bafwidge the most, it follows that it's unlikely that the crongle will bafwidge the most.\n\nNow, let's consider the question at hand: \"If the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, is it likely that the narzil will?\"\n\nBased on our reasoning above, if the blimfet doesn'",
