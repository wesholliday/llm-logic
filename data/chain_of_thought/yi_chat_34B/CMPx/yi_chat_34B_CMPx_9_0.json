The vringel is regarded as the most likely winner, followed by the nastil, while the joncul is considered a significant underdog. Since these are the only finalists, if the nastil doesn\u2019t win the prize, then if the vringel doesn\u2019t win, the joncul will win. Moreover, the vringel likely will win the prize and hence the nastil likely won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the vringel doesn\u2019t win the prize, the joncul will?",

If the vringel does not win, then the nastil is the next in line to win, as it is followed by the nastil.\n3. If neither the vringel nor the nastil wins, then by default, the joncul will win, as there are no other finalists.\n4. Since the vringel is likely to win and the nastil is considered a significant underdog, it's less likely that the nastil will win.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that:\n\n- It's likely that the vringel will win.\n- If the vringel doesn't win, then the nastil might win, but since the nastil is an underdog, it's less likely.\n- If neither the vringel nor the nastil wins, then the joncul will win by default.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly conclude from this that if the vringel doesn't win, the joncul will.
