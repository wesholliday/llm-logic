    "user_prompt": "Suppose a fantole, a dribban, and a snorpul have the best odds to win this season's Rizzle Cup. Oddsmakers believe it's most probable the fantole will capture the cup, followed by the dribban, while the snorpul is a heavy longshot. Since these are the only top contenders, if the dribban doesn\u2019t win the cup, then if the fantole doesn\u2019t win, the snorpul will win. Moreover, the fantole likely will win the cup and hence the dribban likely won't win. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantole doesn't win the Rizzle Cup, the snorpul will?",

The dribban is next in line with respect to winning probabilities.\n3. The snorpul is a heavy longshot, meaning it's least likely to win.\n4. If the dribban doesn't win, and the fantole doesn't win, then the snorpul must win (since these are the only top contenders).\n5. It's most probable that the fantole will win, which implies that it's less likely for the dribban to win.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: \"Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantole doesn't win the Rizzle Cup, the snorpul will?\"\n\nBased on our reasoning above, we know that if both the fantole and the dribban do not win, then the snorpul must win. However, we are only told that it's most probable for the fantole to win; we are not given specific probabilities or odds for each scenario. Without such information,",
