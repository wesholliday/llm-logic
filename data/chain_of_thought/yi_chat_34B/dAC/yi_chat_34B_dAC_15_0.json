Since we know that 'Erin took a train' is true, according to the conditional statement, 'Sam took a plane' should also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the validity of the conditional statement, we can deduce that 'Sam took a plane'.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
