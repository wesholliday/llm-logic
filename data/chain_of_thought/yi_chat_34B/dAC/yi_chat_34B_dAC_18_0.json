The contrapositive says \"if not Q, then not P\", and the inverse says \"if Q, then P\". However, since we only have information about Q being true, we cannot directly infer P without additional information or a specific rule that states that if the truck is metal, then the doll must be plastic (which is not provided).\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot logically deduce that \"the doll was plastic\" from the fact that \"the truck was metal\" and the",
