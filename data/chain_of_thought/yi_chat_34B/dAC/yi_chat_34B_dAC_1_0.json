We are given two premises:\n   - Premise 1: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n   - Premise 2: Sue was at the wedding.\n\n2. According to the first premise (Premise 1), if Mary were at the wedding, it would guarantee that Sue is also at the wedding.\n\n3. The second premise (Premise 2) tells us that Sue is indeed at the wedding.\n\n4. However, Premise 1 only guarantees the presence of Sue if Mary is present; it does not provide any information about whether Mary is actually present or not.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the given premises, we cannot deduce with certainty that Mary was at the wedding. We can only conclude that if Mary were at the wedding, Premise 1 would imply that Sue would be there too.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
