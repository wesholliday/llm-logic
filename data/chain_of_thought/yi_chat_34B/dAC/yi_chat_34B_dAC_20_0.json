However, in a conditional statement, the truth of the conclusion (Q) does not necessarily imply the truth of the premise (P). The relationship between the two statements is probabilistic; if P is true, then Q must be true, but the reverse is not always true.\n\nIn this case, knowing that the banana was yellow tells us nothing about whether the apple was red or not. The original conditional statement does not provide a guarantee that if the banana is yellow, the apple must also have been red. It could",
