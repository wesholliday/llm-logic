If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. (Implication 1)\n2. The pants were denim. (Fact)\n\nWe are asked to determine if we can deduce the shirt was cotton from these two pieces of information. To do this, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nStatement 1 is an implication that tells us something about what would be true if the shirt were cotton: that the pants would also be denim. Statement 2 provides us with a fact, which is that the pants are indeed denim.\n\nHowever, the fact that the pants are denim does not necessarily mean that the shirt was cotton. The first statement only tells us what would be true if the shirt were cotton, but it does not guarantee that the shirt actually is cotton. It's possible that the shirt could be made of a different material and the pants still be denim.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively deduce that the shirt was cotton just because the pants were denim.
