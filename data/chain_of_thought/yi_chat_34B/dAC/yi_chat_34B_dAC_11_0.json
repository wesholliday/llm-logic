It only tells us that if A were true, B would be true too.\n\nStep 5: Since we have no additional information about whether the cake was chocolate or not, we cannot definitively conclude that 'The cake was chocolate' based solely on the fact that 'The muffins were blueberry.'\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step 1:",
