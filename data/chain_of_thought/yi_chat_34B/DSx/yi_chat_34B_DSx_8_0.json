The statement \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it is daggled\" tells us that in any given situation, the sprocket must be in one of these two states - either cranked or daggled.\n\n2. We are also told that \"The sprocket is not daggled.\" This means that the second possibility mentioned in the first statement (being daggled) is not true for this particular situation.\n\n3. Since there are only two options given in the first statement, and one of them (daggled) has been eliminated as a possibility due to the second statement, then by process of elimination, the only remaining option must be true.\n\n4. Therefore, we can infer from the available information that \"The sprocket is cranked\" because it is the only alternative left after excluding the daggled state, which has been confirmed as not being the case.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
