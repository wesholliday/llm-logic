It implies that if the smonk is not one of these states, then it must be the other.\n\n2. \"The smonk is not plagged.\" This statement eliminates one of the possibilities presented in the first statement. Since we know the smonk is not plagged, according to the first statement, it must be vreebled.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]",
