The statement \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it is crinked\" tells us that in a logical OR relationship, the fribble must be either snurgled or crinked, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement, \"The fribble is not crinked,\" provides us with information about one branch of the OR relationship: it eliminates the possibility that the fribble is crinked.\n\n3. Since we are left with only one option in the OR relationship (the fribble cannot be both snurgled and crinked, and it is not crinked), we can conclude that the fribble must be snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
