It does not specify which condition is true, only that one of them is.\n\n2. \"The sneg is not sproted.\" This provides us with information about one of the possible states of the sneg. Since it is not sproted, we know that the other possibility must be true.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Explanation:\n\nSince we know from statement 2 that the sneg is not sproted, and statement 1 tells us that exactly one of the conditions must be true, we can conclude that the only remaining possibility is that the sneg is crampled. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that 'The sneg is crampled' is indeed true.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'The sneg",
