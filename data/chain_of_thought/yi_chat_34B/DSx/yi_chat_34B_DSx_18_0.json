It implies that if the shank is not plooked, then it must be nugged, and vice versa.\n\n2. \"The shank is not nugged.\" This statement eliminates one of the possibilities presented in the first statement. Since we know the shank is not nugged, according to the first statement, the only remaining possibility is that the shank is plooked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the logical deduction from the two statements, we can infer:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
