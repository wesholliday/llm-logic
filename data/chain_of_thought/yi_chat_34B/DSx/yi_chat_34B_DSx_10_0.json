It's an example of the logical principle of the excluded middle.\n\n2. \"The wug is not garpled.\" This provides us with information about one of the possibilities being false (the wug not being garled).\n\nGiven these two statements, we can use a process of elimination to determine the truth of the other possibility:\n\n- If the wug is not garpled, and it must be either sproinged or garpled, then by default it must be sproinged since the only other option has been eliminated.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n",
