It implies that if the flob is not skizzled, then it must be movated, and vice versa.\n\n2. \"The flob is not movated.\" This statement tells us that one of the possibilities mentioned in the first statement is false: the flob is not in a state of being movated.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can conclude that since the flob is not movated and it must be either skizzled or movated, then the only remaining option is that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
