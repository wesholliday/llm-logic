It implies that one of these conditions must be true.\n\n2. \"The fleeg might not be surned.\" This suggests that the second possibility mentioned in the first statement (the fleeg being 'surned') might not actually be the case.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can infer that if the fleeg is not 'surned' (as stated in the second condition), then it must be true that the fleeg is 'bluttered', because according to the first statement, one of those conditions has to be met.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
