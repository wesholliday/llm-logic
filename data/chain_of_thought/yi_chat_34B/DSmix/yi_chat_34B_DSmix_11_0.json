There are no other options given.\n\n2. \"The flug might not be zimmed.\" This statement indicates that state B (zimmed) may not be true.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that if the flug is not in state B (not zimmed), then it must be in state A (blummed), because there are no other options presented. Therefore, based on the information provided, yes, we can infer that \"The flug is blummed.\"<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response. Thank you for your question.
