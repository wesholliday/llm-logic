There are no other options given.\n\n2. \"The wug might not be garpled.\" This statement suggests that option B (being garpled) may not be true. If option B is not true, then according to the first statement, option A (being sproinged) must be true since there are no other alternatives presented.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can infer:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
