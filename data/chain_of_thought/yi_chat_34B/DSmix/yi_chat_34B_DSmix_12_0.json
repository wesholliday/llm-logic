It does not specify which of these two conditions is true, but it implies that one of them must be the case.\n\n2. \"The smip might not be lupped.\" This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the second condition mentioned in the first statement (that the smip must be lupped) is not true.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that if the smip is not lupped (as suggested by the second statement), then the only other possibility left is that it is shripped, as per the first statement. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can conclude that:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response. Thank you for your question.
