It sets up a logical OR condition between two possible states of the fribble.\n\n2. \"The fribble might not be crinked.\" This suggests that there is a possibility that the second option in the logical OR statement (it being crinked) may not be true.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that if the second option (crinked) is not true, then the first option (snurgled) must be true by default, because the statement says \"EITHER ... OR\" and since one possibility is eliminated, the other must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response. Thank you for your question.
