It implies that one of these conditions must be true.\n\n2. \"The clug might not be snugged.\" This suggests that the second option mentioned in the first statement (that the clug must be snugged) may not be the case.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that if the clug is not snugged, then it must be fleeked, because the first statement tells us that only one of these conditions can be true at a time. Therefore, based on the information provided, 'The clug is fleeked' is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response. Thank you for your question.
