It implies that if it's not one, it must be the other.\n\n2. \"The sprocket might not be daggled.\" This suggests that while there is a possibility of the sprocket being daggled, it is not certain.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that since the sprocket might not be daggled (and it's not an absolute certainty), and we know from the first statement that if it's not cranked, it must be daggled, then the only logical conclusion is that the sprocket must be cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled\" presents two mutually exclusive options for the state of the sprocket.
