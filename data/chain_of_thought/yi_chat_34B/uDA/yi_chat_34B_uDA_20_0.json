From statement (b), we know that the apple is not in the state described by 'red'.\n\n3. Statement (a) tells us that if the apple were in a different state ('red'), then the banana would be in a specific state ('yellow').\n\n4. Since the apple is not red as per statement (b), we can conclude that the condition described in statement (a) is not met.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer whether the banana is yellow or not based on the information provided. The only thing we know for sure is that the apple is not red.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]",
