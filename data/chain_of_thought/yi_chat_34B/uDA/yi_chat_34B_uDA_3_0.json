This statement establishes a conditional relationship between the authorship of the book by James and its genre as a mystery novel. It can be represented as \"If A (James writes the book), then B (the book is a mystery novel).\"\n\n2. The book was not written by James. This statement provides us with information about the actual state of affairs regarding the authorship of the book. It tells us that condition A (James writing the book) is false.\n\nNow, based on these two statements, we can apply the logic of conditional statements to determine whether we can infer anything about B (the book being a mystery novel).\n\nIn a conditional statement \"If A then B,\" if we know that A is false, then we cannot make any definitive conclusions about B. The relationship between A and B only tells us what would be the case if A were true; since A is not true in this scenario, we do not have enough information to determine whether B is true or false.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can conclude that",
