We are given two statements:\n   - If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n   - Joe did not go to the park.\n\n2. The first statement is an \"if-then\" statement, which means that if the condition (Joe going to the park) is true, then the result (Lucy going to the zoo) must also be true. However, it does not specify what happens when the condition is false.\n\n3. The second statement tells us that Joe did not go to the park, which means the condition in the first statement is not met.\n\n4. Since we do not have any information about what happens when the condition (Joe going to the park) is not met, we cannot infer anything about Lucy's actions based solely on the second statement.\n\n5. Therefore, without additional information, we cannot determine whether Lucy went to the zoo or not.\n\n[ANSWER]Answer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[THINK]\nTo answer this question, let's consider the following points step by step:\n\n",
