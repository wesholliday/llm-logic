This is a conditional statement where 'Tom watching football' is the condition for 'Jen watching basketball.'\n2. We are told that Tom did not watch football. This means the condition (Tom watching football) is not met.\n\nBased on the logic of the conditional statement, if the condition is not met, then the conclusion (Jen watching basketball) does not necessarily follow. Therefore, we cannot infer that because Tom did not watch football, Jen did not watch basketball. The original conditional statement only tells us what would happen if Tom *did* watch football, but it does not provide information about what happens when the condition is not satisfied.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END",
