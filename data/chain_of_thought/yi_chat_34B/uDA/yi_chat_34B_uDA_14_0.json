From the second statement, we know that the condition for the first statement (the bear being in the cave) is not met.\n\n3. Since the condition for the first statement is not met, we cannot conclude that the wolf was in the den based on the first statement alone.\n\n4. The second statement does not provide any information about where the wolf was or whether it was in the den.\n\nBased on the information provided, we cannot infer that the wolf was not in the den. We only know that the bear was not in the cave, which is not sufficient to determine the location of the wolf.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: no<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
