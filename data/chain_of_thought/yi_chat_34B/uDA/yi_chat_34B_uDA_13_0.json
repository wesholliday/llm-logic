This is a conditional statement that tells us something about the relationship between the color of the car and the color of the truck when the car is red. It does not provide any information about what happens if the car is not red.\n\n2. The car was not red. This tells us that the condition in the first statement (the car being red) did not occur.\n\nNow, since we know that the car was not red and the first statement only applies when the car is red, we cannot directly infer anything about the color of the truck from the information provided. The second statement does not give us any specific information about what color the truck is or isn't; it just tells us that the condition for the first statement to be true (the car being red) is not met.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer whether the truck was blue or not blue.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No",
