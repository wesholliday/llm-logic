The vampire was not awake (negation of the first statement).\n\nFrom these two pieces of information, we can infer the following:\n\n3. Since the vampire was not awake, the conditional statement from step 1 does not apply.\n4. Therefore, the mummy's state of being awake or asleep is independent of the vampire's state.\n5.
