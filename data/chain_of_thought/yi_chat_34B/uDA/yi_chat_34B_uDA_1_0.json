The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\" This means that if condition A (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then condition B (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true.\n\n2. However, we are also told that Mary was not at the wedding. Since one of the conditions in the conditional statement is not met (A is false), we cannot automatically conclude that B (Sue being at the wedding) is true.\n\n3. Therefore, based on the information given, we can only say that since Mary was not at the wedding, we do not have enough information to determine whether Sue was at the wedding or not. The absence of one condition in a conditional statement does not necessarily imply the absence of the other condition.\n\n[ANSWER]\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[THINK]\nTo determine whether we can infer that Sue was not at the wedding, let's consider the",
