We have two statements:\n   - If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned (conditional statement)\n   - The fleeg was bluttered (premise)\n\n2. To infer 'The fleeg surned' from these statements, we need to use the conditional statement as a rule or a principle that tells us what happens if the condition is met.\n\n3. Since the premise 'The fleeg was bluttered' satisfies the condition of the conditional statement, we can conclude that the fleeg must have surned according to the rule established by the conditional statement.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the given information and the logical relationship between the statements, we can infer 'The fleeg surned'.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
