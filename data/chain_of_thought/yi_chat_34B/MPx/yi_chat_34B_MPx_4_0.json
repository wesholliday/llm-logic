According to the rules of logic for conditional statements, if the premise (the part after 'if') is true, and the conclusion (the part after 'then') is true, then the conditional statement as a whole is considered true.\n\n3. In this case, we have the premise ('The fribble was snurgled') being true.\n\n4. Therefore, according to the rules of logic, since the premise is true and the conditional statement is true, we can infer that the conclusion (the part after 'then') must also be true.\n\n5.
