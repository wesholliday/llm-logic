We also have an additional piece of information: \"The shank was plooked\" (let's call this premise B).\n3. To infer 'The shank was nugged' from these premises, we need to apply the logical principle of modus ponens, which states that if you have a conditional statement and its antecedent (the part before the 'then') is true, then the consequent (the part after the 'then') must also be true.\n4. Since premise A is a conditional statement with 'The shank was plooked' as its antecedent, and premise B tells us that this antecedent is indeed true, we can conclude that the consequent of premise A ('The shank was nugged') must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
