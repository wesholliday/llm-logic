The first statement is \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\" This is a conditional statement that establishes a logical relationship between two events: morphing the splat and the splat quanking. It can be represented as 'M \u2192 Q', where 'M' stands for 'the splat was morphed' and 'Q' stands for 'the splat quanked'.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The splat was morphed.\" This provides us with evidence that the condition ('M') has been met.\n\n3. According to the first statement, if 'M' is true, then 'Q' must also be true. Since we know 'M' is true (from the second statement), we can infer that 'Q' must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information and the logical relationship established by the conditional statement, we can indeed infer that \"The splat quanked.\"<|im_end|>\n[END",
