(conditional statement)\n   - The grommet was sploffed. (consequent of the conditional statement)\n\n2. A conditional statement is true when its antecedent (the part before 'then') leads to its consequent (the part after 'then').\n\n3. Since we know that the grommet was sploffed, which is the antecedent of the conditional statement, we can consider whether it leads to the consequent.\n\n4. The consequent of the conditional statement is 'The grommet plopped the frink'.\n\n5. Given that the grommet was sploffed, and this condition (the grommet being sploffed) is necessary for the grommet to plop the frink, we can infer that the grommet did indeed plop the frink.\n\n6. Therefore, based on the truth of the conditional statement and the fact that the antecedent has been established (the",
