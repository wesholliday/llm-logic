According to the rules of logic for a conditional statement, if the antecedent (the part before 'then') is true, then the consequent (the part after 'then') must also be true.\n\n3. Since we know that the smip was shripped (which is the antecedent), we can conclude that the smip lupped the zoint (which is the consequent).\n\n4.
