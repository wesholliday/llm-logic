We are given another statement \"The twonk was plinked\" which tells us that the first part of the implication is indeed true.\n\n3. Since the first part of the implication is true, according to the rules of logic, the second part (it being varnished) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that \"It was varnished\".<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
