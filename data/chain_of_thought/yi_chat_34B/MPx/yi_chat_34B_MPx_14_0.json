(Premise 2)\n\n2. Premise 2 tells us that the condition described in Premise 1 is met (the clug was fleeked).\n\n3. Premise 1 establishes a conditional relationship: if A (clug being fleeked) then B (clug snugged).\n\n4. Since we know A is true (the clug was fleeked), according to the logic of a conditional statement, we can conclude that B must also be true (the clug snugged).\n\n5. Therefore, based on the given information and the logical relationship between the premises, we can infer 'The clug snugged'.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
