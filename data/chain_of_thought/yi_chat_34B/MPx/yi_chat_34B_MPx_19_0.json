We are also given that \"The smonk was vreebled\" (let's call this premise B).\n3. To infer 'The smonk plagged' from these premises, we need to use the transitive property of implication, which states that if A implies B and B implies C, then A implies C.\n4. In our case, we have that A (\"If the smonk was vreebled\") implies B (\"The smonk plagged\").\n5. Since premise B is given to us as true, we can consider it as a known fact and use it to infer the truth of C (also \"The smonk plagged\") from A.\n6. Therefore, based on premises A and B, we can indeed infer 'The smonk plagged'.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1. We have a conditional",
