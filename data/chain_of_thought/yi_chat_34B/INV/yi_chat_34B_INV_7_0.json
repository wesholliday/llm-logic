This can be represented as A \u2192 B.\n2. To determine if we can infer the reverse implication, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n3. In logic, the converse of an implication is not necessarily true unless it is explicitly stated or can be inferred from additional information.\n4. The statement 'If Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race' would be represented as \u00acA \u2192 \u00acB.\n5. Without any additional information or context, we cannot directly infer the converse of the original implication (\u00acA \u2192 \u00acB) from A \u2192 B alone.\n6. The relationship between finishing and not finishing a race for Alex and Chris is not given, so we cannot determine if one's non-finishing implies the other's non-finishing.\n7. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer 'If Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race' from 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the face",
