This is because in a conditional statement, if you swap the positions of the hypothesis (A) and the conclusion (B) and then negate both, you get the contrapositive.\n\nHowever, the question asks about the converse of the original statement, which would be: If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake. This is not the same as the contrapositive. The converse of A \u2192 B is B \u2192 A, which in this case would be \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the validity of the converse. Just because if A implies B does not mean that if B implies A. This is because the converse and the original statement are two separate logical relationships that need to be evaluated independently. There is no direct relationship between the truth of",
