            "content": "[SYS]To determine whether we can infer 'If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside' from the statement 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside', let's consider the logical implications of both statements.\n\nThe original statement is in the form of a conditional: If A (the dog being inside), then B (the cat being outside). This can be represented as A \u2192 B, where '\u2192' is the symbol for 'implies' or 'if-then'.\n\nNow, let's consider the proposed inference: If not A (the dog was not inside), then not B (the cat was not outside). This can be represented as \u00acA \u2192 \u00acB.\n\nAccording to the rules of classical logic, an implication (if-then statement) is false only when the antecedent (the part before '\u2192') is true and the consequent (the part after '\u2192') is false. In other words, if A is true and B is false, then A \u2192 B is false.\n\nHowever, when we negate a conditional, we reverse the truth values of its parts: \u00ac(A \u2192 B)",
