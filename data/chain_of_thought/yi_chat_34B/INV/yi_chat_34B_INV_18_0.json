The original statement is an \"if-then\" proposition, which means it follows a logical pattern where if one thing is true (the doll being plastic), then another thing must also be true (the truck being metal).\n\n2. However, the proposed inference inverts the original statement by negating both parts of the condition (doll not being plastic and truck not being metal). This creates a new \"if-then\" proposition with the opposite conditions.\n\n3. The problem with this inference is that it assumes a one-to-one correspondence between the properties of the doll and the truck, which may not be the case. Just because we know something about the doll does not necessarily mean we can infer the exact opposite for the truck.\n\n4. In logic, an \"if-then\" statement is only valid if it follows the pattern of material implication, where the truth value of the second part (the \"then\" part) is determined by",
