In a valid argument, the contrapositive is always true if the original conditional statement is true. However, we are only given the information that A \u2192 B is true; we do not have any information about whether A or B are true in isolation.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively conclude that \"If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den\" is true. We can only say that if A \u2192 B is true, then not(A) \u2192 not(B) must also be true, but without further evidence, we cannot assert the truth of the contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: yes",
