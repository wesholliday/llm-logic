In other words, whether or not Lisa bought the red shirt does not inherently determine whether Mark bought the blue shirt or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided by the original conditional statement, we cannot infer that \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"<|im_end|>\n",
