According to the rules of logic, if the original statement (A \u2192 B) is true, then its contrapositive (not A \u2192 not B) must also be true. This is because the truth table for a conditional statement shows that the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry,\" we can infer \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\" This inference is valid due to the logical equivalence of the contrapositive.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n",
