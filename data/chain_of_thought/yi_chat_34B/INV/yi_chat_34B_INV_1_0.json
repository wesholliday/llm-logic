It only tells us that if Mary is there, then so is Sue. We do not know whether the presence of Sue depends solely on Mary's presence or if there are other factors involved.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer with certainty that \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\" The relationship between Mary and Sue's attendance is one-way in the provided statement, from Mary to Sue, but not vice versa.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n",
