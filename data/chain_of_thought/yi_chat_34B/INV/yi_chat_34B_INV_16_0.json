This can be represented as A \u2192 B, where '\u2192' is the symbol for 'implies' or 'results in'.\n\nNow, let's consider the proposed inference: If not A (the shirt is not cotton), then not B (the pants are not denim). This can be represented as \u00acA \u2192 \u00acB, where '\u00ac' is the symbol for 'not'.\n\nThe principle of logical biconditional states that if A \u2192 B is true, then so is \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA. However, this inference would require the reverse implication to also be true: If not B (the pants are not denim), then not A (the shirt is not cotton), which can be represented as \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA.\n\nThe problem with making this",
