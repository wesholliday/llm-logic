The original statement is \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This is a conditional statement with 'being written by James' as the condition (P) and 'being a mystery novel' as the consequence (Q).\n\n2. We are asked to infer whether \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel\" can be inferred from the original statement. This new statement reverses the condition (now it's 'not being written by James') and the consequence (now it's 'not being a mystery novel').\n\n3. To determine if we can infer the reversed statement, we need to consider the logical structure of the conditional. In classical logic, a conditional statement is considered true unless there is a case where the condition is true but the consequence is false. This is known as the contrapositive, which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. Since the original statement is not stated in terms of its contrapositive, we cannot directly infer the reversed statement from it without additional information or assumptions. The truth of one does not necessarily imply the",
