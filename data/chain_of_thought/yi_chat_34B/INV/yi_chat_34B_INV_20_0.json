This can be represented as A \u2192 B, where '\u2192' is the symbol for 'implies' or 'if-then'.\n\nWe are asked to infer the reverse implication: If not A (the apple is not red), then not B (the banana is not yellow). This would be represented as not A \u2192 not B.\n\nIntuitively, it seems that if the apple is not red, we cannot conclude anything about whether the banana is yellow or not. The original statement only tells us what happens when the apple is red; it does not provide any information about what happens when the apple is not red.\n\nIn terms of logic, the reverse implication (not A \u2192 not B) would be true if and only if the original implication (A \u2192 B) is false. In other words, for the reverse implication to",
