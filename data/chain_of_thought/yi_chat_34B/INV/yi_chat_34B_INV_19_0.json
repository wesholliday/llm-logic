            "content": "[SYS]To determine whether we can infer 'If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball' from the statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball', let's consider the logical implications of both statements.\n\nThe original statement is in the form of a conditional: If A (Tom watches football), then B (Jen watches basketball). This can be represented as A \u2192 B, where A is the antecedent and B is the consequent.\n\nThe proposed inference is also a conditional: If not-A (Tom did not watch football), then not-B (Jen did not watch basketball). This can be represented as not-A \u2192 not-B.\n\nIn classical logic, an implication A \u2192 B is considered true unless A is true and B is false. In other words, if the antecedent is true and the consequent is false, the implication is false. However, when the antecedent is false, the implication is considered trivially true because any statement following a false condition will be considered true for the purpose of the logical relationship.\n\nNow, let's consider the proposed inference: not-A \u2192 not-B",
