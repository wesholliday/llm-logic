We only know that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo, but we do not know what happens when one of them does not fulfill their part of the condition.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer with certainty that \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\" The relationship between the two actions in the absence of each other is unknown.\n\nAnswer: no<|im_end|>\n",
