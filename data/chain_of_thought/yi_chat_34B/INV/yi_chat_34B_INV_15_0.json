In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if one statement is true, so is the other, and vice versa. However, this rule applies only when dealing with logical truths or falsehoods; it does not necessarily hold in real-world scenarios where there may be exceptions or additional information not provided.\n\nIn the context of this question, without any additional information about Sam and Erin's travel arrangements, we can infer that if the original statement is true (Sam took a plane implies Erin took a train), then its contrapositive must also be true (Erin did not take a train implies Sam did not take a plane).
