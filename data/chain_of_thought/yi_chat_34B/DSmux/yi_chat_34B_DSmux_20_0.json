It does not specify which of these two options is true, but only that one of them must be the case.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned.\" This statement negates the second possibility from the first statement, meaning we can now eliminate the option that the fleeg must be surned.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, what can we infer about the fleeg?\n\nSince we know that the fleeg is not required to be surned, and we have already eliminated the possibility that it must be surned, we are left with only one option: the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
