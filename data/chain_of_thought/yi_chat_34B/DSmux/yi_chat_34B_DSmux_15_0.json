It implies that one of these conditions must be true.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the dreb must be spended.\" This statement negates the second possibility from the first statement. If we remove the negation, the second statement would read: \"The dreb must be spended.\" By negating this, we are told that it is not true that the dreb must be spended.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that since the dreb cannot be spended (according to the second statement) and it must either be vroombed or spended (according to the first statement), the only remaining option is that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response. If you have any further questions or need assistance with another topic, feel free to ask!<|im_end|>\n",
