It does not specify which of these is true in reality.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled.\" This statement negates one of the possibilities from the first statement. Since we know it can't be both blimmed and zargled, and we now know it's not zargled, the only remaining option is that it must be blimmed.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Yes<|im_end|>\n",
