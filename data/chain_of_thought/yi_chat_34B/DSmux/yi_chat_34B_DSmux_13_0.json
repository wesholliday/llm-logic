It implies that one of these conditions must be true.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the glip must be tragged.\" This statement negates the second possibility from the first statement, meaning we can no longer consider the option that the glip must be tragged.\n\nGiven these two statements, we are left with only one logical possibility: since it cannot be tragged and it must be either slogged or tragged, the only remaining option is that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
