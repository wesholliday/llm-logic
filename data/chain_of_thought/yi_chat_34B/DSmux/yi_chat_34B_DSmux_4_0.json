It sets up a disjunction between 'the fribble is snurgled' and 'it must be crinked'.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked.\" This statement negates the second possibility from the first statement, leaving only one option standing: 'the fribble is snurgled'.\n\nGiven these two statements together, we can indeed infer that 'The fribble is snurgled' must be true, because all other options have been eliminated.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Yes<|im_end|>\n",
