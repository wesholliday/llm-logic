It implies that one of these conditions must be true.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the twonk must be plinked.\" This statement negates the second option from the first statement, meaning that we can no longer consider the possibility that the twonk must be plinked.\n\nGiven these two statements, we are left with only one option: The twonk is varnished. Because we have eliminated the possibility of the twonk being plinked, and since both options from the first statement cannot be false (as per the law of excluded middle), the only remaining truth must be that the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Yes<|im_end|>\n",
