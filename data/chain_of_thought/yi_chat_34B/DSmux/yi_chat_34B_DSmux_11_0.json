It implies that one of these conditions must be true.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed.\" This statement negates the second possibility from the first statement, leaving us with only one option: the flug is blummed.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can infer:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Explanation: Since we have established that the flug cannot be zimmed (based on the second statement) and there are only two options given in the first statement, it logically follows that the flug must be blummed. Therefore, we can infer 'The flug is blummed' from the provided information.<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Answer: yes<|im_end|><|im_end|>\n[SYS]Explanation: The second statement \"It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed\" directly contradicts the",
