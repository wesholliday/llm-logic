It implies that one of these conditions must be true.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped.\" This statement negates the second possibility presented in the first statement. If we take this as true, then the only remaining option is that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nBased on these two statements alone, we can indeed infer that \"The grommet is sploffed.\"<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Yes<|im_end|><|im_end|>\n",
