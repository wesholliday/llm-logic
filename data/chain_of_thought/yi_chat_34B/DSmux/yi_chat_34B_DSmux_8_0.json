            "content": "[SYS]To determine whether we can infer 'The sprocket is cranked' from the given statements, let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. The first statement says 'Either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled'. This is a logical disjunction, meaning that one of two possibilities must be true.\n\n2. The second statement says 'It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled'. This is a negation of the necessity of daggling the sprocket. In other words, it is possible for the sprocket to not be daggled.\n\n3. Since both statements are true and we know that one of the two possibilities in the first statement must be true, and we also know that 'It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled' (which means it can be but doesn't have to be), then the only remaining option is that 'The sprocket is cranked'.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer 'The sprocket is cranked'.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n",
