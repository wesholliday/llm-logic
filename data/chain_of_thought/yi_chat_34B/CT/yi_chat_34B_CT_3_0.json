The original statement is \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This is a conditional statement where 'A' represents \"the book was written by James\" and 'B' represents \"the book is a mystery novel.\" So, we can write it as A \u2192 B.\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\" This would be another conditional statement where 'A' still represents \"the book was written by James\" and 'C' represents \"the book is not a mystery novel.\" So, we are asked to determine if C \u2192 \u00acA is true given that A \u2192 B is true.\n\n3. To infer C \u2192 \u00acA from A \u2192 B, we would need to apply the contrapositive of the original statement, which is \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA. The contrapositive states that if the book is not a mystery novel (\u00acB), then the book was not written by James (\u00acA).\n\n4. However, the question asks about C \u2192",
