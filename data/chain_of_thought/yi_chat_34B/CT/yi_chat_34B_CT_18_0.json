            "content": "[SYS]To determine whether we can infer 'If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic' from the statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal', let's consider the logical implications of both statements.\n\nThe original statement is in the form of a conditional: If A (the doll is plastic), then B (the truck is metal). This can be represented as A \u2192 B, where '\u2192' is the symbol for 'implies' or 'results in'.\n\nWe are asked to infer the reverse implication: If not B (the truck is not metal), then not A (the doll is not plastic). This would be represented as not B \u2192 not A.\n\nTo establish this inference, we need to ensure that the original statement is a true conditional and that the antecedent (A) and consequent (B) are logically consistent with each other. If the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. However, the reverse does not necessarily hold; just because the truck is metal does not mean that the doll has to be plastic. There could be other reasons for the truck being metal that do not involve the doll's material.",
