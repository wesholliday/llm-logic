This means that if A is true, then B must also be true.\n\nHowever, the proposed inference is another conditional statement, this time C \u2192 D, where C is 'Chris did not finish the race' and D is 'Alex did not finish the race.' We need to determine whether, given A \u2192 B, we can conclude that C \u2192 D.\n\nIntuitively, it seems like the inference might be true because if Chris not finishing the race (C) implies that Alex also did not finish the race (D), then the reverse would also seem to be true: If Alex finished the race (A), then Chris must have finished the race as well (B).\n\nHowever, this intuition is not always correct in logic.
