The contrapositive of an implication is obtained by flipping both parts of the conditional and then negating them. So, the contrapositive of \"Joe going to the park \u2192 Lucy going to the zoo\" is:\n\nLucy not going to the zoo \u2192 Joe not going to the park\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement (i.e., they have the same truth value), we can infer that if Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>",
