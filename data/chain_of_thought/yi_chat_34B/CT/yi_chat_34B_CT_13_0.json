            "content": "[SYS]To determine whether we can infer 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red' from 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue', let's consider the logical implications of both statements.\n\nThe original statement is an \"if-then\" proposition:\n1. If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n\nFor this to be true, there are two possibilities:\nA. The car is red, and the truck is blue (which satisfies the condition).\nB. The car is not red (which negates the condition).\n\nIn either case, we cannot conclude that the truck must be blue if the car is not red. The original statement only tells us that when the car is red, the truck is blue; it does not specify what happens when the car is not red.\n\nNow let's consider the proposed inference:\n2. If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\n\nThis would imply a reverse causality or dependency that is not stated in the original proposition. The truth of the truck's color does not necessarily determine the truth of the car's color based on the information given.",
