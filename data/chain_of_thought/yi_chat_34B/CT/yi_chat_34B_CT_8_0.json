            "content": "[SYS]To determine whether we can infer 'If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake' from the statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake', let's consider the logical implications of the given statement.\n\nThe original statement is in the form of a conditional: If A (the vampire being awake), then B (the mummy being awake). In this context, A is called the antecedent, and B is the consequent. The truth value of the entire conditional depends on whether both A and B are true or not.\n\nNow, we want to infer a new statement: If not B (the mummy was not awake), then not A (the vampire was not awake). This new statement is also in the form of a conditional with the negation of B as the antecedent and the negation of A as the consequent.\n\nAccording to classical logic, an implication (if-then statement) is false only when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. In all other cases, it is considered true. So, if we can guarantee that whenever B is not true, A must also not",
