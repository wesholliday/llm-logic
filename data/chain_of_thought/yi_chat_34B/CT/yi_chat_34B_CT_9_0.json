            "content": "[RESP]Let's analyze the statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement of the form A \u2192 B, where A is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and B is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of this statement would be not B \u2192 not A. In other words, if we negate both parts of the original condition (Lisa did not buy the red shirt or Mark did not buy the blue shirt), we get the contrapositive.\n\nNow, let's consider the proposed statement: \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" This is indeed the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nAccording to the law of contraposition in logic, if a conditional statement is true, its contrapositive is also true. Therefore, given that the original statement (Lisa buying the red shirt implies Mark buying the blue shirt) is true, we can infer that the proposed statement (Mark not buying the blue shirt implies Lisa not buying the red shirt) is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
