            "content": "[SYS]To determine whether we can infer 'If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball' from the statement 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis', let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is in the form of a conditional (if-then) statement: If A, then B. This can be represented as A \u2192 B, where A is 'Jeff played basketball' and B is 'Amy played tennis'.\n\n2. We are asked to infer a new statement: If not B, then not A. This would be represented as \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA.\n\n3. To make this inference, we need to apply the contrapositive rule, which states that for any conditional statement A \u2192 B, its contrapositive (\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA) is logically equivalent. In other words, if the original statement is true, so is its contrapositive.\n\n4. The contrapositive of a conditional statement can be found by flipping both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then negating them. So for 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis' (A \u2192 B), the contrapositive would be 'If Amy did",
