This can be represented as A \u2192 B in symbolic logic. The proposed inference is also in the form of a conditional: If not B, then not A.\n\nAccording to the law of contraposition in classical logic, if we have a conditional statement A \u2192 B, it is logically equivalent to the contrapositive statement not B \u2192 not A. This means that if we can infer 'If the cat was outside' from 'The dog was inside', then we can also infer 'If the dog was not inside' from 'The cat was not outside'.\n\nHowever, the original statement does not directly tell us what happens when the dog is not inside or when the cat is not outside. It only establishes a relationship between the presence of the dog and the absence of the cat (or vice versa) under certain conditions.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided by the original statement alone, we",
