This means that if A is true, then B must also be true.\n\nHowever, the proposed inference flips the condition and the consequence, creating a new proposition: \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA. This would mean that if B (the banana being yellow) is not true, then A (the apple being red) must also not be true.\n\nThe problem with this inference is that it assumes a direct causal relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana, which may not necessarily exist in reality. The original statement only tells us that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow; it does not provide any information about what happens when the banana is not yellow or the apple is not red.\n\nIn a strict logical sense, we cannot",
