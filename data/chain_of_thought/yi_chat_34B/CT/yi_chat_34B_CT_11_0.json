The contrapositive of A \u2192 B is ~B \u2192 ~A.\n\nSince the proposed inference is essentially the same as the contrapositive of the original statement, we can infer that \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\"<|im_end|>\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Explanation: The original statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is a conditional statement that can be represented as A \u2192 B, where A is",
