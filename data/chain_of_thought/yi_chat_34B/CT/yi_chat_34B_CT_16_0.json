            "content": "[SYS]To determine whether we can infer 'If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton' from the statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim', let's consider the logical implications step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is in the form of a conditional (if-then) statement: If A (the shirt is cotton), then B (the pants are denim).\n\n2. We want to infer a new statement that is the contrapositive of the original: If not B (the pants are not denim), then not A (the shirt is not cotton).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if one side of the conditional is false, so is the other.\n\n4. Therefore, we can infer 'If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton' from the original statement because they are logically equivalent in their truth values.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Yes<|im_end|>\n",
