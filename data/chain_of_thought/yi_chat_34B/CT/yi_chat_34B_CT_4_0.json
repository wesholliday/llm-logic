The original statement is in the form of a conditional (if-then) statement: If A (alien visited Mars), then B (robot visited Jupiter).\n\n2. We are asked to infer a new statement in the same form but with the conditions reversed: If not B (robot did not visit Jupiter), then not A (alien did not visit Mars).\n\n3. To make this inference, we would need to apply the contrapositive rule, which states that if a conditional statement is true, its contrapositive (the negation of both the hypothesis and conclusion) is also true. The contrapositive of 'If A then B' is 'If not B then not A'.\n\n4. However, in this case, we are not given the original statement in a form that allows us to directly apply the contrapositive rule. We need to know whether the original conditional statement 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited",
