The original statement is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"if P, then Q,\" where P represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. We are asked to infer whether \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\" is true. This can be represented as \"if not Q, then not P.\"\n\n3. To make this inference, we would need to know that the original conditional statement is true and also that its contrapositive (which is logically equivalent) is true. The contrapositive of \"if P, then Q\" is \"if not Q, then not P.\"\n\n4. However, without additional information about the truth values of P and Q, we cannot determine the truth value of the contrapositive. We only know that if P is true, then Q must be true (because the original statement says so). But we do not know what happens when Q is false\u2014we don't know whether P",
