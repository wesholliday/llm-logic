The original statement is \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where 'P' represents \"the griffin was in the forest\" and 'Q' represents \"the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\n2. The proposed inference is \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\" This can be represented as \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\n3. To determine if this inference is valid, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. In classical logic, an implication (if-then statement) is considered true unless the antecedent (the part before 'then') is true and the consequent (the part after 'then') is false.\n\n4. The proposed inference flips the original conditional by taking the negation of both P and Q. However, simply taking the negation of a conditional does not necessarily create a logically equivalent statement unless the original conditional was a",
