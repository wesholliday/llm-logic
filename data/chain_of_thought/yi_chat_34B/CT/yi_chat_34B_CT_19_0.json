            "content": "[SYS]To determine whether we can infer 'If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football' from the statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball', let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is an \"if-then\" proposition, which means it follows a logical structure where one event (Tom watching football) is said to be a necessary condition for another event (Jen watching basketball). This can be represented as:\n   If Tom watches football, then Jen must watch basketball.\n\n2. The statement does not provide any information about what happens if Tom *doesn't* watch football. It only tells us that if he does watch it, then Jen will also watch basketball.\n\n3. To infer 'If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football' from the given statement, we would need to know that when Jen doesn't watch basketball, it is because Tom didn't watch football. However, the original statement does not provide this information. It only establishes a relationship in one direction: if Tom watches football, then Jen watches basketball.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the information provided by the original statement",
