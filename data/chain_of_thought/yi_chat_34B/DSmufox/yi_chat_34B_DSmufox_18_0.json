It could be nugged, but it is not a requirement.\n\n2. \"Either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked.\" This is a logical disjunction, meaning that one of two conditions must be true: either the shank is nugged, or it is plooked. Since we already know from statement 1 that the shank does not have to be nugged, this means that if it's not nugged, it must be plooked.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Yes<|im_end|>\n",
