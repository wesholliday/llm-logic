In this case, the sneg being sproted or the sneg being crampled are the options.\n\nGiven that we know the sneg does not have to be sproted (from statement 1), and considering the disjunction in statement 2, we can conclude that if the sneg is not sproted (which is allowed by statement 1), then it must be crampled, because those are the only two options given in statement 2.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response. Thank you for your question. If you have any further questions or need assistance with anything else, please let me know!<|im_end|>\n[END]",
