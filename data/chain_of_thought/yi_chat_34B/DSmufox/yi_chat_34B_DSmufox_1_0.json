In this case, the proposition is \"The flugel is zargled.\"\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer the following:\n\n- If the flugel were to be zargled, then the second statement would be true because one of its options (the flugel being zargled) would be satisfied. However, according to the first statement, this is not the case (it's not a necessary condition).\n\n- Since the flugel does not have to be zargled and it cannot be both zargled and blimmed at the same time (because \"either",
