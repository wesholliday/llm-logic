In this case, the sprocket is either daggled or cranked (or both, but since we're dealing with logic and not physical reality, we can assume it's one or the other).\n\n3. Since we know from statement 1 that the sprocket does not have to be daggled, and given the excluded middle principle in statement 2, we can conclude that if it is not daggled, then it must be cranked.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that \"The sprocket is cranked.\"<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Yes<|im_end|><|im_end|>",
