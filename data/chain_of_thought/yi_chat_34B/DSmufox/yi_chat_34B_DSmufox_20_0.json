In this case, the proposition is \"The fleeg must be surned.\" So, if it's not a necessary condition (as per statement 1), then the only other option is that it is bluttered.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can infer:\n\n3. \"The fleeg is bluttered.\" This is the logical conclusion because if the fleeg does not have to be surned and it's either surned or bluttered (and it's not surned), then by default, it must be bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n",
