In other words, the glip can exist without being tragged.\n\n2. \"Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged.\" This is an example of the logical principle of the excluded middle, which states that for any proposition, either it is true or its negation is true. In this case, the proposition is \"The glip is tragged.\" So, according to this principle, we have two possibilities:\n   - The glip is tragged.\n   - It is not the case that the glip is tragged (which means the glip is slogged).\n\nNow, given that we know \"It's not the case that the glip must be tragged,\" this rules out the first possibility because we already have a statement asserting that the glip does not need to be tragged. Therefore, the only remaining option is:\n\n- The glip is slogged.\n\nBased",
