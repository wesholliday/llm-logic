'It's not the case that the splat must be quanked' implies that being quanked is not a necessary condition for the splat. In other words, it is possible for the splat to exist without being quanked.\n\n2. 'Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed' is a disjunction, meaning that one of two conditions must be true: either the splat is quanked, or it is morphed. Since we already know from statement 1 that being quanked is not necessary, this means that if the splat exists and is not quanked, then it must be morphed.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer 'The splat is morphed' only if we also know that the splat exists and is not quanked. However, we do not have information about whether the splat actually exists or what its state is. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively conclude that 'The splat is morphed'.\n",
