Since we already know from the first statement that the dreb does not have to be spent, this means that the only remaining option is that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can indeed infer that \"The dreb is vroombed.\" This is because if it's not mandatory for the dreb to be spent, and it must either be spent or vroombed, then by process of elimination, the dreb must be vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
