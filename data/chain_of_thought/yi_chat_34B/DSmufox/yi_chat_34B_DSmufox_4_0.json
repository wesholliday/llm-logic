In this case, the fribble is either crinked or snurgled.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer the following:\n\n- If the fribble is not crinked (which is allowed by statement 1), then it must be snurgled according to statement 2.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can conclude that 'The fribble is snurgled'.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Yes<|im_end|><|im_end|>\n",
