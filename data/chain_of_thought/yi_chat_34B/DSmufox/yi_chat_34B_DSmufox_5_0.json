In other words, the zinger can exist without being smoogled.\n\n2. \"Either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled.\" This is an example of the logical principle of the excluded middle, which states that a proposition is either true or false. In this case, the zinger must be either smoogled or fraggled. Since we already know from statement 1 that it's not necessarily smoogled, then by default, it must be fraggled.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can infer:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Yes<|im_end|>\n",
