It implies that there are situations where the flob can exist without being movated.\n\n2. \"Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled.\" This is an example of a disjunctive statement, which means that one of two things must be true: either the flob is movated or it is skizzled. There are no other options given in this statement.\n\nNow, since we know from the first statement that the flob does not have to be movated, and the second statement tells us that if it's not movated, then it must be skizzled, we can infer:\n\n3. \"The flob is skizzled.\" This is because, according to the second statement, if the flob is not movated (which we know from the first statement is a possibility), then it must be skizz",
