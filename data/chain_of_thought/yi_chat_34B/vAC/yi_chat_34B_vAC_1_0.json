            "content": "\n[THINK]To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure and see if it follows a valid logical pattern. The argument has two premises (if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding; and Sue was at the wedding) and a conclusion (Mary was at the wedding).\n\nThe first premise is an \"if-then\" statement, which in classical logic can be interpreted as a material conditional. A material conditional has the form \"If P, then Q\" where P is the antecedent and Q is the consequent. The truth table for a material conditional shows that if the consequent (Q) is true, the whole statement is true regardless of the truth value of the antecedent (P).\n\nThe second premise states that Sue was at the wedding, which corresponds to the consequent in the first premise. Since the second premise is true, according to the truth table for a material conditional, the first premise must also be considered true for the argument to be valid. This means that if we assume the second premise (Sue was at the wedding) to be true, then the conclusion (Mary was at the wedding) must follow necessarily from the first premise",
