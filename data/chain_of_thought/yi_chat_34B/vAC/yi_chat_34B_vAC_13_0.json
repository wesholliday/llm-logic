The second premise confirms that the truck was blue.\n3. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n4. In a logically valid argument, if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n5. Since the first premise is a conditional statement (if A then B) and the second premise confirms B (the truck was blue), we can infer that A (the car was red) must be true as well, according to the condition set by the first premise.\n6. Therefore, given the truth of both premises, the conclusion logically follows.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
