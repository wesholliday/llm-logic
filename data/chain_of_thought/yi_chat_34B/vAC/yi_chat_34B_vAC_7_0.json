This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where P represents 'Alex finished the race' and Q represents 'Chris finished the race'.\n\n2. The second premise asserts that 'Chris finished the race' is true. This is a claim about the truth value of one of the potential outcomes of the conditional statement in the first premise.\n\n3. The conclusion states that Alex finished the race. This is claiming that the antecedent (Alex finishing the race) is true, based on the second premise which asserts the consequent (Chris finishing the race) as true and the first premise which establishes a relationship between them.\n\n4. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the truth of the second premise (Chris finished the race) guarantees the truth of the conclusion (Alex finished the race) given the relationship described in the first premise.\n\n5. In this case, the first premise does not guarantee that if Chris finished the race, Alex must have finished it as well. It could be that Alex did not finish the race, but",
