This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n2. The second premise states that the mummy was awake. This provides us with information about one part of the conditional statement (B) being true.\n3. To determine whether the conclusion 'The vampire was awake' follows logically from the premises, we need to consider the truth value of A in light of B being true.\n4. If the first premise is true, then when B (the mummy being awake) is true, it must also be the case that A (the vampire being awake) is true.\n5. Therefore, given that the second premise (B) is true and the first premise establishes a relationship between A and B, the conclusion 'The vampire was awake' (A) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
