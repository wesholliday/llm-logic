The second premise confirms that Kate did indeed eat salad.\n3. The conclusion asserts that Ben ate pasta.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. In other words, does following the rules of logic ensure that if the first two statements are true, the third statement must also be true?\n\nIn this case, the first premise is a conditional statement, which in classical logic is considered valid (true) only when both P and Q are true. If Ben ate pasta (P is true) and Kate ate salad (Q is true), then the conditional \"If P, then Q\" is true. However, the second premise alone does not guarantee that Ben ate pasta; it only tells us that if he did eat pasta, then Kate eating salad would be a consequence.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot logically conclude that because Kate ate salad (which is a necessary condition for Ben's having eaten pasta), Ben must",
