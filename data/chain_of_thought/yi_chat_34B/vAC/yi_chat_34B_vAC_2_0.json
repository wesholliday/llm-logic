This is a conditional statement where 'griffin in the forest' is the antecedent and 'unicorn in the forest' is the consequent.\n\n2. The second premise tells us that the unicorn was indeed in the forest.\n\n3. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. The conclusion states that the griffin was in the forest.\n\n4. Since the first premise is a conditional statement and the second premise provides us with the truth of the consequent (unicorn in the forest), we can infer the truth of the antecedent (griffin in the forest) according to the rule of material implication in classical logic.\n\n5. Therefore, given that the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
