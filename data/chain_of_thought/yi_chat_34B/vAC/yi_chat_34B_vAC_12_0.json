If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. (Premise 1)\n2. Lucy went to the zoo. (Premise 2)\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n3. Joe went to the park. (Conclusion)\n\nWe can represent this argument using a truth table to check its validity. A truth table shows all possible combinations of true and false values for each proposition in an argument. If, after constructing the truth table, we find that the conclusion is true for every combination of premises that are true, then the argument is valid.\n\nHowever, before constructing the truth table, let's consider the structure of the argument. The first premise is an if-then statement, which means it follows the logical form of a conditional: If A, then B. This can be represented as A \u2192 B, where '\u2192' is the arrow symbol used to denote a conditional relationship.\n\nThe second premise states that Lucy went to the zoo, which we can represent as L. The conclusion states that Joe",
