This can be represented as an implication: If A (James wrote the book), then B (the book is a mystery novel).\n\n2. The second premise directly asserts that the book is a mystery novel (B).\n\n3. The conclusion states that the book was written by James (A).\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to ask ourselves if it is possible for both premises to be true and the conclusion false. If so, then the argument is not valid.\n\nExplanation:\n\nGiven the first premise as an implication (If A, then B) and the second premise asserting B, we can conclude that A must also be true according to the law of excluded middle for implications. This means that if the antecedent (A) is false, then the entire implication is false, but since the consequent (B) is true, the implication must be true, and thus A cannot be false. Therefore, when B is true, we can infer that A is also true.\n\nSince it is",
