This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n3. The second premise states that the pants were denim. This provides evidence for the truth of one part of the conditional statement (B).\n4. The conclusion states that the shirt was cotton. This is claiming that because the pants are denim and if the shirt being cotton would mean the pants are denim, then the shirt must be cotton.\n5. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the truth of the second premise (the pants were denim) guarantees the truth of the conclusion (the shirt was cotton), given the first premise (if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim).\n6. In this case, the truth of the second premise does not necessarily guarantee the truth of the conclusion because it is possible that the shirt could be something other than cotton and still satisfy the condition of the first premise. For example, if the shirt was polyester but the pants were indeed denim, then the argument would be invalid because the conclusion",
