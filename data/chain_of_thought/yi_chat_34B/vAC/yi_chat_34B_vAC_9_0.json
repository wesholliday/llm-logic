The argument appears to be in the form of a syllogism with two premises and a conclusion. Let's break down each premise and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. (This is an \"if-then\" statement where \"Lisa buying the red shirt\" is the antecedent and \"Mark buying the blue shirt\" is the consequent.)\n2. Premise 2: Mark bought the blue shirt. (This directly confirms the consequent of Premise 1.)\n3. Conclusion: Lisa bought the red shirt. (This asserts the antecedent of Premise 1.)\n\nThe logical structure of an \"if-then\" statement is such that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true. However, the converse is not necessarily true; if the consequent is true, it does not automatically mean that the antecedent is also true.\n\nIn this argument, we have the second premise confirming the",
