If A, then B (Premise 1)\n2. B (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, A (Conclusion)\n\nHere, 'A' represents 'the bear was in the cave' and 'B' represents 'the wolf was in the den'.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B', which can be symbolized as 'A \u2192 B'. The second premise states that 'B' (the consequent) is true. According to the rules of deductive logic, if the antecedent ('A') does not logically imply the negation of the consequent ('\u00acB'), then the conditional statement 'A \u2192 B' is considered valid.\n\nIn this case, since we are given that 'B' (the wolf was in the den) is true, and the first premise states that if 'A' (the bear was in the cave) were true, then 'B' would be true, we can conclude that",
