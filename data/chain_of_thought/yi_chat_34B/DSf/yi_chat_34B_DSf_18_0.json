The statement \"Either the notebook is sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer\" tells us that there are only two possible locations for the notebook: on the nightstand or in the drawer.\n2. We are given the additional information that \"The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand.\" This eliminates one of the two possibilities mentioned in the first statement.\n3. Since we have already established that the notebook is not where it could be (on the nightstand), according to the original statement, it must be in the other location mentioned, which is the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
