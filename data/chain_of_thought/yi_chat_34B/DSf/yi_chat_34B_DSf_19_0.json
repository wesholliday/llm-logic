The statement \"Either the watch is on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser\" tells us that there are only two possible locations for the watch: on the person's wrist or on the dresser, where it is charging.\n2. We are given the additional information that \"The watch isn't on his wrist.\" This means one of the possibilities has been eliminated, leaving only the other option.\n3. Since there are no other options mentioned, and both statements must be true, we can infer that if the watch is not on the person's wrist, it must be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
