The statement \"Either the milk is chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter\" tells us that there are only two possibilities for where the milk can be: in the fridge or on the counter.\n2. We are given the additional information that \"The milk isn't chilling in the fridge,\" which means one of the two possibilities has been eliminated.\n3. Since there are only two options left and we have confirmed that one of them (the milk being in the fridge) is not true, then by default, the other option must be true.\n4. Therefore, if the milk is not chilling in the fridge, it must be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
