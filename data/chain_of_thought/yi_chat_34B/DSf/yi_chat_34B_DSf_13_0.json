The statement \"Either the toy is sitting on the shelf or it is in the toy box\" tells us that there are only two possible locations for the toy: on the shelf or in the toy box.\n2. We are given the additional information that \"The toy isn't sitting on the shelf.\" This eliminates one of the two possibilities mentioned in the first statement.\n3. Since the toy is not on the shelf and there are only two options, we can conclude that the toy must be in the toy box, as this is the only remaining option given by the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
