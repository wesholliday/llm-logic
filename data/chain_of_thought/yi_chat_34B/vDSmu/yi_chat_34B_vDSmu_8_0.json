This is a disjunction, meaning that one of two things must be true.\n\n2. The second premise negates the possibility that the remote control must be hiding under the couch. Since we are told that only one of the options can be true (the law of excluded middle), if we eliminate the possibility of it being under the couch, then by default, the remote control must be on the coffee table.\n\n3. The conclusion states that the remote control is on the coffee table. This follows directly from the second premise, which rules out the only other option presented in the first premise.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the form of argument appears to be logically valid because the conclusion is a necessary consequence of the premises provided.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
