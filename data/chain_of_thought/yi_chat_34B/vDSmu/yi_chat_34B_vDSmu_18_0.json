This creates two possibilities for the location of the notebook.\n2. The second premise negates the possibility that the notebook is on the nightstand, leaving only one option standing: the notebook must be in the drawer.\n3. Since the conclusion states that the notebook is in the drawer, and our reasoning has eliminated all other options, the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1. The first premise establishes a logical OR between two possibilities: the notebook is in the drawer or on the nightstand.\n2. The second premise negates the possibility that the notebook is on the nightstand with a logical NOT, effectively removing that option from consideration.\n3.
