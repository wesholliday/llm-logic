Since we already know that the fribble was crinked (from the first statement), this means that the condition for the fribble being snurgled is met.\n\n- However, the second statement only tells us that if the fribble were snurgled, it would be crinked. It does not guarantee that the fribble actually was snurgled; it only establishes a necessary relationship between",
