The first statement tells us that the splat was quanked, and the second statement tells us that if the splat were morphed, it would be quanked. Since we know the splat was quanked, we can look at the conditional statement to see if it provides any additional insight.\n\nThe conditional statement suggests that if the splat were morphed, it would lead to the splat being quanked. However, it does not guarantee that the only way for the splat to be quanked is for it to be morphed. The conditional statement does not provide enough information to",
