It suggests that if the splat underwent a transformation (being \"morphed\"), then it would result in the splat performing the action of \"quanking.\" However, this does not necessarily mean that the splat was morphed; it only establishes a relationship between being morphed and quanking.\n\nGiven these two statements alone, we cannot definitively infer that \"The splat was morphed.\" The first statement tells us that the splat quanked, but it does not provide any information about whether it was morphed or not. The second statement tells us what would happen if the splat were morphed, but it does not confirm that the splat actually underwent this transformation.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that \"The splat was morp",
