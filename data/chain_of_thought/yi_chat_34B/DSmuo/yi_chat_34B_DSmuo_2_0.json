It introduces a possibility that the book is not on the table.\n\n2. \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\" This is an example of a disjunction, which means that one of two things must be true: either the book is on the shelf, or it is resting on the table. Since we already know from statement 1 that it's not necessarily on the table, the only remaining option is that it must be on the shelf.\n\nGiven these two statements together, we can indeed infer 'The book is on the shelf.' The first statement rules out the possibility of the book being on the table (which is one of the options in the disjunction), and since both options cannot be false simultaneously, the only remaining option must be true.\n\n",
