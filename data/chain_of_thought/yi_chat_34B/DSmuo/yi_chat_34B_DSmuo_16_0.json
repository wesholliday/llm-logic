This means that the absence of the pen from my desk does not lead to a logical contradiction.\n\n2. \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk\" states that the pen is either in my bag or on my desk, but not both (since \"or\" is used in the exclusive sense). This means that if the pen is not on my desk, it must be in my bag.\n\nGiven these two statements together:\n\n- If the pen were on my desk, then the first statement would be true, and the second statement would also be true (because the pen being on the desk satisfies both possibilities).\n- However, since we know that \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk,\" the pen cannot be on my desk.\n\nTherefore, because the pen is not on my desk and one of the two possibilities given in the second statement must be true",
