We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen.\" (Statement 1)\n   - \"Either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen.\" (Statement 2)\n\n2. Statement 1 tells us that the phone does not have to be ringing in the kitchen. This means that there are other possibilities for where the sound could be coming from, or the phone could be silent.\n\n3. Statement 2 gives us two options: The phone is either in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen. Since we already know from Statement 1 that it's not necessarily ringing in the kitchen, the only other option left is that the phone is in the living room.\n\n4. Therefore, based on both statements together, we can infer 'The phone is in the living room.'<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
