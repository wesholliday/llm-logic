We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n   - \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\n2. The first statement implies that the toy does not have to be on the bookshelf, which means there are other possibilities for its location.\n\n3. The second statement presents a logical OR condition: the toy is either in the toy box or on the bookshelf. Since we already know it's not on the bookshelf (from the first statement), the only remaining possibility is that it must be in the toy box.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that \"The toy is in the toy box.\"<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
