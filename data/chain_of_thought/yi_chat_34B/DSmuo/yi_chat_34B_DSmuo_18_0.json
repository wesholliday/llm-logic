We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n   - \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n\n2. The first statement implies that the notebook does not have to be on the nightstand, which means there are other possibilities for its location.\n\n3. The second statement presents a logical OR condition: the notebook is either in the drawer or it must be on the nightstand (but since we already know from the first statement that it doesn't have to be on the nightstand, this part of the second statement is effectively nullified).\n\n4. Since the possibility of the notebook being on the nightstand is not required by the first statement and is therefore not a necessary condition, the only remaining option is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
