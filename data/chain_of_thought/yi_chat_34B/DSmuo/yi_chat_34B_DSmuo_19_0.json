The statement \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist\" implies that there are other possible locations for the watch besides being on his wrist.\n2. The statement \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist\" presents two options: the watch is either on the dresser or on his wrist.\n3. Since we have established that the watch does not have to be on his wrist, and there are only two options given, the watch must be in one of those locations.\n4. Therefore, if it's not on his wrist, then by process of elimination, the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
