The statement \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\" implies that there are other possibilities for where the jacket could be besides being hung in the closet.\n2. The statement \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" presents two options: the jacket is either draped over the chair or it is hanging in the closet.\n3. Since we know from point 1 that the jacket does not have to be hanging in the closet, and given the two options presented in point 2, the only remaining option is that the jacket must be draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
