We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\"\n   - \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack.\"\n\n2. The first statement (A) tells us that the scarf does not have to be draped on the coat rack, which means it can be somewhere else.\n\n3. The second statement (B) presents a logical OR condition: the scarf is either in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack. Since we know from A that it doesn't have to be on the coat rack, B implies that the scarf must be stuffed in my backpack.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that 'The scarf is stuffed in my backpack' (C).\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
