We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" (Statement A).\n   - \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" (Statement B).\n\n2. Statement A tells us that the milk does not have to be chilling in the fridge, which means it could be somewhere else or not refrigerated at all.\n\n3. Statement B presents a logical OR condition: The milk is either on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge. Since we know from Statement A that it doesn't have to be chilling in the fridge, the only other option left is that it is on the counter.\n\n4. Therefore, based on Statements A and B, we can infer that 'The milk is on the counter'.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
