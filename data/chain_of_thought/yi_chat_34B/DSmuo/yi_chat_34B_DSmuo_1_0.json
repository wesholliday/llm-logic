We are given two premises:\n   - Premise 1: It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n   - Premise 2: Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\n\n2. Premise 1 tells us that Fido is not required to be in the garden, which means it is possible for him to be elsewhere.\n3. Premise 2 presents a logical disjunction, where 'Either' indicates that one of two alternatives must be true. In this case, either Fido is inside or he must be in the garden (but not both).\n4. Since we know from Premise 1 that Fido does not have to be in the garden, the only remaining option consistent with both premises is for Fido to be inside.\n5. Therefore, we can infer 'Fido is inside' based on the given information.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n",
