It does not specify which of these two possibilities is true, only that one of them must be the case.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that since the puzzle piece cannot be both in the box and blending in on the floor (because that would contradict the first statement), and it must be one or the other (according to the second statement), then it must be true that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Yes<|im_end|>\n",
