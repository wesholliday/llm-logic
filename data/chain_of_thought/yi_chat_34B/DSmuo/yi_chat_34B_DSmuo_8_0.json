The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" implies that there are other possible locations for the remote control besides under the couch.\n2. The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two options: the remote control is on the coffee table, or it is hiding under the couch.\n3. Since we have already established that the remote control does not have to be under the couch, the only other option left is that it is on the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, based on these two statements, we can infer 'The remote control is on the coffee table'.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
