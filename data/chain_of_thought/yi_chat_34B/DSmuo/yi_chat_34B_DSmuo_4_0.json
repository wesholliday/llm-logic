This leaves open the possibility that the cat could be doing something else, such as napping on the couch.\n\n2. The statement \"Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom\" presents two alternatives: the cat is either napping on the couch or it is playing in the bedroom. Since we already know from the first statement that it's not playing in the bedroom, this eliminates one of the options.\n\n3. With the option to play in the bedroom eliminated, the only remaining possibility is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
