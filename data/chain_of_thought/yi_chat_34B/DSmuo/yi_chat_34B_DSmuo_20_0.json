We are given two statements:\n   - \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n   - \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\"\n\n2. The first statement tells us that the sunglasses do not have to be perched on her head, which means it is possible for them to be somewhere else.\n\n3. The second statement presents a logical disjunction: either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head. Since we already know from the first statement that they don't have to be perched on her head, this means that the only other option is that they are in her bag.\n\n4. Therefore, based on these two statements together, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
