In other words, if Sue didn't choose pizza, we cannot conclude anything about whether Bob chose pasta based on the original conditional statement alone.\n\nTherefore, from the information given, we cannot infer with certainty that \"Bob did not choose pasta\" because the original conditional does not provide a clear rule for what to do when P (Sue choosing pizza) is false.<|im_end|>\n[ANSWER]Answer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[THINK]To determine whether we can infer that Bob did not choose pasta from the given information, let's break down the statements and analyze",
