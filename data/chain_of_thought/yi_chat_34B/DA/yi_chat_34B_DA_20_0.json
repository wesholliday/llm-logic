            "content": "[RESP]Let's analyze this statement step by step:\n\n1. The given information is that \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This is a conditional statement where being red (the condition) implies that the banana is yellow (the consequence).\n\n2. We are also told that \"The apple was not red.\" This means that the condition for the original statement to be true (apple being red) does not hold.\n\n3. Since the condition did not occur, we cannot conclude anything about the consequence. In other words, just because the apple wasn't red doesn't mean that the banana isn't yellow; it could still be yellow or a different color for all we know.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer whether the banana was not yellow. The original statement only tells us what would happen if the condition (apple being red) were true, but since that condition is not met, we have no way to determine the status of the consequence (banana's color).\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END",
