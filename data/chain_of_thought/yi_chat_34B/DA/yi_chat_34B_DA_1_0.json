            "content": "[THINK]To determine whether we can infer that Sue was not at the wedding, let's break down the information given:\n\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is an implication. It means that if the first part (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true. This does not necessarily mean that if Mary is not at the wedding, Sue will not be there as well; it only establishes a relationship in one direction.\n\n2. We are told \"Mary was not at the wedding\". This is a fact that contradicts the first statement's condition (Mary being at the wedding). Since the condition is not met, we cannot automatically conclude anything about Sue's presence based on this information alone.\n\nBased on these two pieces of information, we cannot directly infer whether or not Sue was at the wedding. The original implication only tells us that if Mary were present, then Sue would be too; it does not provide a reverse implication that if Mary is absent, Sue must also be absent. Therefore, without additional information about Sue's attendance, we cannot make a definitive conclusion about Sue's",
