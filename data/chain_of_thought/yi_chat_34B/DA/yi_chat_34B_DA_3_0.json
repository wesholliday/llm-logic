The book was not written by James (Premise 2).\n\nWe are asked to determine if we can infer 'The book is not a mystery novel' from these premises.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the logical implications of Premise 1 and Premise 2. Premise 1 establishes a conditional relationship: If James wrote the book, then it must be a mystery novel. However, Premise 2 tells us that James did not write the book. Since the condition (James writing the book) is not met, we cannot directly conclude anything about the book being a mystery novel based on Premise 1 alone.\n\nTherefore, given only Premises 1 and 2, we cannot logically infer 'The book is not a mystery novel' because there is no direct link between James not writing the book and the book's genre. We would need additional information about the book's genre or some other relevant fact to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END",
