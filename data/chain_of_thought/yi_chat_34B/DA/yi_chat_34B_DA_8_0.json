Since the antecedent (A) of the conditional statement is false (the vampire was not awake), we cannot apply the conditional to conclude anything about B (whether the mummy was awake or not).\n\nIn other words, because A is false, A \u2192 B does not provide us with any information about B. We can only say that the condition for B to be true (A) is not met, but we cannot determine the truth value of B itself.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RE",
