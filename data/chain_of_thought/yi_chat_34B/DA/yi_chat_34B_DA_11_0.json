This does not guarantee the truth of either statement on its own; it only establishes a relationship between them.\n- Premise 2 tells us that the first part of the implication in Premise 1 is false (the cake is not chocolate).\n\nNow, if we apply the logic of an implication to these premises:\n\n- If the antecedent (the cake being chocolate) is false, as per Premise 2, then the truth value of the consequent (the muffins being blueberry) is irrelevant; the implication does not tell us anything about the",
