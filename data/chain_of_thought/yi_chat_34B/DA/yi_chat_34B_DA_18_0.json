If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. (Premise 1)\n2. The doll was not plastic. (Premise 2)\n\nFrom Premise 2, we know that the doll is not plastic. Since Premise 1 states a conditional relationship ('if P, then Q'), we can use the contrapositive rule to infer something about the truck when we know the doll is not plastic. The contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nApplying the contrapositive to Premise 1:\n- If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic. (Contrapositive of Premise 1)\n\nNow we have:\n3. The doll was not plastic. (Premise 2)\n4. If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.
