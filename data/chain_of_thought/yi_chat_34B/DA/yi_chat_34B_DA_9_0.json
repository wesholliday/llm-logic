            "content": "[RESP]Let's think step by step:\n\n1. The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q.\" In this case, P = \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q = \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. We are also given that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" This means that the condition P (Lisa buying the red shirt) is false.\n\n3. In a conditional statement, if the antecedent (the part before 'then') is false, then the entire statement is considered true regardless of the truth value of the consequent (the part after 'then'). This is because if the condition for something to happen never occurs, we cannot say that the thing would or would not have happened in that case.\n\n4. Therefore, since P is false, we cannot conclude anything about Q (Mark buying the blue shirt) based on the conditional statement alone. The truth of the consequent Q remains unknown and undetermined by the given information.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n",
