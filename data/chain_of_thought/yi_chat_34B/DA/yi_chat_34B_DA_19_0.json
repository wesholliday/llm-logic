The second statement, \"Tom did not watch football,\" provides us with additional information that negates the condition in the first statement. This means that the entire conditional statement is false because the antecedent (Tom watching football) is false.\n\n3. Since the conditional statement is false, we cannot infer anything about Jen's actions based on Tom's non-action. The truth value of Jen's action (watching basketball) is not determined by the negation of Tom's action alone.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot logically infer that Jen did not watch basketball.<|im_end|>\n[ANSWER]Answer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[THINK]To determine whether we can infer that Jen did not watch basketball from the given information, let's break down the statements and analyze them logically.\n\n1. \"If Tom",
