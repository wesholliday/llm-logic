It means that if the condition (the car being red) is true, then the consequence (the truck being blue) must also be true. However, it does not specify what happens to the consequence when the condition is not met.\n\n2. \"The car was not red\" directly contradicts the condition in the first statement. Since the condition is not met, we cannot automatically conclude anything about the consequence (the truck's color) based solely on the first statement.\n\nTherefore, from the information provided, we cannot logically infer that the truck was not blue. The second statement only tells us that the car was not red, which does not necessarily mean that the truck was not blue. There could be other scenarios where the car is not red and the truck is still blue.<|im_end|>\n[ANSWER]Answer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[THINK]To determine whether we can infer that the truck was not blue from the given information, let's",
