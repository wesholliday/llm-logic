This means that if the first part (the antecedent) is true, then the second part (the consequent) must also be true. However, if the antecedent is false, it does not necessarily mean that the consequent is false as well.\n\n2. We are given \"The griffin was not in the forest\" which means that the antecedent of the implication is false.\n\n3. Since the antecedent (\"The griffin was in the forest\") is false, we cannot directly infer anything about the consequent (\"The unicorn was in the forest\") based on the truth value of the antecedent alone.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot logically infer that \"The unicorn was not in the forest.\" The best we can say is that we do not have enough information to determine the location of the unicorn with respect to the forest.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: no<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n",
