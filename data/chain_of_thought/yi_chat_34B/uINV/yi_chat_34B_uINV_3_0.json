This is because there are only two options: either the book is written by James and thus must be a mystery novel, or the book is not written by James, in which case it cannot be a mystery novel (since all books by James are mysteries).\n\nTherefore, based on the initial statement that every book by James is a mystery novel, we can infer that if the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Explanation: The initial statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book",
