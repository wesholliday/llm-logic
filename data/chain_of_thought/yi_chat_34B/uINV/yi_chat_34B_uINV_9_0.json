The logical form is: If not A, then not B. In this case, A would be 'Lisa buying the red shirt' and B would be 'Mark buying the blue shirt'. So the contrapositive would be: \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\n\nHowever, when dealing with conditionals, we often rely on the transitive property, which states that if A implies B and B implies C, then A implies C. In this context, it means that if 'Lisa buying the",
