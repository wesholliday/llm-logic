However, the reverse implication is not necessarily true; just because Bob chose pasta does not mean that Sue chose pizza (there could be other reasons why Bob chose pasta).\n\nNow, let's consider the contrapositive of the original statement:\n\nNot (Sue choosing pizza) \u2192 Not (Bob choosing pasta)\n\nThe contrapositive",
