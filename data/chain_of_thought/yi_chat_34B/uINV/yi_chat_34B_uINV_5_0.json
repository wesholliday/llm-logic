Since we know that the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nTherefore, if we can show that Amy did not play tennis, then by the law of contraposition, we can conclude that Jeff did not play basketball. However, the question asks us to infer whether if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.
