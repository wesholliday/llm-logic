This can be represented as (\u00acB) \u2192 (\u00acA).\n\nNow, we are asked to infer whether if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding. This is equivalent to asking if (\u00acA) \u2192 (\u00acB) is true.\n\nAccording to the law of contrapositive, a conditional statement A \u2192 B is logically equivalent to its contrapositive (\u00acB) \u2192 (\u00acA). Since we know that Mary being at the wedding implies that Sue is also there, and vice versa, we can conclude that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue must also not have been at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"yes\" because the contrapositive of the original",
