This is because if you negate the hypothesis and conclusion separately and then flip them, you are essentially saying that wherever the first part (griffin) is not present, the second part (unicorn) is also not present.\n\nTherefore, based on the logic of contrapositives, we can infer that \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\"<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement",
