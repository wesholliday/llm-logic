            "content": "[RESP]Let's consider the statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement where watching football (Tom) is the condition for Jen to watch basketball.\n\nNow, let's analyze the contrapositive of this statement, which is \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\" The contrapositive maintains the same truth value as the original statement.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that the contrapositive is true, we need to consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. If Tom watched football, then by the given condition, Jen must have watched basketball.\n2. If Tom did not watch football, there are two possibilities: a) Jen still watched basketball, or b) Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with a conditional statement where the truth of the second part (Jen watching basketball) is dependent on the first part (Tom watching football), if Tom does not watch football, then by definition, Jen cannot be watching basketball because the condition for her to do so is not met.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
