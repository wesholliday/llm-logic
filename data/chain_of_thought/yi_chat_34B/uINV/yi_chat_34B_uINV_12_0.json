This means that whenever Joe goes to the park, Lucy also goes to the zoo.\n3. However, the statement does not specify what happens when Joe *does not* go to the park.\n4. We cannot infer from the information provided whether Lucy would also not go to the zoo if Joe did not go to the park.\n5. There might be other conditions or reasons that would cause Lucy to go to the zoo regardless of Joe's actions, or vice versa.\n6. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot conclude that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n",
