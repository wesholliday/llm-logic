            "content": "[RESP]Let's consider this statement logically: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This is a conditional statement where A (apple being red) is the antecedent and B (banana being yellow) is the consequent. The statement is given as true.\n\nNow, we are asked to infer whether \"if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\" This would be the contrapositive of the original statement, which is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement. In other words, if the original statement is true, so is its contrapositive.\n\nThe contrapositive of A \u2192 B is \u00acA \u2192 \u00acB. So, we are looking at:\n\nIf not A (apple was not red) then not B (banana was not yellow).\n\nSince the original statement (A \u2192 B) is true, by logical equivalence, its contrapositive (\u00acA \u2192 \u00acB) must also be true. Therefore, we can infer that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.<|im_end|>\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Excellent! The logic behind this inference is sound and based on the principle",
