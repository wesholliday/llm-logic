The statement can be written as A \u2192 B, which means that if A (vampire awake) is true, then B (mummy awake) must also be true.\n\nNow, we are asked to infer whether \"if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake\" is true or not. This can be represented as \u00acA \u2192 \u00acB, where \u00acA means 'not A' and \u00acB means 'not B'.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, a conditional statement (if A then B) does not imply that if not A, then not B. In other words, just because we know that when the vampire is awake, the mummy is also awake, it does not necessarily mean that when the vampire is not awake, the mummy must also be not awake. There could be situations where the vampire is asleep and the mummy is still awake, or vice versa.\n\nTherefore",
