This is a conditional statement where \"cake being chocolate\" is the condition (or hypothesis) and \"muffins being blueberry\" is the consequence (or conclusion). We can represent this as A \u2192 B, where A is \"cake is chocolate\" and B is \"muffins are blueberry.\"\n\n2. The question now asks us to consider the opposite scenario: If the cake is not chocolate (\u00acA), what can we say about the muffins? The logical inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true in the same way. Just because A \u2192 B does not mean that \u00acA \u2192 \u00acB.\n\n3. To infer that if the cake is not chocolate, then the muffins are not blueberry (\u00acA \u2192 \u00acB) would require an additional piece of information: that if the cake is not chocolate, then the muffins must also be something other than blueberry. This additional information is not provided, so we cannot make this inference.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer that if the cake was not chocolate",
