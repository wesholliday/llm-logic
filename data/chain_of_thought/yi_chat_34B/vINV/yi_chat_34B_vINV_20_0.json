This can be represented as an implication: \"Apple red -> Banana yellow\".\n\n2. The conclusion states that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow. This can also be represented as an implication: \"Not Apple red -> Not Banana yellow\".\n\n3. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the premise implies the conclusion. In other words, does it follow that if the apple is not red, then the banana cannot be yellow?\n\n4. According to the law of contraposition in logic, an implication \"A -> B\" is true if and only if its contrapositive \"Not B -> Not A\" is true. The contrapositive of \"Apple red -> Banana yellow\" would be \"Not Banana yellow -> Not Apple red\".\n\n5. However, the conclusion states \"Not Apple red -> Not Banana yellow\", which is not the same as the contrapositive. Therefore, the premise does not imply the conclusion directly, and we cannot infer that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not",
