This can be represented as an implication: If P (Sam takes a plane), then Q (Erin takes a train).\n\n2. The conclusion states that if Sam did not take a plane (\u00acP), then Erin did not take a train (\u00acQ). This is the contrapositive of the premise, which is logically equivalent to the original implication.\n\n3. In logic, it is known that an implication is true unless its antecedent (the 'if' part) is true and its consequent (the 'then' part) is false. Since the conclusion presents the contrapositive, which is logically equivalent to the premise, it must also be true if the premise is true.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the validity of the contrapositive, the argument form is logically valid.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>",
