The argument is based on a conditional statement (also known as an if-then statement) that connects two events: Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt.\n2. The premise states that if one event occurs (Lisa buying the red shirt), then another event must occur (Mark buying the blue shirt). This is represented by the conditional A \u2192 B, where A is Lisa buying the red shirt and B is Mark buying the blue shirt.\n3. The conclusion of the argument states that if the first event does not occur (Lisa not buying the red shirt), then the second event also does not occur (Mark not buying the blue shirt). This can be represented by A' \u2192 B', where A' is Lisa not buying the red shirt and B' is Mark not buying the blue shirt.\n4. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise. In other words, does the truth of the premise guarantee the truth of the conclusion?\n5. According to the rules of logic for conditional statements, if A \u2192 B is true and A' is true (Lisa did not buy the red",
