This can be represented as an implication: If A (Joe goes to the park), then B (Lucy goes to the zoo).\n\n2. The conclusion states that if Joe did not go to the park (not-A), then Lucy did not go to the zoo (not-B). This is also an implication: If not-A, then not-B.\n\n3. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise. In other words, does the truth of the premise guarantee the truth of the conclusion?\n\n4. According to the law of contraposition in logic, an implication (A -> B) is logically equivalent to another implication (not-B -> not-A). This means that if we know A implies B, then we also know that not-B implies not-A.\n\n5. Applying this to the argument at hand: If we know that if A (Joe goes to the park), then B (Lucy goes to the zoo), then it follows logically that",
