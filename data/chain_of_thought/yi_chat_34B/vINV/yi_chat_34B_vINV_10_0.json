This can be represented as an implication: \"Dog inside \u2192 Cat outside\".\n\n2. The conclusion states that if the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside. This can be represented as another implication: \"Dog not inside \u2192 Cat not outside\".\n\n3. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the premise implies the conclusion. In other words, does it follow necessarily that if the dog is not inside, then the cat is not outside, given that if the dog is inside, the cat is outside?\n\n4. Intuitively, this does not seem to be the case. Just because we know that if the dog is inside, the cat is outside, does not mean that when the dog is not inside, the cat must also not be outside. The cat's location could be independent of the dog's location, or there could be other conditions that determine where the cat is.\n\n5. Therefore, based on this reasoning, the argument form does not seem to be logically valid because it assumes a relationship between the locations of the dog and",
