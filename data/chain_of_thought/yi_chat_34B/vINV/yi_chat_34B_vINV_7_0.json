This suggests a direct relationship between their finishing the race.\n2. The conclusion states that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris also did not finish the race. This is essentially the negation of the premise (since it's the contrapositive of the original conditional statement).\n3. In logic, a valid argument is one where the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n4. The form of this argument is known as modus tollens, which is a valid logical argument form if the initial premise is true.\n5. However, in this case, we are not given any information about the actual outcomes of Alex and Chris finishing the race. We only have the conditional statement linking their actions.\n6. Without additional information about whether either Alex or Chris actually finished the race, we cannot determine the truth value of the conclusion based solely on the premise provided.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I would say that the form of the argument is logically valid in terms of its structure (modus tollens), but without further evidence about the actual outcomes of Alex and Chris,",
