The argument is based on a conditional statement (also known as an if-then statement) that connects two events: Sue choosing pizza and Bob choosing pasta.\n2. The premise states that if the first event occurs (Sue chooses pizza), then the second event must also occur (Bob chooses pasta). This is represented by the logical form A -> B, where A is 'Sue chooses pizza' and B is 'Bob chooses pasta'.\n3. The conclusion of the argument reverses the direction of the conditional statement. It states that if the first event does not occur (Sue does not choose pizza), then the second event also does not occur (Bob does not choose pasta). This is represented by the logical form \u00acA -> \u00acB.\n4. To determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise. In other words, if the premise is true, does it guarantee that the conclusion must also be true?\n5. According to the law of contraposition in logic, A -> B is logically equivalent to \u00acB -> \u00acA. This means that if we can infer \u00acB from ",
