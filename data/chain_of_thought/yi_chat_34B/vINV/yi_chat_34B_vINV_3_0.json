This can be represented as \"If A (James), then B (mystery novel)\" or \"A -> B\" in symbolic form.\n\n2. The conclusion states that if the book was not written by James, then it is not a mystery novel. In symbolic form, this can be represented as \"If not A, then not B\" or \"\u00acA -> \u00acB\".\n\n3. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows from the premise. In other words, does \"\u00acA -> \u00acB\" follow from \"A -> B\"?\n\n4. According to the law of contraposition in logic, which states that for any logical statement A -> B, it is equivalent to say \u00acB -> \u00acA. Applying this to our premise and conclusion:\n   - From \"A -> B\" (If James, then mystery novel), we can infer \"\u00acB -> \u00acA\" (If not mystery novel, then not James).\n   - But the conclusion is \"\u00acA",
