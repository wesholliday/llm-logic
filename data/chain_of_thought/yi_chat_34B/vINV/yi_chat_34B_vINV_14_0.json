This is a conditional statement where 'if A, then B' can be represented as A \u2192 B.\n\n2. The conclusion states that if the bear was not in the cave (\u00acA), then the wolf was not in the den (\u00acB). This is also a conditional statement, but with negated premises and conclusions.\n\n3. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows from the premise. In other words, does \u00ac(A \u2192 B) imply \u00acA \u2192 \u00acB?\n\n4. According to the contrapositive rule in logic, A \u2192 B is equivalent to \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA. Therefore, the premise (A \u2192 B) is logically equivalent to (\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA).\n\n5. Since we are looking at the validity of the argument, we can replace the premise with its contrapositive form: If not B, then not A.\n\n6. Now, if we have \u00ac(A \u2192 B), which is logically equivalent to A ",
