The argument presents a conditional statement in its premise: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This can be represented as 'Tom watching football' implies 'Jen watching basketball' (T \u2192 J).\n\n2. The conclusion of the argument is another conditional statement: \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\" This can be represented as 'Not T' implies 'Not J' (\u00acT \u2192 \u00acJ).\n\n3. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise. In other words, does the truth of the premise guarantee the truth of the conclusion?\n\n4. One way to assess this is through the contrapositive rule, which states that a conditional statement (A \u2192 B) is true if and only if its contrapositive (\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA) is true. The contrapositive of 'T \u2192 J' is '\u00acJ \u2192 \u00acT', and the contrapositive of '\u00acT \u2192 \u00acJ' is 'J \u2192 T'.\n\n5. However, the argument does not switch from the original premise to its contra",
