This suggests a logical connection between Mary's presence and Sue's presence.\n2. The conclusion states that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not there either. This is essentially saying that if the condition in the premise (Mary being present) is not met, then the consequence (Sue being present) does not occur.\n3. Logically, this form of argument is known as an \"inverse\" or \"converse\" of the original premise. In a valid inverse, if the hypothesis (in this case, Mary's presence) is false, then the conclusion (Sue's presence) must also be false.\n4. The validity of this type of argument depends on whether the premises and conclusion are related in a logically consistent manner. If the premise is true when its hypothesis is true, and the conclusion is true when the premise's hypothesis is false, then the argument form is valid.\n\nAfter explaining my reasoning, I conclude that:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\nThe argument form is logically valid because it follows a valid pattern of inference where",
