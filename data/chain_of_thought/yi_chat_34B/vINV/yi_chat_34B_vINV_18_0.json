            "content": "\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. The argument is based on a conditional statement (if-then) that connects two premises: If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n2. A conditional statement can be converted into its contrapositive form, which states the opposite of both parts of the original statement: If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\n3. The argument's conclusion is essentially stating the same thing as the contrapositive of the premise: If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\n4. Logical validity means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. In this case, if the original premise (if-then statement) is true, then its contrapositive (which includes the argument's conclusion) must also be true.\n5. Therefore, since the argument's conclusion matches the form of the logically necessary contrapositive of the premise, the argument is logically valid.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n",
