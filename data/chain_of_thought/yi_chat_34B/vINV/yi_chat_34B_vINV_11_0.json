This can be represented as an implication: CakeChocolate \u2192 MuffinsBlueberry.\n\n2. The conclusion states that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry. This can also be represented as an implication: \u00acCakeChocolate \u2192 \u00acMuffinsBlueberry.\n\n3. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the premise implies the conclusion. In other words, does it follow that if CakeChocolate is true, then MuffinsBlueberry must also be true? And conversely, if \u00acCakeChocolate is true, then \u00acMuffinsBlueberry must also be true?\n\n4. Intuitively, we might think that these implications do not necessarily follow from each other. Just because the cake is chocolate does not mean that the muffins have to be blueberry, and vice versa.\n\n5. However, if we consider the contrapositive of both implications, which are logically equivalent to the original implications, we get: MuffinsBlueberry \u2192 CakeChocolate and ",
