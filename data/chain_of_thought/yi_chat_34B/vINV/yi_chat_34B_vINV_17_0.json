The argument presents a conditional statement in its premise: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This can be represented as an if-then statement or a logical implication, where 'Ben eating pasta' is the antecedent (P) and 'Kate eating salad' is the consequent (Q).\n\n2. The argument also presents another conditional statement in its conclusion: \"If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad.\" This can be represented as a second if-then statement or logical implication, where 'Ben not eating pasta' is the antecedent (\u00acP) and 'Kate not eating salad' is the consequent (\u00acQ).\n\n3. The form of the argument seems to be trying to reverse the direction of the original conditional in the premise. However, reversing the direction of a conditional does not necessarily preserve the logical relationship between the antecedent and the consequent.\n\n4. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we would need to check if the premises could possibly be true while the conclusion is false. In this case, it's possible that Ben did not eat pasta but",
