The conclusion states that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake either (\"If not A, then not B\").\n3. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the conclusion follows from the premise.\n4. In classical logic, an \"if-then\" statement is considered true only when the antecedent (the part before the 'if') is true and the consequent (the part after the 'then') is also true. If either one is false, the entire statement is considered false.\n5. The argument in question is trying to reverse the direction of the \"if-then\" relationship by saying that if the antecedent (vampire being awake) is false, then the consequent (mummy being awake) must also be false.\n6. However, this reversal does not necessarily follow from the original premise. Just because we know that if A is true, B is also true, does not mean that if A is false, B",
