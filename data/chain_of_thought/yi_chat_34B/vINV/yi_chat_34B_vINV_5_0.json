            "content": "\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. The given premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. This can be represented as \"Jeff playing basketball\" implies \"Amy playing tennis\" or symbolically as \"If A, then B\" where 'A' represents 'Jeff playing basketball' and 'B' represents 'Amy playing tennis'.\n\n2. The conclusion states that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis. This can be represented as \"Jeff not playing basketball\" implies \"Amy not playing tennis\" or symbolically as \"If not A, then not B\".\n\n3. To determine the validity of this argument, we need to consider whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In other words, does it make sense that if the premise is true (Jeff plays basketball), the conclusion must also be true (Amy plays tennis)? Conversely, if the premise is false (Jeff does not play basketball), does the conclusion still follow logically (Amy does not play tennis)?\n\n4. Intuitively, it seems that if Jeff did not play basketball, there would be no reason to assume that Amy played tennis just because of Jeff's inactivity.",
