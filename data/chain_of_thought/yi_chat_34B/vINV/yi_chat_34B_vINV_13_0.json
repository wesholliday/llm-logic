The given argument has a premise that states \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The conclusion of the argument states \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\" This can be rephrased as \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\n3. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the conclusion follows from the premise. In other words, does knowing that \"if A, then B\" necessarily mean that \"if not A, then not B\"?\n\n4. According to the law of contraposition in logic, which states that for any conditional statement \"If A, then B,\" it is logically equivalent to say \"If not B, then not A.\" This means that if we know the truck was not blue, we can conclude that the car was not red.\n\n5. However, the argument tries to reverse this relationship by saying that if the car was not red, then the truck must also be not blue. This reversal is not logically valid; it does not follow from",
