This can be represented as an implication A \u2192 B, where A is 'the alien visited Mars' and B is 'the robot visited Jupiter'.\n\n2. The conclusion states that if the alien did not visit Mars (\u00acA), then the robot did not visit Jupiter (\u00acB). This can be represented as another implication \u00acA \u2192 \u00acB.\n\n3. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the premise implies the conclusion. In other words, we need to see if A \u2192 B logically implies \u00acA \u2192 \u00acB.\n\n4. According to the contrapositive rule in logic, an implication A \u2192 B is true if and only if its contrapositive (\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA) is true. This means that if we can show that \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA is true, then by extension, \u00acA \u2192 \u00acB would also be true, making the argument logically valid.\n\n5. The contrapositive of A \u2192 B is \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA, which is not the same as the",
