It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled. (Premise 2)\n\nWe are asked to determine if we can infer 'The sprocket was not cranked' from these premises.\n\nTo start, Premise 1 is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\" This means that if A (the sprocket being cranked) happens, then B (the sprocket being daggled) must also happen.\n\nPremise 2 tells us that it's not the case that B (the sprocket being daggled) must have happened. In other words, B is not a necessary consequence of A.\n\nNow, if we combine these two premises, we can see that since B (the sprocket being daggled) is not a necessary consequence of A (the sprocket being cranked), and Premise 2 tells us that B did not happen,",
