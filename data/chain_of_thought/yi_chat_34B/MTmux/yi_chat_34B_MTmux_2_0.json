In other words, it denies the truth of Q.\n\nNow, we are asked to infer whether \"The wug was not flooped\" can be concluded from these two statements. To do this, we need to consider the relationship between P and Q in the original conditional statement.\n\nIf we know that Q is false (the wug did not bim the zoint), then according to the contrapositive of a conditional statement (which is logically equivalent to the original statement), we can conclude that if Q is false, then P must also be false. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q",
