            "content": "[SYS]Let's break down the statements provided:\n\n1. \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink.\" This is a conditional statement that can be represented as A \u2192 B, where 'A' stands for 'the grommet was sploffed' and 'B' stands for 'the grommet must have plopped the frink'.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink.\" This statement is denying B, meaning it can be represented as \u00acB.\n\nNow, we are asked to infer 'The grommet was not sploffed' (which is \u00acA) from these two statements. To do this, we need to consider the logical relationship between A and B in the first statement and the denial of B in the second statement.\n\nIf we have A \u2192 B and \u00acB, we can use the contrapositive rule of inference, which states that if A \u2192 B is true, then \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA is also true. The contrapositive flips both the antecedent (A)",
