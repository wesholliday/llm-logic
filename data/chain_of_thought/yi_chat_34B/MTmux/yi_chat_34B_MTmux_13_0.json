It's represented as A \u2192 B, where A is \"the glip was slogged\" and B is \"the glip must have tragged.\"\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the glip must have tragged.\" This statement tells us that B (the glip tragging) did not happen. In other words, it negates the conclusion of the conditional statement.\n\nNow, we are asked if we can infer \"The glip was not slogged\" from these two statements. To answer this, we need to consider the logical relationship between A and B in the original conditional statement. If B (the glip tragging) did not happen as per the second statement, then according to the first statement (A \u2192 B), A (the glip being slogged) cannot be true either, because if it were,",
