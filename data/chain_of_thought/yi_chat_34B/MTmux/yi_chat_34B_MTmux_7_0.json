In other words, it denies the truth of B.\n\nNow, we are asked to infer whether \"The whiffle was not shanked\" (which is the negation of A) can be concluded from these two statements.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the validity of the original conditional statement (A \u2192 B) and the fact that B is false. According to the contrapositive rule in logic, if A \u2192 B is true, then not(B) \u2192 not(A) is also true. However, since we know that B is false, this does not necessarily mean that not(A) must be true (the whiffle might have",
