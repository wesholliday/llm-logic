It provides us with a piece of information about what didn't happen, but it doesn't tell us anything about whether the sneg was crampled or not.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot directly infer that \"The sneg was not crampled\" because the second statement only tells us that the sneg not sproting the frink is a possibility, not that the sneg being crampled is impossible. The first statement implies that if the sneg were crampled, it would have sproted the frink, but since we know the sneg didn't sprot the frink, we still cannot",
