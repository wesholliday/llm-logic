It means that if the wug was sproinged (the antecedent), then it necessarily follows that it was also garpled (the consequent).\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the wug must have been garpled\" - This statement asserts that the wug being garpled is not a necessary condition. In other words, even if the wug were sproinged, it might not have been garled.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that:\n\n- The wug being sproinged does not necessarily lead to it being garpled.\n- There is at least one possible scenario where the wug is sproinged but not garpled.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot conclude that \"The wug was not sproinged\" because there might be scenarios where the wug is both sproinged and garpled, as well as scenarios where it is only sproinged without being garpled",
