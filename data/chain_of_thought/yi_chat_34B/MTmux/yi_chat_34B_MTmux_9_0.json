The first statement is \"If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished.\" This is a conditional statement that expresses a logical relationship between two events: plinking and varnishing. It can be represented as 'P \u2192 V', where P stands for 'the twonk was plinked' and V stands for 'the twonk was varnished'.\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the twonk must have been varnished.\" This means that it is not necessarily true that the twonk was varnished. In other words, there is a possibility that the twonk was not varnished. We can represent this as '\u00acV', where \u00ac is the negation operator.\n\n3. The third statement we are trying to infer is \"The twonk was not plinked.\" This can be represented as '\u00acP'.\n\nNow, let's try to connect",
