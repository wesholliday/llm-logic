In other words, we can represent this as \u00acB.\n\nNow, given these two statements, we want to infer whether \"The dreb was not vroombed\" (which can be represented as \u00acA) is true or false.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule for conditional statements, which states that if A \u2192 B is true, then \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA is also true, we can infer that if \u00acB (the dreb must not have been spened) is true, then \u00acA (the dreb was not vroombed) must be",
