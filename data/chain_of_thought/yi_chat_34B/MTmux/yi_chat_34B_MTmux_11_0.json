In other words, we can represent this as \u00acB.\n\nNow, we are asked to infer whether 'The flug was not blummed' (which can be represented as \u00acA) can be concluded from the given information.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule of inference, which states that if A \u2192 B is true, then \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA is also true, we can infer that if it is not the case that the flug must have been zimmed (\u00acB), then the flug was not blummed (\u00acA).\n\nTherefore",
