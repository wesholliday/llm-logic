The first statement is \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled.\" This is a conditional statement of the form A -> B, where 'A' represents 'The flugel was blimmed' and 'B' represents 'The flugel must have been zargled.'\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the flugel must have been zargled.\" This means that B (the flugel must have been zargled) is false. In other words, we can infer that 'The flugel was not zargled.'\n\n3. Now, given that 'The flugel was not zargled' and the original conditional statement A -> B, we can apply the contrapositive rule, which states that if A -> B is true, then not(B) -> not(A) is also true. In other words, since we know B (the flugel must have",
