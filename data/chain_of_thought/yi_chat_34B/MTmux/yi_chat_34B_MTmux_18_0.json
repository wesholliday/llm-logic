It's represented as A \u2192 B, where A is \"the shank was plooked\" and B is \"the shank must have been nugged.\"\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the shank must have been nugged.\" This statement tells us that B (the shank being nugged) did not happen. In other words, it negates the conclusion of the conditional statement.\n\nNow, we are asked if we can infer \"The shank was not plooked\" from these two statements. To answer this, let's consider the contrapositive of the original conditional statement: If B does not happen (the shank is not nugged), then A cannot have happened (the shank cannot have been plooked). This is represented as \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA.",
