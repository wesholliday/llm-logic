The first statement is in the form of an if-then proposition: \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged.\" This means that if the clug was indeed fleeked, it would be necessary for it to also be snugged.\n\n2. The second statement provides information about what is not the case: \"It's not the case that the clug must have been snugged.\" This implies that although the first statement suggests that if the clug were fleeked, it would have to be snugged, this is not actually the case (i.e., the clug does not have to be snugged).\n\n3. The third statement we are trying to infer is \"The clug was not fleeked.\" To make this inference, we need to consider that if being fleeked would necessarily lead to the clug being snugged, and yet it's not the case that the clug must be snug",
