In other words, it denies the conclusion of the conditional statement A \u2192 B.\n\nNow, we are asked if we can infer 'The zinger was not fraggled' (which is the negation of A) from these two statements. To answer this question, let's consider the logical structure:\n\n- If A then B (A \u2192 B)\n- Not B (\u00acB)\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that \u00acB is true. However, the first statement tells us what would happen if A were true (B would also be true), but it does not provide any information about what happens when B is false (which is",
