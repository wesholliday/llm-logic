The first statement is \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked.\" This is a conditional statement that can be represented as A \u2192 B, where 'A' stands for 'the fribble was snurgled' and 'B' stands for 'the fribble must have crinked.'\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the fribble must have crinked.\" This means that B (the fribble must have crinked) is false. In other words, we can represent this as \u00acB.\n\n3. To infer 'The fribble was not snurgled' (which is \u00acA) from the given statements, we need to use the contrapositive rule of inference, which states that if A \u2192 B is true, and \u00acB is true, then we can conclude \u00acA.\n\n4. However, in this case, we only have information about B being",
