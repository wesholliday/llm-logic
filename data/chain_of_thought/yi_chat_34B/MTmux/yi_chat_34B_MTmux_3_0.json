The first statement is \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked.\" This is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between two events: morphing the splat and it quanking as a result.\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the splat must have quanked.\" This means that we are told explicitly that the splat did not necessarily quank, despite whatever conditions might be in place.\n\n3. To infer 'The splat was not morphed' from these two statements, we would need to show that if the splat did not quank, then it must not have been morphed. However, this is not directly stated or logically implied by the information provided.\n\n4. The first statement only tells us what would happen if the splat were morphed; it does not provide any information about what happens when the splat does not quank.\n\n5. Since we are told that the splat did not necessarily",
