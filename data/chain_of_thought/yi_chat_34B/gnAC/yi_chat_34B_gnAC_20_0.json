We are given two pieces of information:\n   - \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" (Premise 1)\n   - \"The banana was yellow\" (Premise 2)\n\n2. Premise 1 is a conditional statement that can be represented as 'A \u2192 B' where 'A' is 'The apple was red' and 'B' is 'The banana was yellow'.\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if both the antecedent (A) and the consequent (B) of a conditional statement are true, then the conditional itself is true. This means that since Premise 1 is true and Premise 2 is true, the conditional 'A \u2192 B' must also be true.\n\n4. However, the truth of 'A \u2192 B' does not necessarily mean that 'A' (The apple was red) is true; it only means that if 'A' were true, then 'B' would have to be true as well.\n\n5. To determine whether 'The apple was red' (A) is true, we need additional information or a separate premise",
