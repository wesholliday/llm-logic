We are given two pieces of information:\n   - \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" (conditional statement in the form of an if-then statement)\n   - \"The truck was blue\" (consequent of the conditional statement)\n\n2. The second piece of information confirms that the consequent of the conditional statement is true.\n\n3. To determine whether the antecedent (\"The car was red\") is also true, we need to consider the validity of the conditional statement itself.\n\n4. A conditional statement is considered valid if the consequent follows logically from the antecedent. In this case, since we know the truck was blue, and given that \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is true, it suggests that the car being red does indeed lead to the truck being blue.\n\n5. However, the truth of the conditional statement alone does not guarantee that the antecedent (\"The car was red\") is also true. It only guarantees that if the car were red, the truck would be blue.\n\n6. Therefore, based on the information provided, we",
