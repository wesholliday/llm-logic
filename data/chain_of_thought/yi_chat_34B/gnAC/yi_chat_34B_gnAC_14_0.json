We are given two pieces of information:\n   - If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den (conditional statement).\n   - The wolf was in the den (consequent of the conditional statement).\n\n2. According to the rules of logic for a conditional statement, if the consequent is true, there are two possibilities:\n   a. The antecedent (the bear being in the cave) is also true, which would make the entire conditional statement true.\n   b. The antecedent is false, and some other condition is causing the consequent to be true.\n\n3. We are also given that the wolf was in the den, which confirms the truth of the consequent.\n\n4. Since we cannot determine from the information provided whether there is another condition that could cause the wolf to be in the den without the bear being in the cave, we cannot definitively conclude that the antecedent (the bear being in the cave) is true.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we can only say that it is possible but not necessarily true that the bear was in the cave",
