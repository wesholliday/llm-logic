We are given two pieces of information:\n   - If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel (Premise 1).\n   - The book is a mystery novel (Premise 2).\n\n2. Premise 1 is in the form of an if-then statement, which means it follows the logical rule that if the 'if' part (the antecedent) is true, and the 'then' part (the consequent) is true, then the entire statement is true.\n\n3. Premise 2 tells us that the book is a mystery novel, which matches the consequent in Premise 1.\n\n4. Since both premises are true, we can conclude that the if-then statement in Premise 1 is true.\n\n5. The if-then statement in Premise 1 has two parts: the antecedent ('The book was written by James') and the consequent ('The book is a mystery novel'). We have already established that the consequent is true (Premise 2), and now we know that the entire if-then statement is",
