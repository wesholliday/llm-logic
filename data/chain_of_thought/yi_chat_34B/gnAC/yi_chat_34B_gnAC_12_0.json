We are given two pieces of information:\n   - \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" (conditional statement)\n   - \"Lucy went to the zoo\" (consequent of the conditional statement)\n\n2. The first piece of information is a conditional statement, which can be represented as an if-then proposition: If A, then B.\n\n3. The second piece of information tells us that B (Lucy going to the zoo) is true.\n\n4. To determine whether Joe went to the park (A in our representation), we need to consider the truth value of the conditional statement as a whole.\n\n5. In a valid argument from the conditional statement, if the consequent (B) is true and the conditional statement is true, then the antecedent (A) must also be true.\n\n6. Since we know that \"Lucy went to the zoo\" (B) is true and \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" (the conditional statement A -> B) is true, it logically follows that \"Joe went to the park\" (A) must",
