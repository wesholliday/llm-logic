We are given two pieces of information:\n   - \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" (conditional statement in the form of an if-then statement)\n   - \"The muffins were blueberry\" (consequent of the conditional statement)\n\n2. The second piece of information confirms that the consequent is true.\n\n3. Since the second piece of information confirms the truth of the consequent, we can apply the rule for conditional statements that if the consequent is true, then the entire conditional statement (if-then) is true only if the antecedent (the 'if' part) is also true.\n\n4. Therefore, to determine whether \"The cake was chocolate\" is true, we need to check if the antecedent of the conditional statement is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
