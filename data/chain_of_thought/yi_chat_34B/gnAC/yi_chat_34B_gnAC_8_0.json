We are given two pieces of information:\n   - \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" (conditional statement in the form of an if-then proposition)\n   - \"The mummy was awake\" (a factual statement)\n\n2. The second piece of information tells us that the mummy was awake.\n\n3. We need to determine whether the first piece of information implies that the vampire was also awake, given that we know the mummy was awake.\n\n4. The conditional statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is true. In a true conditional statement, if the second part (the 'then' part) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the first part (the 'if' part) is also true. This is because a conditional statement can be true even if the antecedent (the 'if' part) is false and the consequent (the 'then' part) is true.\n\n5. In this case, we know the mummy was awake, which matches the consequent of the conditional statement. However, without additional information about the vampire's state, we",
