We are given two pieces of information:\n   - \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" (conditional statement)\n   - \"The unicorn was in the forest\" (assertion)\n\n2. The second piece of information confirms that the unicorn was indeed in the forest.\n\n3. The first piece of information is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the part before 'then') is true, then the consequent (the part after 'then') must also be true.\n\n4. Since we know that the unicorn was in the forest, and this fact confirms the consequent of the conditional statement, it logically follows that the antecedent (the griffin being in the forest) must also be true.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the truth of both the conditional statement and the assertion about the unicorn, we can conclude that 'The griffin was in the forest' is indeed true.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[END]",
