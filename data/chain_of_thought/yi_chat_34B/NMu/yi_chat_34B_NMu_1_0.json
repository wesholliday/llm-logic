            "content": "[SYS]To determine whether we can infer 'Mary might not have been at the wedding' from 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding', let's consider the meaning of each statement.\n\n1. \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" implies that there is no necessity for Mary to have been at the wedding. It suggests that her presence was not mandatory or required in any way.\n\n2. \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" indicates that there is a possibility that Mary was not present at the wedding. It does not assert with certainty that she was absent, but rather leaves open the option that she could have been absent.\n\nGiven these interpretations, we can see that the first statement directly contradicts any notion of necessity for Mary to be at the wedding, while the second statement suggests a mere possibility of her absence. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can infer 'Mary might not have been at the wedding' from 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.'\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Excellent! Your reasoning is sound and aligns with the logical implications of the statements given",
