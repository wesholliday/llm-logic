So, when we say \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza,\" we are saying the opposite of \"Sue must have chosen pizza.\" The word \"must\" implies certainty or necessity; it suggests that there is no other possibility than Sue choosing pizza. When we negate this statement, we are saying that Sue does not have to choose pizza; there is no necessity for her to do so.\n\nThe phrase \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" indicates a potential lack of choice or an alternative possibility. It suggests that while it's possible that Sue chose pizza, it's also possible that she did not.
