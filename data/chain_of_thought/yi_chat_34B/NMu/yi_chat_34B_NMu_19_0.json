It suggests that there are other possibilities for where the watch could be.\n\n2. 'The watch might not be charging on the dresser' is a statement that indicates there is a possibility that the watch is not charging on the dresser, but it does not rule out the possibility that it could be charging there. It leaves open the idea that it might be somewhere else or not charging at all.\n\nGiven these interpretations, we can see that the first statement directly supports the second statement. If it's not necessary for the watch to be charging on the dresser, then it logically follows that it might not be doing so. Therefore, based on this reasoning, we can infer 'The watch might not be charging on the dresser' from 'It's not the case that the watch",
