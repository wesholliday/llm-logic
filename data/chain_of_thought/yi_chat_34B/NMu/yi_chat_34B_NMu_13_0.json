This means that the presence of the toy in the toy box is not certain or required.\n\n2. \"The toy might not be in the toy box\" directly states that there is a chance the toy is not in the toy box.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can see that they are expressing the same idea: There is a possibility that the toy is not in the toy box. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that \"The toy might not be in the toy box\" from the statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box.\"\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Yes<|im_end|>\n",
