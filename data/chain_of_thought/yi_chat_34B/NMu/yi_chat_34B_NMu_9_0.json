The statement \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" is equivalent to saying \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt.\"\n2. This is because in logic, when we say \"It's not the case that X,\" we are negating the idea of X being true.\n3. In this context, \"X\" refers to Lisa being obligated or required to buy the red shirt.\n4. By negating this obligation, we are left with the possibility that Lisa did not have to buy the red shirt, which is another way of saying she might not have bought it.\n5. Therefore, from the given statement, we can indeed infer \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt.\"<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
