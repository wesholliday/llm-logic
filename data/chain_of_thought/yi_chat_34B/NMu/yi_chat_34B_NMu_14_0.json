            "content": "[SYS]To determine whether we can infer 'The milk might not be on the counter' from 'It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter', let's break down the statements:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter\" is a negative statement that implies there is no necessity for the milk to be on the counter. It suggests that the location of the milk is not fixed and could be elsewhere.\n\n2. 'The milk might not be on the counter' is a statement that indicates the possibility that the milk is not on the counter. It does not necessarily mean that the milk is definitely not there, but rather that it could be somewhere else or even missing.\n\nGiven these interpretations, we can see that the first statement directly contradicts the idea of 'must' being on the counter, which implies that the second statement ('The milk might not be on the counter') is a valid inference. The absence of a 'must' condition allows for the possibility that the milk is not on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n",
