It suggests that there is no requirement for the sunglasses to be in her bag; they are not necessarily present. This does not directly confirm that the sunglasses are absent, but it does leave open the possibility that they might not be in the bag.\n\nIn logic, \"not necessary\" does not always mean \"impossible,\" but rather \"not guaranteed.\" Therefore, we can conclude that since the sunglasses are not necessarily in her bag, there is a chance that they might not be present.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Yes<|im_end|>\n",
