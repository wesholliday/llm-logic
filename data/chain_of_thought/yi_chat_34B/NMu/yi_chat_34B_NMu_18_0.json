The statement \"It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer\" implies that there is a possibility that the notebook is not in the drawer.\n2. In logic, when we say \"It's not the case that A must be B,\" it means that there are situations where A is not B.\n3. Applying this to our statement, \"It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer,\" means that there are instances where the notebook is not in the drawer.\n4. Therefore, we can infer from the given statement that \"The notebook might not be in the drawer.\"<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
