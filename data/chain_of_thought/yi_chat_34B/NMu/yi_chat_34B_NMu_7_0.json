The statement \"It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race\" is equivalent to saying \"Alex might not have finished the race.\"\n2. This is because in logic, when we say \"It's not the case that X,\" we are negating X. So, if we negate \"Alex must have finished the race,\" we get \"Alex might not have finished the race.\"\n3. Therefore, directly from the given statement, we can infer the same conclusion without any additional information or reasoning.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n",
