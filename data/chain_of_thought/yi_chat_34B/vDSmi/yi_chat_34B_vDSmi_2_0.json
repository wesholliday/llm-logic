This is a disjunction, meaning that one of two things must be true.\n\n2. The second premise says that the book might not be resting on the table. This means that the possibility of the book being on the table cannot be ruled out, but it also does not confirm that it is on the table.\n\n3. Since the first premise is a disjunction and the second premise allows for the possibility that the book is not on the table, the only remaining option to satisfy the first premise is that the book must be on the shelf.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the given premises, it logically follows that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
