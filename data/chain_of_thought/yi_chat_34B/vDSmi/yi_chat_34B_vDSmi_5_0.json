Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry.\n2. The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\n3. Therefore, the cookies are in the jar.\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n- Premise 1 states that the cookies are either in the jar or in the pantry. It presents two possibilities without committing to one over the other.\n- Premise 2 suggests that one of those possibilities (the cookies being in the pantry) might not be true.\n- The conclusion then asserts that because it's possible that the cookies aren't in the pantry, they must be in the jar.\n\nThe issue with this argument is that it commits a logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\" This fallacy occurs when one infers the antecedent of a conditional statement from the truth of its consequent. In other words, it's assuming that because something might not be true (the cookies being in the pantry), the opposite must be true (",
