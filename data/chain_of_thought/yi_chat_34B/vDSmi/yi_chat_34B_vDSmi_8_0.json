This is a disjunction, meaning that if one part is not true, the other part must be true.\n\n2. The second premise says that the remote control might not be hiding under the couch. Since \"might not\" implies there's a possibility that it isn't, this means that the first part of the disjunction (the remote being on the coffee table) could be true if the second part (it hiding under the couch) is not.\n\n3. The conclusion states that the remote control is on the coffee table. If we take the first premise as given and consider the second premise, which allows for the possibility that the remote is not under the couch, then it follows logically that the remote must be where the disjunction says it could be: on the coffee table.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the argument appears to be logically valid because if one part of the disjunction is true (it's not under the couch), then by necessity the other part must be true (it's on the coffee table",
