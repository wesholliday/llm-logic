This presents two possibilities for where the keys could be.\n\n2. The second premise says that the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet. This means that we can eliminate one of the possibilities presented by the first premise.\n\n3. Since the keys are not dangling in the cabinet (according to the second premise), the only remaining possibility is that they must be in the drawer, as stated in the first premise.\n\n4.
