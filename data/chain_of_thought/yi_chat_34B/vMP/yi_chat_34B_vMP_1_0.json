The argument has two premises (If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding; Mary was at the wedding) and a conclusion (Sue was at the wedding).\n\nThe first premise is an If-Then statement, which in this case can be interpreted as a conditional statement where 'Mary being at the wedding' is the antecedent and 'Sue being at the wedding' is the consequent. The second premise provides evidence that the antecedent (Mary being at the wedding) is true. The conclusion then states that since the antecedent is true, the consequent must also be true.\n\nThis form of argument follows a valid logical pattern known as modus ponens, which is a rule of inference that allows us to conclude the truth of the consequent from the truth of the antecedent and the conditional statement. The structure of the argument is:\n\n1. If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q)\n2. P is true\n3. Therefore, Q must be true\n\nModus ponens",
