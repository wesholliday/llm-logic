This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\" where A = 'the book was written by James' and B = 'the book is a mystery novel'.\n\n2. The second premise asserts that the book was indeed written by James. This provides us with the necessary condition (A) for the first premise to apply.\n\n3. Since we have established that A (the book being written by James) is true, according to the first premise, B (the book being a mystery novel) must also be true.\n\n4. The conclusion states that the book is a mystery novel, which is exactly what the second premise says.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the argument appears to be logically valid because if the premises are true, then the conclusion necessarily follows.<|im_end|>\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
