The first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (conditional statement).\n3. The second premise confirms that the vampire was awake.\n4. The conclusion is that the mummy was awake.\n5. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the premises are true and if they logically support the conclusion.\n6. In this case, since the first premise is a conditional statement (if A then B) and the second premise confirms A (the vampire was awake), the conclusion that B must also be true (the mummy was awake) follows logically.\n7. Therefore, based on the truth of the premises and their logical relationship to the conclusion, this form of argument is logically valid.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n",
