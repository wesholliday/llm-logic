The first premise states that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim (conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\").\n3. The second premise confirms that the shirt is indeed cotton.\n4. The conclusion asserts that the pants are denim.\n5. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the premises, if true, would guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n6. In this case, since the first premise is a conditional statement and the second premise confirms the condition (the shirt being cotton), then according to the rules of logic, the conclusion (the pants being denim) must be true as well.\n7. Therefore, given that both premises are true, the conclusion follows necessarily, making the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
