This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n3. The second premise states that the apple was red. This provides information about one part of the conditional statement (A) being true.\n4. The conclusion states that the banana was yellow. This is claiming that the other part of the conditional statement (B) is also true, given that A is true.\n5. In a logically valid argument, if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true as well.\n6. Since the first premise is a conditional statement and the second premise confirms the condition (A) to be true, the conclusion (B) should follow if the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
