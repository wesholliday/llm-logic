The argument appears to be in the form of a syllogism with two premises and a conclusion. We can represent the argument symbolically as follows:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt (Premise 1).\n2. Lisa bought the red shirt (Premise 2).\n3. Therefore, Mark bought the blue shirt (Conclusion).\n\nThe logical structure of this argument is as follows:\n\n- Premise 1: If A then B (where 'A' stands for 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and 'B' stands for 'Mark bought the blue shirt').\n- Premise 2: A (Lisa bought the red shirt).\n- Conclusion: Therefore, B (Mark bought the blue shirt).\n\nThis structure follows the logical form of an implication: If A then B, A, therefore B.\n\nIn terms of validity, a valid argument is one where if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. In this case, if Premise 1 (",
