The first premise states that if the car was red, then the truck was blue (conditional statement).\n3. The second premise confirms that the car was red (asserting one of the conditions in the first premise).\n4. The conclusion asserts that the truck was blue, which is what the first premise says would be true if the condition (the car being red) were met.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the argument appears to be logically valid because it follows a valid logical form: If A then B, A, therefore B.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
