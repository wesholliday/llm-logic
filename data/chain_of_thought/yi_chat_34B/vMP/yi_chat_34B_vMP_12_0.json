The argument has two premises:\n\n1. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. (Premise 1)\n2. Joe went to the park. (Premise 2)\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n3. Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nWe can represent this argument using a truth table with three columns: one for each premise and one for the conclusion. There are four possible scenarios:\n\n1. Premise 1 is true, Premise 2 is true -> Conclusion must be true (by Modus Ponens)\n2. Premise 1 is false, Premise 2 is true -> Conclusion can't be determined (vacuous truth)\n3. Premise 1 is true, Premise 2 is false -> Conclusion can't be determined (false antecedent)\n4. Premise 1 is false, Premise 2 is false -> Conclusion must be false (by contradiction)\n",
