            "content": "\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. The argument has two premises and a conclusion.\n2. The first premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where P = Jeff played basketball and Q = Amy played tennis.\n3. The second premise states that Jeff did play basketball, which is the antecedent (P) of the first premise's conditional statement.\n4. The conclusion states that Amy played tennis, which is the consequent (Q) of the first premise's conditional statement.\n5. Logically, if the antecedent (P) is true and the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n6. In this argument, since both premises are true (Jeff did play basketball and the conditional statement is true), the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n7. Therefore, the form of this argument is logically valid because the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion according to the rules of logic.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n",
