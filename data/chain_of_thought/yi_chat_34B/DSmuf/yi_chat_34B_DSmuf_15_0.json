The first statement is \"Either the shoes must be lined up by the door or they are in the closet.\" This is a logical disjunction, meaning that one of two conditions must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door.\" This is a negation of the first part of the disjunction. Since we are told this is not the case, it means that the first part of the disjunction (the shoes being lined up by the door) cannot be true.\n\n3. If the first part of the disjunction is not true, then according to the law of excluded middle (which states that in a logical system with the law of non-contradiction, exactly one of two contradictory statements must be true), the second part of the disjunction must be true.\n\n4. The second part of the disjunction is \"The shoes are in the closet.\" Since we have established that the first part cannot be true",
