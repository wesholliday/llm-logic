We are given that \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" which means the first part of the original statement (Fido being in the garden) is false.\n3. If the first possibility is false, then we must consider the second possibility: \"Fido is inside.\"\n4. Since there are no other options presented, and both possibilities cannot be false simultaneously, if one is false, the other must be true.\n5. Therefore, since we have established that Fido cannot be in the garden (based on the information given), it follows that Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
