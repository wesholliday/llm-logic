The first statement provides two possibilities for where the milk could be: either it must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter. This is an \"either/or\" scenario.\n\n2. The second statement tells us that it is not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge. This means we can eliminate one of the two possibilities presented in the first statement.\n\n3. Since we know the milk cannot be chilling in the fridge, according to the second statement, the only remaining possibility is that the milk is on the counter.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer 'The milk is on the counter'.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Yes<|im_end|><|im_end|>\n",
