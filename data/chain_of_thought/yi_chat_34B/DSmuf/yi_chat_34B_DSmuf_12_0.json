The statement \"Either the jacket must be hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair\" tells us that there are only two possibilities for where the jacket can be: either in the closet or on the chair.\n\n2. The next statement, \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet,\" directly contradicts one of those possibilities. Since we cannot have both statements being true at the same time (because they exclude each other), we must choose which one is true.\n\n3. If it's not true that the jacket must be hanging in the closet, then by process of elimination, the only remaining possibility is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The jacket is draped over the chair.\"<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
