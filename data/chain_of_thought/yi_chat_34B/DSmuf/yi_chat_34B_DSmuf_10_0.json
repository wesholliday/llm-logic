When we negate a disjunction, we do not automatically know which part of the disjunction is true; we only know that one of them must be true.\n\n3. **Inference**: Since we have negated the first possibility (the sock not being under the bed) and we are dealing with an either-or statement where exactly one option must be true, we can infer that if the first option is not true, then the second option (the sock being in the laundry basket) must be",
