The statement \"Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack\" presents two possibilities for where the scarf could be.\n2. We are given that \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack,\" which means that the first possibility (the scarf being on the coat rack) is not true.\n3. Since there are only two possibilities presented and one of them has been eliminated, we can conclude that the other possibility must be true.\n4. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\"<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
