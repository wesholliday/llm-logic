The statement \"Either the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box\" tells us that there are two possibilities for where the toy could be: on the bookshelf or in the toy box.\n2. The next statement, \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" means that one of the two possibilities is ruled out. Since we can't be on the bookshelf, the only remaining possibility is that the toy is in the toy box.\n3. Therefore, based on these two pieces of information, we can infer that \"The toy is in the toy box.\"<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
