It does not exclude the possibility that it could be both, but since we have the second statement...\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\" This statement negates the idea that the watch *must* be on his wrist. It leaves open the possibility that the watch is either not on his wrist or it could be both on his wrist and charging on the dresser. However, since we know from the first statement that if it's not on his wrist, it must be charging on the dresser, and we have been told it's not on his wrist, then...\n\nWe can infer that \"The watch is charging on the dresser.\"<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Yes<|im_end|><|im_end|>\n",
