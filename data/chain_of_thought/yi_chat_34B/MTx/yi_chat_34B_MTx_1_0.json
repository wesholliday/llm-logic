To do this, we need to consider the validity of the original conditional A \u2192 B and the given information that B is false.\n\nIn a valid conditional statement, if the second part (B) is false, then the first part (A) cannot be true. This is because if A were true, it would make the entire conditional statement true, which contradicts our assumption that B is false.\n\nTherefore, based on the validity of the conditional and the given information about B, we can infer that",
