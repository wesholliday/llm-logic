To do this, we can use the principles of logic:\n\n- If a conditional statement is true and its antecedent (the part before 'then') is false, then the entire statement is true because an impossible condition cannot make a true statement false.\n- If a negative statement contradicts a conditional statement's consequent (the part after 'then'), then we can infer that the antecedent of the conditional must be false to avoid the contradiction.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- The conditional statement is \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint\".\n- The negative statement is \"The wug did not bim the zoint\".\n\nSince the negative statement contradicts the consequent of the conditional statement, we can infer that the antecedent (\"the",
