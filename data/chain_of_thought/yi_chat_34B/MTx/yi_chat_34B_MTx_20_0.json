In other words, if we know that the fleeg did not surn despite being bluttered, then the original conditional statement is false.\n\nSince the original conditional statement is false, we can infer that when the antecedent (\"The fleeg was bluttered\") is true, the consequent (\"It surned\") does not have to be true. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that \"The fleeg was not bluttered\" based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>",
