We are given two statements:\n   - If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled (conditional statement in the form of an if-then proposition).\n   - The sprocket was not daggled (negation of the second part of the conditional statement).\n\n2. In a valid argument from the conditional statement, if the second part is true (the sprocket was daggled), then the first part must also be true (the sprocket was cranked). This is because the conditional statement asserts that crankedness implies daggledness.\n\n3. However, since we are told that the sprocket was not daggled, we can conclude that the second part of the conditional is false.\n\n4. According to the rules of logic for a valid argument from a conditional statement, if the second part is false, then the first part cannot be inferred with certainty. It could be true or false, but we cannot know for sure based on the information provided.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the given statements and the rules of logic, we cannot infer that '",
