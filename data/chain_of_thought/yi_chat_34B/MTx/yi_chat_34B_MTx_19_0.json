To do this, we need to consider the truth value of A.\n\nIf B is false and A \u2192 B is a valid statement, then by the contrapositive rule (which states that if A \u2192 B is true, then \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA is also true), we can infer that \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA. Since we know B is false, we can conclude that \u00acA must be true as well.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the rules of logic, we can infer '",
