To do this, we need to consider the relationship between A and B in the conditional statement and the negation of B given as a fact.\n\nIf we know that B is false (the glip was not tragged), then according to the contrapositive rule, which states that if A \u2192 B is true, then \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA is also true, we can infer that if B is false, then A must be false as well.\n\nSo, given that \u00acB (the glip was not tragged) is true, we can conclude that",
