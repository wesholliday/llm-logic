To answer this, we need to consider the truth values of A and B:\n\n- If A is true, then according to our conditional statement (A \u2192 B), B should also be true. However, we know that B is false, which means there is a contradiction. This situation is known as a logical paradox or an inconsistency, and it cannot happen in classical logic. Therefore, if B is false, A must also be false.\n\n- Since B (the flug was zimmed) is false, and we",
