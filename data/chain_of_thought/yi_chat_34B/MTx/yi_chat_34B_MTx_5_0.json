To do this, we need to consider the validity of the original conditional A \u2192 B and the known truth value of B.\n\nIf B is false (as we know it is), then according to the contrapositive rule, which states that if A \u2192 B is true, then not(B) \u2192 not(A) is also true, we can infer that not(B) must imply not(A). However, since our original conditional was only given as A \u2192 B, without any information about its truth value",
