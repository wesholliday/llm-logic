To do this, we can use the logical principle of modus tollens, which allows us to deduce a negative conclusion if a positive statement is assumed and its consequence does not occur.\n\nApplying modus tollens:\n- If A (the splat was morphed) then B (the splat quanks).\n- Not B (the splat did not quank).\n\u2234 Not A (the splat was not morphed).\n\nTherefore, based on the provided statements and the application of modus tollens, we can infer that \"The splat was not mor",
