The book might not be a mystery novel.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if James wrote the book, it would necessarily be a mystery novel. However, statement 2 tells us that the book might not be a mystery novel. This creates a logical contradiction because if the book is not a mystery novel, then it cannot simultaneously be the case that if James wrote the book, it must be a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that since the book might not be a mystery novel (and thus, cannot be both written by James and not a mystery novel), it follows that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
