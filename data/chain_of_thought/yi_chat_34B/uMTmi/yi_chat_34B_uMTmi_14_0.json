This statement suggests a logical connection between the presence of the bear and the wolf. It implies that when the bear is in the cave, the wolf is necessarily in the den.\n\n2. The wolf might not have been in the den. This statement introduces an element of uncertainty about the wolf's location. It suggests that although the first statement indicates the wolf should be in the den if the bear is in the cave, there is a possibility that this is not the case.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively infer that the bear was not in the cave.
