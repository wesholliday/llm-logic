This is a conditional statement where taking a plane (Sam) is the antecedent and taking a train (Erin) is the consequent.\n\n2. Erin might not have taken a train. This suggests that there is a possibility that the second part of the conditional statement may not be true, even if the first part (Sam taking a plane) is true.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n- If Sam took a plane and we know that Erin might not have taken a train, then the original conditional statement does not hold true in all cases.\n\n- Since there is a possibility that Erin did not take a train, even if Sam took a plane, we cannot infer with certainty that Sam's taking a plane implies that Erin took a train.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively conclude that Sam did not take a plane. The only certain statement we can make is that if Sam took a plane and Erin also took a train, then the original conditional would be true. However, since we know that Erin might",
