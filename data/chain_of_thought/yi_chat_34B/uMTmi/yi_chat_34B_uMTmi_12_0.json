This is a conditional statement where \"Joe going to the park\" is the condition for \"Lucy going to the zoo.\"\n\n2. We also know that Lucy might not have gone to the zoo. Since this information contradicts the first statement (if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must go to the zoo), we need to consider both possibilities:\n   a. Either Joe did not go to the park, which would mean that the condition for Lucy going to the zoo is not met, and she might not have gone to the zoo as stated.\n   b. Or, Joe went to the park but for some reason unrelated to the conditional statement (which we don't know about), Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\n3. Since we are dealing with possibilities and there is a contradiction in the information provided, we cannot definitively infer that Joe did not go to the park. We can only say that if Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe might not have gone to the park, but we cannot rule out the possibility that",
