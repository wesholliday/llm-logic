We are also told that it's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand. This means that the statement \"The notebook is sitting on the nightstand\" is false.\n3. Since there are only two options provided, and one of them (the notebook being on the nightstand) has been eliminated as a possibility, we can conclude that the other option must be true.\n4. Therefore, since the notebook cannot be on the nightstand, it must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
