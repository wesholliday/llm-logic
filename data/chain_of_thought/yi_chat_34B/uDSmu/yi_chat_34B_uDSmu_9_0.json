The missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\n\nThe statement also tells us that it's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor. This means we can eliminate possibility 2. Since there are only two possibilities given, and one of them has been eliminated, we can conclude that the only remaining possibility is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]Yes<|im_end|><|im_end|>\n",
