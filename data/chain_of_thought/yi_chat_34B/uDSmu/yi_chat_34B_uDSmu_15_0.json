We are given two statements about the location of the shoes:\n   - The shoes are either in the closet or they must be lined up by the door.\n   - It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door.\n\n2. Since the second statement negates the possibility of the shoes being lined up by the door, we can eliminate that option.\n\n3. The first statement tells us that if the shoes are not lined up by the door, they must be in the closet (because it's an either/or situation).\n\n4. Since we have established that the shoes are not lined up by the door, according to the first statement, the only remaining option is that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
