This statement tells us that Fido's location can be determined to be either indoors or outdoors (in the garden), but not both simultaneously. It presents two possibilities for Fido's location.\n\n2. It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden. This second statement rules out one of the possibilities presented in the first statement.
