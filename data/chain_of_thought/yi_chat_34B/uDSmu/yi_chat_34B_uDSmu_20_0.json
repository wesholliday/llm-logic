We are also told that it is not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head. This means that the condition of them being on her head is excluded, leaving only one possibility.\n3. Since there are two options and one of them (the sunglasses being perched on her head) has been eliminated, we can conclude that the other option must be true by default.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
