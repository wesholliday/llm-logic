We are also told that it's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist. This means that the statement \"the watch is on his wrist\" is false.\n3. Since there are only two options provided, and one of them (the watch being on his wrist) has been confirmed as false, we can logically conclude that the other option must be true.\n4. Therefore, since the watch is not on his wrist, it must be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
