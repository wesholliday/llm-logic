The statement \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack\" tells us that there are only two possible locations for the scarf: either in the backpack or on the coat rack.\n\n2. The second part of the statement, \"Also, it's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack,\" means that one of the possibilities has been eliminated. Since the scarf cannot be on the coat rack, the only remaining option is that it must be stuffed in your backpack.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[SYS]The scarf is stuffed in your backpack.<|im_end|>\n",
