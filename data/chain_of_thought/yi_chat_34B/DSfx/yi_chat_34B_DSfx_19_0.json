It suggests that one of these conditions must be true.\n\n2. \"The smonk is not plagged.\" This statement denies the first possibility mentioned in the first statement. Since we know the smonk isn't plagged, according to the second statement, we can conclude that the only remaining option is for the smonk to be vreebled.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
