It implies that in any situation, the wug must be in one of these two states; it cannot be neither garpled nor sproinged.\n\n2. \"The wug is not garpled.\" This statement tells us that one of the possibilities mentioned in the first statement is not true for the wug: it is not garpled.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that since the wug is not garpled and there are only two possible states (garpled or sproinged), the wug must be in the other state, which is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
