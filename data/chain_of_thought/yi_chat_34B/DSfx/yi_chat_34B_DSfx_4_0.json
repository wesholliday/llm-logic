The statement \"Either the fribble is crinked or it is snurgled\" is a logical disjunction, meaning that one of two possibilities must be true.\n2. We are given that \"The fribble is not crinked\" which means that the first possibility (the fribble being crinked) is false.\n3. If the first possibility is false and we are dealing with an exclusive disjunction (which can be inferred from the context as there are only two options given), then the second possibility must be true.\n4. Therefore, since \"The fribble is not crinked\" and it cannot be both crinked and snurgled at the same time (due to the exclusive nature of the disjunction), we can infer that \"The fribble is snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
