It's an example of the logical principle known as the law of excluded middle.\n\n2. \"The flug is not zimmed.\" This statement tells us that one of the possibilities from the first statement is ruled out. Since we know it's not zimmed, the only remaining possibility is that it must be blummed.\n\nTherefore, based on the law of excluded middle and the information provided, we can infer:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
