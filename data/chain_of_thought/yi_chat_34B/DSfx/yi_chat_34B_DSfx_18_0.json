It implies that if the shank is not one of these states, then it must be in the other state.\n\n2. \"The shank is not nugged.\" This statement tells us that one of the two possibilities mentioned in the first statement is not true for the shank: it is not in the 'nugged' state.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can infer the following:\n\n- If the shank is not nugged, then according to the first statement, it must be plooked.\n\nTherefore, based on the logic provided by the statements and their implications, we can conclude that:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response. Thank you for your question. If you have any further questions or need assistance with anything else, please let me know!<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>",
