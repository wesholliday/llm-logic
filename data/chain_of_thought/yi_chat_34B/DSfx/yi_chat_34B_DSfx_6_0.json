It implies that if the grommet is not one of these states, then it must be in the other state.\n\n2. \"The grommet is not plopped.\" This statement tells us that the first possibility (plopped) is not true.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer:\n\n3. If the grommet is not plopped and there are only two possibilities (as stated in point 1), then it must be in the other possible state, which is:\n\nAnswer: yes sploffed.<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Explanation: Since we know that the grommet cannot be plopped and there are only two options given (plopped or sploffed), it logically follows that the grommet must be in the other state, which is sploffed.",
