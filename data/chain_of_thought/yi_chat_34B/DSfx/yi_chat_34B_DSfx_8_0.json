The statement \"Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked\" is a logical disjunction, meaning that only one of the two possibilities (daggled or cranked) can be true at any given time.\n\n2. We are also given the information that \"The sprocket is not daggled.\" This means that the first possibility in the disjunction (that it is daggled) is false.\n\n3. Since a logical disjunction must be true if at least one of its parts is true, and we have established that the first part is false, the only way for the entire disjunction to remain true is if the second part (\"it is cranked\") is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that \"The sprocket is cranked.\"<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
