It does not specify which one is true in any given situation.\n\n2. \"The fleeg is not surned.\" This provides additional information that rules out one of the possibilities mentioned in statement 1. Since the fleeg is not surned, the only remaining possibility is that it must be bluttered.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can infer:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RE",
