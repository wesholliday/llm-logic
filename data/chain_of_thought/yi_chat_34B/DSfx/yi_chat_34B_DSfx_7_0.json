It is an example of the law of excluded middle, which states that for any proposition, either it is true or its negation is true.\n\n2. \"The whiffle is not tinked.\" This statement denies the first possibility given in the first statement. Since we are told only one of the possibilities can be true at a time, and since we have established that the whiffle is not tinked (the first option), then by default the second option must be true.\n\n3. \"The whiffle is shanked.\" This is the second possibility from the original statement, which we are now inferring to be true because the first possibility has been negated.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the logical rules of inference, we can conclude that:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of Response. Thank you for your question. If you have any further questions or need assistance with anything",
