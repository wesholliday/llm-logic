In this case, either the flob is movated (condition 1), or it is skizzled (condition 2).\n\n2. \"The flob is not movated.\" This statement negates condition 1. If we know that condition 1 is false, then according to the law of excluded middle (in classical logic), the opposite of condition 1 must be true. The opposite of 'movated' in this context would be 'not movated'.\n\nHowever, there seems to be a contradiction here because we are told that the flob is not movated, which implies that it must be skizzled according to the law of excluded middle. But this contradicts the original statement that the flob is not movated or skizzled.\n\nTo resolve this contradiction, we need more information about the terms 'movated' and 'skizzled' and how they relate to each other.
