It does not specify which possibility is true at this point.\n\n2. \"The flugel is not zargled.\" This provides additional information that one of the possibilities from the first statement is false (the flugel not being zargled). Since there are only two options given, and we know one of them must be true, the other option (the flugel being blimmed) must be true by default.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Explanation:\n\nGiven the statement \"Either the flugel is zargled or it is blimmed,\" and the additional information that \"The flugel is not zargled,\" we can use a process of elimination to determine the state of the flugel",
