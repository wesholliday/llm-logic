It implies that there are only two possible states for the dreb: being spended or being vroombed.\n\n2. \"The dreb is not spended.\" This statement tells us that one of the possibilities mentioned in the first statement is not true for this particular situation: the dreb is not in the state of being spended.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that since the dreb is not spended and there are only two possible states for the dreb as per the first statement, the dreb must be in the other stated state, which is:\n\n3. \"The dreb is vroombed.\" This is a valid logical inference from the previous two statements. Since the dreb cannot be both spended and vroombed (due to the first statement) and it is not spended (as per the second statement), it must be vroombed.\n",
