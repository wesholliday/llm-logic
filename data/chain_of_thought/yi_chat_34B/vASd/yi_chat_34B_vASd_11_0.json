This suggests a direct relationship between sufficient sleep and lack of fatigue.\n2. The conclusion extends the premise by adding an additional factor: hard labor. It asserts that if you combine getting enough sleep with doing hard labor, you still won't be tired.\n3. To determine the validity of this argument, we need to consider whether the addition of hard labor to the premise (enough sleep) necessarily leads to the conclusion (not being tired).\n4. Logical validity is determined by the structure of the argument; if the premises are true and the logic is sound, then the conclusion must be true as well.\n5. In this case, the premise only guarantees that you won't be tired if you get enough sleep. It does not specify what other factors might affect your level of fatigue.\n6. The introduction of hard labor into the argument introduces a new variable that is not accounted for in the premise. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n7. Since the premise does not cover the combined effect of getting enough sleep and doing hard labor, the argument is not logically valid",
