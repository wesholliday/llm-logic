The proposed conclusion adds an additional condition to the premise - that the package was misrouted.\n3. To determine if the form of argument is logically valid, we need to ask ourselves if the truth of the premise (the package having shipped) guarantees the truth of the conclusion (the package arriving today, given it has shipped and was misrouted).\n4. Logical validity means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n5. In this case, the additional condition of being misrouted does not necessarily negate the original premise. The package could still potentially arrive today even if it was misrouted, as long as it has indeed shipped.\n6. Therefore, adding the condition of being misrouted to the premise does not automatically make the conclusion false, and thus the argument form is logically valid.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n",
