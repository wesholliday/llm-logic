            "content": "\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. The original premise states that if the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm. This establishes a direct relationship between the oven being on and the kitchen being warm.\n\n2. The conclusion adds an additional condition to the premise: not only is the oven on, but also the pilot light is out. It then asserts that in this situation, the kitchen would still be warm.\n\n3. Logical validity refers to the structure of the argument, not the truth or falsity of its premises or conclusions. An argument is valid if and only if it is impossible for all of its premises to be true and its conclusion false.\n\n4. In this case, if the oven is on (as per the premise) and the pilot light is out (as per the additional condition in the conclusion), then there is no reason to believe that the kitchen would not be warm, given that the original premise already established a direct relationship between the oven being on and the kitchen being warm.\n\n5. Therefore, it is logically valid for the argument to conclude that if the oven is on and the pilot light is out, the kitchen will be warm, because the additional condition does not contradict or negate",
