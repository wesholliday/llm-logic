The conclusion adds an additional condition to the premise - that the garage is flooding.\n3. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether adding the condition of a flooded garage changes the logical relationship between the car being in the garage and its safety.\n4. If the car's safety were guaranteed by simply being in the garage, then adding the condition of a flooded garage should not change the outcome (because the car is still \"in the garage\").\n5. However, common sense tells us that if the garage is flooding, the car's safety would be compromised, even though it is technically still \"in the garage.\"\n6. Therefore, the additional condition of a flooded garage negates the original premise and renders the conclusion false.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n\n",
