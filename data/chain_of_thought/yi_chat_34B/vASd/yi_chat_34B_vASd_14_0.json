            "content": "\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. The original premise states that if you study hard, you will pass the test. This suggests a direct cause-and-effect relationship between studying hard and passing the test.\n2. The conclusion adds an additional condition: the test being in Chinese. It implies that if you study hard and the test is in Chinese, you will still pass the test.\n3. To determine the validity of this argument, we need to consider whether the addition of the new premise (the test being in Chinese) logically follows from the original premise.\n4. There is no logical connection between studying hard and the language of the test. The original premise does not provide any information about the test's language or how it might affect the outcome.\n5. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid because it assumes a relationship where none has been established. The conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise provided.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n\n",
