            "content": "\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. The premise states that if you fill up the gas tank, the car will run. This suggests a direct cause-and-effect relationship between filling up the gas tank and the car running.\n2. The conclusion adds an additional condition to the premise - there is a hole in the gas tank. Logically, this additional information should not change the outcome of the premise since it does not directly contradict or negate the action of filling up the gas tank.\n3. If we consider the premise to be true (i.e., if you fill up the gas tank, the car will run), then adding an extra detail about a hole in the gas tank should not affect whether the car runs or not, as long as there is enough fuel to compensate for any potential leaks.\n4. Therefore, based on the given premise and the additional information in the conclusion, the argument form appears to be logically valid because it does not introduce any new conditions that would negate the initial premise.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
