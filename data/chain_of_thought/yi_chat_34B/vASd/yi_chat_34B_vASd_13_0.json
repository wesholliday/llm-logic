The argument starts with a premise that states \"If I exercise, I will lose weight.\" This premise suggests a direct relationship between exercising and losing weight.\n\n2. The conclusion expands on the premise by adding another factor: eating junk food. It asserts that if both conditions (exercising and eating junk food) are met, then the result (losing weight) will still occur.\n\n3. Logically, the argument is attempting to establish a chain of causation where exercise is one link and avoiding junk food is another, both leading to the outcome of losing weight.\n\n4. However, the premise only establishes that exercise alone leads to weight loss; it does not account for the effect of eating junk food in conjunction with exercise.\n\n5. The argument assumes that because exercise leads to weight loss, and because the person is also exercising, then the conclusion (losing weight) must be true.\n\n6. This line of reasoning is fallacious because it overlooks the fact that the premise does not cover the scenario where both exercise and junk food consumption occur simultaneously.\n\n7. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid because it does not provide a necessary connection between the",
