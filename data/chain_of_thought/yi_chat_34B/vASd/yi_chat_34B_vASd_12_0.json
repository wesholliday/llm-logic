            "content": "\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. The original premise states that if you finish your homework, you can play video games. This suggests a direct relationship between completing the homework and being able to play video games.\n2. The conclusion adds an additional condition: not only does the person need to finish their homework, but also their computer must not catch on fire.\n3. Logically, if we assume that the original premise is true (i.e., finishing homework leads to playing video games), then adding a new condition (the computer not catching on fire) should still maintain this relationship unless there's a specific reason why it wouldn't.\n4. There isn't any information provided that suggests the condition about the computer catching on fire would necessarily negate the original premise or conclusion.\n5. Therefore, based on the information given, the argument appears to be logically valid because it maintains the relationship between finishing homework and playing video games by adding a new but unrelated condition (the computer's status).<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n",
