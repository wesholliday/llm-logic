    "user_prompt": "Suppose that tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources. Forecasts indicate it\u2019s likely tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. These are the only major sources, so if solar power doesn\u2019t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn\u2019t, wind power will. Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?",

            "content": "[RESP]Let's break down the information given step by step:\n\n1. Tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources.\n2. Forecasts indicate that tidal power is likely to generate the most electricity this year.\n3. Solar power is expected to follow tidal power in terms of electricity generation.\n4. Wind power capacity is significantly behind tidal and solar power.\n5. If solar power doesn't generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn't, wind power will.\n6. Tidal power is likely to generate the most electricity, so solar power is unlikely to do so.\n\nGiven these points, we can infer:\n\n- Since tidal power is likely to generate the most electricity and solar power is unlikely to do so, it means that if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, then solar power must be generating the most.\n- If solar power isn't generating the most, by the given logic, wind power will be the one to generate the most electricity in that case.\n\nTherefore, it does follow that if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power is likely to do so.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer:",
