Economists project it's likely India's economy will grow the fastest this year, followed closely by China's, with Russia's growth rate lagging distantly behind. These are by far the biggest emerging economies, so if China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn\u2019t, Russia will be. Moreover, India's economy likely will grow the fastest of these three and hence China's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if India isn\u2019t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be?",

Economists project India's economy to grow the fastest among the three countries (India, China, and Russia) this year.\n2. If India is not the top-growing emerging economy, then according to the statement, \"if China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn\u2019t, Russia will be,\" we can infer that:\n   a. If India is not the fastest growing, and China is also not the fastest growing, then by default, Russia must be the fastest growing among these three countries.\n   b. Since it's stated that \"India's economy likely will grow the fastest of these three,\" this implies that China's growth rate will be lower than India's but could still be higher than Russia's.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude:\n\nAnswer: No, it does not follow that if India isn\u2019t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be. The statement suggests that if both India and China are not the fastest growing, then Russia must be; however, the information provided indicates that China's growth rate is expected to be lower than",
