    "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it\u2019s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be. Moreover, it\u2019s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",

It's likely that apples will be the top-selling fruit this year.\n3. If apples aren't the top seller, then it's likely that bananas will be, since they are followed closely by bananas.\n4. However, if bananas aren't the top seller (because apples are), then oranges must be the next most likely to be the top-selling fruit, given that they are distantly behind in sales but still among the top three.\n5. The statement suggests that since apples are likely to be the top seller and hence bananas won't be, it follows that if apples aren't the top seller, oranges will be.\n\nAnswer: Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
