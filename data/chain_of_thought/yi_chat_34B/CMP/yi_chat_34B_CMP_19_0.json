    "user_prompt": "Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don\u2019t increase the most, then if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won\u2019t increase the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?",

If home prices do not increase the most, and rents do not increase the most, then mortgage rates must increase the most, as these are the only major housing costs projected to rise substantially.\n3. Since rents are predicted to increase more than home prices, it is already established that home prices will not increase the most.\n4. Therefore, if rents do not increase the most, which would be the only other possibility besides home prices and mortgage rates, then by process of elimination, mortgage rates must increase the most.\n\nAnswer: Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
