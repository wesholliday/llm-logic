    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the stock market, real estate market, and bond market are the primary investment vehicles. According to financial advisors, the stock market likely will see the highest returns this year, followed by real estate, with bonds having significantly lower expected returns. These markets offer the best investment options, so if real estate doesn\u2019t have the highest returns, then if stocks don\u2019t, bonds will. Moreover, stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if stocks don\u2019t have the highest returns, bonds will?",

Real estate is expected to have lower returns than the stock market but higher than bonds.\n3. Bonds are expected to have significantly lower returns compared to both stocks and real estate.\n4. Financial advisors suggest that these markets offer the best investment options.\n5. If real estate doesn't have the highest returns, then if stocks don't, bonds will.\n6. Stocks likely will have the highest returns, so real estate likely won't.\n\nFrom the above points, we can infer:\n\n- The stock market is expected to perform better than real estate and bonds.\n- Real estate is expected to perform better than bonds but not as well as stocks.\n- Bonds are expected to perform the worst among the three.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"if real estate doesn't have the highest returns, then if stocks don't, bonds will.\" This statement implies that if real estate is not the best performer, and stocks are also not the best performer, then by default, bonds must be the best",
