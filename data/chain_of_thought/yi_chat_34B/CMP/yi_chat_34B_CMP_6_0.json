    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, and Beyonce have the top-selling albums this year. Industry experts project it's likely Taylor Swift's album will sell the most copies, followed closely by Bad Bunny's, with Beyonce's album far behind. These are the only top-sellers, so if Bad Bunny\u2019s album doesn\u2019t sell the most copies, then if Taylor Swift\u2019s doesn\u2019t, Beyonce\u2019s will. Moreover, Taylor Swift\u2019s likely will sell the most and hence Bad Bunny's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will?",

If Bad Bunny's album does not sell the most copies, then it is likely that Taylor Swift's will, because Beyonce's album is far behind in sales.\n3. Since we are told that Taylor Swift's album is likely to sell the most, and there are no other top-selling albums mentioned, it implies that Bad Bunny's album is not expected to sell more than Taylor Swift's.\n4. Therefore, if Taylor Swift's album does not sell the most copies, it must be because either Beyonce's or Bad Bunny's album has surpassed it in sales.\n5. Given that Beyonce's album is far behind, it is less likely for Beyonce's album to suddenly surpass both Taylor Swift's and Bad Bunny's albums in sales.\n6. Thus, if Taylor Swift's album does not sell the most copies, it is more likely that Bad Bunny's will, since Bad Bunny's album is expected to be second in sales, with",
