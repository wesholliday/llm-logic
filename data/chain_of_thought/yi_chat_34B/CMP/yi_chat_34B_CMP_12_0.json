Publishing data indicates thrillers will likely be the #1 genre this year, followed closely by romances, with mysteries far behind. These genres lead the market, so if romances aren\u2019t #1, then if thrillers aren\u2019t, mysteries will be. Moreover, thrillers likely will lead sales and hence romances likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if thrillers aren\u2019t #1, mysteries will be?",

Publishing data indicates that thrillers will likely be the #1 genre this year.\n3. Romances follow closely behind thrillers in terms of sales.\n4. Mysteries are far behind the other two genres in terms of sales.\n5. Since these three genres lead the market, if romances aren't #1, and thrillers aren't #1, then mysteries must be #1.\n6. Thrillers are likely to lead sales, which implies that romances are not likely to be #1.\n\nGiven this information, we can conclude that it is indeed likely that if thrillers aren't #1, mysteries will be. The reason for this is that there are only three major genres competing for the top spot, and since thrillers are likely to be #1 and romances are not, the only remaining option for the second place (which could potentially become #1 if thrillers are out of the running) is mysteries.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP",
