    "user_prompt": "Suppose that pizza, burgers, and tacos are the most frequently ordered takeout foods. According to restaurant data, pizza likely will be the top takeout item ordered, followed by burgers, with tacos ordered much less frequently. These foods lead takeout orders, so if burgers aren\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn\u2019t, tacos will be. Moreover, pizza likely will lead takeout orders and hence burgers likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if pizza isn\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be?",

It also states that if burgers aren't the top takeout item ordered, and since pizza likely won't be either (because it's stated to be the most frequent), then tacos must be.\n3. The logic here is that there are only three options: pizza, burgers, and tacos. If the two most popular choices (pizza and burgers) aren't the top item ordered, then by default, the third option (tacos) must be.\n\nGiven this reasoning, it does follow that if pizza isn't the top takeout item ordered, tacos will likely be, because there are no other options mentioned as being more popular than tacos in the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
