    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower.\n3. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will.\n4. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t.\n\nFrom point 2, we know that Tennessee is expected to add the most jobs, followed by Georgia, with Missouri's growth lower than both. Point 3 suggests a logical sequence: if Georgia doesn't add the most jobs, and Tennessee doesn't either, then Missouri must be the one to do so because these are the three states with the strongest job growth.\n\nPoint 4 reinforces the idea that Tennessee is likely to add the most jobs, which implies that Georgia is not likely to add the most jobs. However, point 3 does not specify what happens if both Tennessee and Georgia fail to add the most jobs; it only establishes a sequence of events",
