    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it\u2019s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn\u2019t get the offer, then if Priya doesn\u2019t, Diego will. Moreover, it\u2019s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn\u2019t get the offer, Diego will?",

If Priya doesn't get the offer, Julian is next in line.\n3. If neither Priya nor Julian gets the offer, Diego will.\n4. It's likely that Priya will get the offer and therefore unlikely that Julian will.\n\nNow let's consider the question: Is it likely that if Priya doesn't get the offer, Diego will?\n\nBased on the information provided, we can infer the following probabilities:\n\n- P(Priya offered) > P(Julian offered) > P(Diego offered)\n- If Priya is not offered the position, Julian is more likely to be offered than Diego.\n- The likelihood of Priya being offered the role reduces the likelihood of Julian being offered the role.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer from this information that if Priya doesn't get the offer, Diego will. The hiring manager's perception of likelihood does not necessarily translate into a strict order of probability. There could be other factors at play that we are not",
