    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Spain, Brazil, and England have the best chances to win the World Cup. Based on betting odds, it is most likely Spain will win, followed closely by Brazil, with England having much lower odds. These teams have the only realistic chances, so if Brazil doesn\u2019t win, then if Spain doesn\u2019t win, England will win. Moreover, it is likely Spain will win and hence that Brazil won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Spain doesn\u2019t win, England will?",

If Brazil doesn't win, and Spain doesn't win, then it is implied that England will win since these are the only realistic contenders.\n3. We are also told that it is likely Spain will win, which means Brazil is less likely to win due to the betting odds.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude:\n\n- It is likely that Spain will win.\n- If Spain doesn't win, then Brazil not winning becomes more likely (since Spain is now the only other realistic contender).\n- Since it is implied that if Brazil doesn't win and Spain doesn't win, England will win, and we know it's likely that Spain won't win, it follows that it is also likely that England will win in this scenario.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Step by step reasoning:\n\n1.
