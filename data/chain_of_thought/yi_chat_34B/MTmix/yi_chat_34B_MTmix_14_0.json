If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged.\n2. The clug might not have been snugged.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can see that if the clug were fleeked, it would necessarily be snugged. However, statement 2 tells us that the clug might not have been snugged. This creates a logical tension because if the clug was fleeked, it should have been snugged according to statement 1, but statement 2 suggests that it might not have been snugged after all.\n\nSince we are given that the clug might not have been snugged, and if it were fleeked, it would have to be snugged, we can infer that the clug must not have been fleeked. This is because the only way for the clug to not be snugged while still satisfying statement 1 is for the clug to not be fleeked in the first place.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n",
