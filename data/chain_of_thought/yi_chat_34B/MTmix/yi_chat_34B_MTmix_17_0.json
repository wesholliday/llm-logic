However, the second statement tells us that this might not be the case\u2014the flob might not have movated despite being skizzled. This creates a potential contradiction with the first statement.\n\n- If the flob did not movate (as per the second statement), then according to the first statement, it must not have been skizzled. Because if it had been skizzled, it would have necessarily movated, and we know it didn't.\n\nTherefore, based on",
