It only tells us that even if the sneg were crampled, it may not have led to the sneg sproting the frink.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively infer \"The sneg was not crampled\" because the second statement does not provide enough information about the condition (whether the sneg was crampled), only about a possible consequence (sproting the frink). The fact that the sneg might not have sproted the frink does not necessarily mean that it wasn't crampled; it could still have been",
