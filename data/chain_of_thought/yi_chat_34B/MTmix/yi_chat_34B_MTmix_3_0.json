We are asked to infer whether \"The splat was not morphed\" from these two statements.\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'The splat was not morphed', we need to consider the implications of the first statement in relation to the second. If the splat was indeed morphed, according to the first statement, it would have quanked. However, the second statement tells us that the splat might not have quanked, which seems to contradict the first statement.\n\nSince we are told that the splat might not have quanked, and if we assume that the first statement is true (that morphing leads to quanking)",
