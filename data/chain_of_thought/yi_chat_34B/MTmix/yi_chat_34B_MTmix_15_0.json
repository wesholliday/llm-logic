It's symbolically represented as:\n   If V (vroombed), then S (spended).\n\n2. \"The dreb might not have been spened.\" This tells us that the second part of the conditional statement may not be true. In other words, even if the dreb was vroombed, it might not have been spened. Symbolically:\n   V (vroombed) might not imply S (spended).\n\nNow, let's consider what we can infer from these two statements:\n\n- If the dreb was vroombed and we know that if it's vroombed, it must be spened, but we also know that it might not have been spened, then there is a contradiction. This means that our initial assumption (that the dreb was vroombed) cannot",
