The first statement is \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger must have been smoogled.\" This is a conditional statement where 'the zinger being fraggled' is the antecedent (A) and 'the zinger being smoogled' is the consequent (B). In symbolic form, this can be written as A \u2192 B.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The zinger might not have been smoogled.\" This suggests that B may not be true.\n\n3. To infer 'The zinger was not fraggled' (\u00acA) from the given statements, we would need to establish that if B is false, then A must also be false. In other words, we would need to know that the conditional statement A \u2192 B is logically equivalent to its contrapositive, which is \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA.\n\n4. However, without additional information or a specific rule that states that this contrapositive holds true in this context, we cannot directly infer",
