It leaves open the possibility that the flug could have been zimmed or not.\n\nNow, let's consider what we can infer from these statements:\n\n- If the first statement is true (the conditional) and the second statement is true (the possibility that the flug might not have been zimmed), then we have a contradiction because the first statement implies that if the flug was blummed, it must have been zimmed, but the second statement suggests it might not have been zimmed.\n\n- Since both statements cannot be true at the same time without creating a logical contradiction, we must conclude",
