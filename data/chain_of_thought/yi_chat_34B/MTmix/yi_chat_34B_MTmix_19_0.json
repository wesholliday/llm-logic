However, since the second statement suggests that the smonk might not have plagged, this creates a contradiction with the first statement.\n\n- Therefore, if we accept both statements as possibilities, we must conclude that either the smonk was not vreebled (which is consistent with it not having plagued), or the conditional statement \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged\" is not accurate.\n\nBased on",
