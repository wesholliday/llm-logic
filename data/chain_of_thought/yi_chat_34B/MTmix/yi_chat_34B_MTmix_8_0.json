It's represented as A \u2192 B, where A is cranking the sprocket and B is daggling the sprocket.\n\n2. \"The sprocket might not have been daggled.\" This statement suggests that B (daggling the sprocket) may not have happened.\n\nNow, we're asked if we can infer \"The sprocket was not cranked\" from these two statements. To infer this, we would need to use the contrapositive of the first statement, which is: If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked (not A \u2192 not B).\n\nHowever, we have a problem here. The second statement only tells us that the sprocket might not have been daggled, but it does not definitively say that it wasn",
