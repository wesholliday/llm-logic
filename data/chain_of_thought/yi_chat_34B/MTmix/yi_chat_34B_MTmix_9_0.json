If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished.\n2. The twonk might not have been varnished.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the twonk was indeed plinked, it would be a necessary consequence that it was also varnished. However, statement 2 tells us that there is a possibility that the twonk was not varnished.\n\nNow, let's consider what this means for our inference:\n\n- If the twonk was plinked (according to statement 1), it would have been varnished.\n- But we are told that the twonk might not have been varnished (statement 2).\n\nSince these two statements are contradictory (if the twonk were plinked, it would be varnished, but it might not be varnished), we can conclude that our initial assumption\u2014that the twonk was plinked\u2014must be false.
