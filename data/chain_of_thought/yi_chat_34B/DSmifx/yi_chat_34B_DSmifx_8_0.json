It implies that if the sprocket isn't daggled, then it must be cranked, and vice versa.\n\n2. \"The sprocket might not be daggled.\" This statement suggests that while there is a possibility that the sprocket is not daggled, it does not provide any information about whether it is cranked or not. It simply leaves open the option that the sprocket could be in either state (daggled or cranked).\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively infer that \"The sprocket is cranked\" because the second statement only tells us that daggling might not occur, but it does not confirm whether the sprocket is actually cranked. There is still a possibility that the sprocket is neither daggled nor cranked, or that it is in some other state not mentioned in the",
