The wug can either be garpled or it is sproinged.\n\n2. \"The wug might not be garpled.\" This suggests that the second possibility in the disjunction (it is sproinged) could be true if the first possibility (it is garpled) is not.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that since the wug might not be garpled, the only other option left to satisfy the original statement is that it must be sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
