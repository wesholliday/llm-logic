There are no other options given.\n\n2. \"The grommet might not be plopped.\" This suggests that one of the potential outcomes (plopping) may not occur, leaving us with the second possibility as the only option if the first is not true.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer:\n\n- If the grommet is not plopped, then it must be sploffed because there are no other options given.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, when we know that the grommet might not be plopped, we can conclude that \"The grommet is sploffed\" must be true.<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Explanation:\n\nGiven the statement \"Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed,",
