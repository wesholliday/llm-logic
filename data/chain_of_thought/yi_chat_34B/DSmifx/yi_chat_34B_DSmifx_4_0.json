It implies that if the fribble is not one, it must be the other.\n\n2. \"The fribble might not be crinked.\" This suggests that there is a possibility that the fribble is not in the crinked state.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that since the fribble might not be crinked (and it must be either crinked or snurgled), then it must be in the snurgled state.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
