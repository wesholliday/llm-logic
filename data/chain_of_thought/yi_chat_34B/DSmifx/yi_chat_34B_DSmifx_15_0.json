It either gets spent, or it is vroombed.\n\n2. \"The dreb might not be spended.\" This suggests that there is a possibility that the dreb does not get spent, which means we cannot eliminate the first option from consideration.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can conclude that if the dreb is not spent, then it must be vroombed, because the statement says \"either ... or\" and since one option (being spent) is not certain, the other option (being vroombed) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response.
