There are no other options given.\n\n2. \"The fleeg might not be surned.\" This suggests that option A (the fleeg being surned) may not be true. If we consider the two possibilities from statement 1, and eliminate one of them based on this new information, then the only remaining possibility is option B: the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided statements, we can infer that \"The fleeg is bluttered.\"<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Explanation:\n\nGiven the statement \"Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered,\" and the additional information that \"The fleeg might not be surned,\" we can infer that if option A (the fleeg being surned) is not true",
