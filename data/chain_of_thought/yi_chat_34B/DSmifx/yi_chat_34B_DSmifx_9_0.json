It implies that one of these conditions must be true, but not both.\n\n2. \"The twonk might not be plinked.\" This statement suggests that while being plinked is a possibility, it might not actually be the case. In other words, there is a chance that the twonk is not in the plinked state.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that if the twonk is not plinked (which is a possibility according to the second statement), then by process of elimination, it must be varnished, because the first statement tells us that exactly one of the conditions must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response. Thank you for your question. If you have any further questions or need assistance with anything else, please let me know!<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>",
