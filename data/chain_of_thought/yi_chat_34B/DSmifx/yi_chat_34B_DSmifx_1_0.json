It tells us that if the flugel isn't zargled, then it must be blimmed, and vice versa.\n\n2. \"The flugel might not be zargled.\"\n   This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the flugel is not zargled. However, it does not provide any information about whether it is blimmed or not.\n\nGiven these statements alone, we cannot definitively infer that \"The flugel is blimmed.\" The second statement only tells us that the flugel might not be zargled, but it does not confirm that it is blimmed. There could be other possibilities as well.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RE",
