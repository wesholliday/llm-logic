It implies that one of these conditions must be true, but not necessarily both.\n\n2. \"The flug might not be zimmed.\" This suggests that the first possibility (the flug being zimmed) may not be true. If we consider this in conjunction with the first statement, it means that if the flug is not zimmed, then the second possibility must be true: the flug is blummed.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can infer that since the flug might not be zimmed (which is consistent with the first statement), it must be blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"Either the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed\" presents two mutually exclusive options for the state of the flug.
