There is a possibility that it remains uncrinkled.\n\n2. \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked.\" This statement presents two options: The fribble is either snurgled (option A), or it must be crinked (option B). It implies that one of these conditions has to be true.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively infer \"The fribble is snurgled\" because the first statement allows for the possibility that the fribble might not be crinked, and the second statement only tells us that if it's not snurgled, it must be crinked. However, since we know from the first statement that it might not be crinked, we cannot conclude with certainty that it is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Explanation:\n\nThe provided statements give us",
