It leaves open the possibility that it could have been quanked, but also allows for the scenario where it hasn't.\n\n2. \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked.\" This statement presents a logical disjunction: either the splat has undergone morphing, or it must be quanked (or both could be true). It does not specify which of these two options is more likely or what evidence supports one over the other.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively infer that \"The splat is morphed\" because the second statement allows for the possibility that the splat might just need to be quanked. The word \"morphed\" in the second statement could imply that morphing has already occurred, but without further information or context, we cannot be sure whether the splat has been morphed or if it simply needs to be quanked.\n\nTherefore, based on the",
