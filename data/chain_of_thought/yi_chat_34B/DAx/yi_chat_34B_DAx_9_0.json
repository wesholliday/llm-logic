The contrapositive of A \u2192 B is ~B \u2192 ~A, where '~' represents negation. This means that if we can show that B (the twonk was varnished) is true, then we can conclude that A (the twonk was plinked) must also be true, which contradicts our initial information about A being false.\n\nHowever, since we only know that A is false and not the truth value of B, we cannot directly infer the truth value of B from the information provided.",
