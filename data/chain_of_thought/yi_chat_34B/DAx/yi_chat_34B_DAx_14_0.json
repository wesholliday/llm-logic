To do this, we need to consider the relationship between the truth values of A and B in a conditional statement.\n\nIn classical logic, if the condition (A) is false, then the entire conditional statement (A \u2192 B) is considered true regardless of the truth value of B. This is because when the condition is false, the implication is always met; it doesn't matter whether B is true or false since A is not true to begin with.\n\nTherefore, based",
