This is because the conditional statement A \u2192 B only tells us that if A is true, then B must also be true; it does not tell us what happens when A is false (which is the case here since we have \u00acA).\n- To infer \u00acB from A \u2192 B and \u00acA, we would need an additional piece of information:",
