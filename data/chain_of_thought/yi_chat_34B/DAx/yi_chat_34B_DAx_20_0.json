This is because when the condition (A) is not met, the consequent (B) may or may not be true independently.\n\n- To conclude that \"The fleeg did not surn\" (\u00acB), we would need additional information that specifically states that if A does not happen, then B also does not happen. This would be represented as \u00acA \u2192 \u00acB.\n\nSince we do not have such a statement, we cannot definitively infer \"The fleeg did not surn",
