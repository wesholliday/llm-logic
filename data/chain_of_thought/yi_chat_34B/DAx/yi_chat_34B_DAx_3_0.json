In other words, if A is true, then B must also be true.\n\n2. \"The splat was not morphed.\" This statement tells us that A (the splat being morphed) is false.\n\nNow, we are asked to infer whether 'The splat did not quank' can be concluded from the given information. To answer this, we need to consider the relationship between A and B when A is false.\n\nSince A is false, according to the conditional statement A \u2192 B, B does not have to be true just because A is false. In other words, the fact that 'The splat was not morphed' does not necessarily mean that 'The splat did not quank'. The truth value of B (whether the splat quanked or not) is not determined by the truth value of A alone.\n",
