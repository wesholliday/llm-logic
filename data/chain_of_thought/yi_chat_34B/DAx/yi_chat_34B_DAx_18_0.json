It means that if the condition (the shank being plooked) is true, then the result (the shank being nugged) must also be true. This can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"The shank was plooked\" and Q is \"The shank was nugged.\"\n\n2. \"The shank was not plooked\" provides us with information about the condition (P) being false.\n\nNow, we can use the principle of explosion to determine whether the result (Q) must also be false if the condition (P) is false. According to this principle, from a false premise, any conclusion can be drawn. Since we know that P is false, we cannot directly conclude that Q must also be false based on the given information alone.\n\nHowever, we can say that if P \u2192 Q is true and P is false, then Q could be either true or false. The only time we can definitively say that Q is false is when P \u2192 Q is",
