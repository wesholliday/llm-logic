This means that if the first part (the flug being blummed) is true, then the second part (the flug being zimmed) must also be true. However, this does not tell us anything about what happens when the flug is not blummed.\n\n2. \"The flug was not blummed\" tells us that the first part of the implication is false. When the antecedent (the part before 'then') is false, an implication is considered vacuously true. This means that even though we don't know if the flug was zimmed or not, we can still say that the implication \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed\" holds true because the condition it depends on (the flug being blummed) is false.\n\nGiven these two statements alone, we cannot infer anything about whether the flug was zimmed or not. The second statement only tells us that the flug was not blummed,",
