To do this, we need to consider the logical implications of the conditional statement and the negated antecedent.\n\nIn a conditional statement A \u2192 B, if the antecedent A is false (as in \u00acA), then the entire conditional statement is considered true regardless of the truth value of B. This is because when A is false, the condition for B to follow never occurs, so we cannot conclude anything about B's status.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot",
