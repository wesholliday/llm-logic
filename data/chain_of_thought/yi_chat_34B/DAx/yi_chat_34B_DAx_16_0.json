To do this, we need to consider the logical relationship between the antecedent and the consequent in a conditional statement.\n\nIn classical logic, if the antecedent (A) is false, then the entire conditional statement (A \u2192 B) is considered true regardless of the truth value of B. This is because when A is false, the condition for B to be true (as a result of A being true) never has to be met.\n\nSince",
