This can be represented as \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA.\n\nNow, according to the rules of logic, if A \u2192 B is true, then its contrapositive \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA is also true. This is because they are logically equivalent and both cannot be false at the same time. If one is true, the other must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged,\" we can infer that \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\"<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]",
