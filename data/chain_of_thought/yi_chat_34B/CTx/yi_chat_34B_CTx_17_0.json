The original statement is \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"if P, then Q,\" where 'P' is 'the flob was skizzled' and 'Q' is 'the flob movated.'\n\n2. The inference being proposed is \"If the flob did not movated, then the flob was not skizzled.\" This is also a conditional statement, but it's the contrapositive of the original statement. In other words, it reverses both parts of the condition (from 'was skizzled' to 'was not skizzled') and the consequence (from 'movated' to 'did not movate').\n\n3. To determine if the inference is valid, we need to consider the truth values of P and Q in relation to each other. If the original statement is true, then whenever 'P' is true, 'Q' must also be true (and vice versa).\n\n4. The contrapositive states that when 'Q' is false,",
