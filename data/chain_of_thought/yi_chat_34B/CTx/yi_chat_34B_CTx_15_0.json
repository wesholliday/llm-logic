In other words, if we can show that if the dreb was not spended, then it must not have been vroombed, we have established the validity of the original statement through its contrapositive.\n\nHowever, the problem with the given statement is that it does not provide enough information to determine the truth value of A or B independently. We do not know whether the dreb was spended under any other circumstances than being vroombed, nor do we know if there are situations where a dreb could be vroombed without being spended.\n\nWithout additional context or information about the relationship between \"vroombing\" and \"spending\" a dreb, we cannot definitively infer that \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed.\" The truth of this inference would depend on",
