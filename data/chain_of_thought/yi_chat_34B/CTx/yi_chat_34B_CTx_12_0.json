In other words, if we negate both parts of the conditional, we get \"If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped.\"\n\nNow, according to the law of contraposition in logic, if a conditional statement is true, its contrapositive will also be true. Since we are given the original statement as true (the smip being shripped implies that it lupped the zoint), we can infer that its contrapositive is also true: \"If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped.\"\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response. Thank you for your question. If you have any further questions or need",
