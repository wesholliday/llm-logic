In other words, if we can show that \"If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged,\" it would be equivalent to the original statement because of the contrapositive theorem, which states that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.\n\nHowever, without additional information or context about the relationship between being slogged and being tragged, we cannot directly infer the converse (not A \u2192 not B) from the given statement A \u2192 B. The relationship could be many-to-one, one-to-many, or some other pattern that does not allow us to conclude definitively that if a glip was not tragged, it must also have been not slogged.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer \"If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was",
