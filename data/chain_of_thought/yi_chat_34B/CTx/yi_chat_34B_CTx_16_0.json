This means that if one is true, the other must also be true, and vice versa. Therefore, based on the original statement \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink,\" we can infer \"If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]",
