According to the law of contraposition in logic, if a conditional statement is true, its contrapositive will also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement and the law of contraposition, we can infer that \"If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked.\"<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n",
