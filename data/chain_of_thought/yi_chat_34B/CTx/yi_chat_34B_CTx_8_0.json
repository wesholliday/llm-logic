It only tells us that if the sprocket was cranked, it would be daggled. It does not necessarily mean that if the sprocket is not daggled, then it was not cranked. There could be other reasons for the sprocket not to be daggled, such as being malfunctioning or simply not having been used in the first place.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided by the original statement, we cannot infer",
