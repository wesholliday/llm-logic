In other words, if we want to infer \"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled,\" we need to find the contrapositive of the given statement.\n\nThe contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement because they both have the same truth table: If A \u2192 B is true, then not B \u2192 not A is also true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical equivalence of the contrapositive, we can infer that \"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled.\"<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END",
