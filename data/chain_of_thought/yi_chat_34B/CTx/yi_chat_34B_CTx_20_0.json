This would be a contrapositive of the original conditional, which is logically equivalent to A \u2192 B. The contrapositive is represented as \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA.\n\nTo infer the contrapositive, we need to know that the original statement is true. If it's true, then the contrapositive will also be true because of the law of contraposition in logic, which states that if A \u2192 B is true, then so is \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA.\n\nHowever, without additional information confirming the truth of the original statement (\"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\"), we cannot definitively infer the truth of its contrapositive. We can only say that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive",
