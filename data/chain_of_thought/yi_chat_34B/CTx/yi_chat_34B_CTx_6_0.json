This means that if we can infer that \"If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed\" is true, then the original statement must also be true.\n\nHowever, to directly answer the question posed: No, we cannot infer \"If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed\" from",
