In other words, if we want to infer \"If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled,\" we need to find the contrapositive of the given statement.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if one form is true, so is the other. Therefore, we can infer \"If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled\" from the given statement because they are logically equivalent through the contrapositive rule.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response. Thank you for your question. If you have any further questions or need assistance with anything else, please let me know!<|im_end|>\n",
