The contrapositive of A \u2192 B is \"If not B, then not A\" (\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA).\n\nTo determine if we can infer the proposed inference, we need to ask ourselves: If the whiffle did not tink (\u00acB), does that necessarily mean that the whiffle was not shanked (\u00acA)? The answer is no, because there could be other reasons why the whiffle might not have tinked. For example, it might not have been hit at all, or it might have been hit in such a way that it made a different sound than tinking. Therefore",
