            "content": "[RESP]Let's analyze the statement \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\" This is a conditional statement of the form A \u2192 B, where A represents \"the flugel was blimmed\" and B represents \"the flugel was zargled.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of this statement would be not B \u2192 not A. In other words, if we negate both parts of the original conditional, we get \"If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\nNow, according to the law of contraposition in logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if one is true, so is the other, and vice versa. Therefore, based on the truth of \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled,\" we can infer that \"If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]End of response. Thank you for your question",
