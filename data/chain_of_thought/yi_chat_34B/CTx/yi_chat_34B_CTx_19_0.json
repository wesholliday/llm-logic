In other words, it reverses the condition and the result.\n\nNow, we know that a conditional statement is true if its contrapositive is true. This is because the truth table for conditionals shows that the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. If one is true, the other must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical equivalence of a conditional and its contrapositive, we can infer:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP",
