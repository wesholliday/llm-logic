In other words, if we want to infer \"If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed,\" we need to find the contrapositive of the given statement.\n\nThe contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement because they both have the same truth table: If A \u2192 B is true, then not B \u2192 not A is also true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical equivalence of the contrapositive, we can infer \"If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed\" from the original statement \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\"<|im_end|>\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>",
