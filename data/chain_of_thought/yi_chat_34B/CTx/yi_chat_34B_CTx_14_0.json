The contrapositive flips both the hypothesis and the conclusion and negates them.\n\nHowever, the converse (Not(Snugged) -> Not(Fleeked)) is not the same as the contrapositive (Not(Fleeked) -> Not(Snugged)). The converse simply reverses the order of the original statement without changing the truth values, which does not necessarily preserve the logical relationship between the hypothesis and conclusion.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged,\" we cannot infer \"If the clug did not snugged",
