The original statement says that if the plink has morphed, it will tizzle. This is a conditional statement where 'plink morphing' is the condition (antecedent) and 'tizzling' is the result (consequent).\n\n2. We are asked to infer whether if the plink has morphed *and* it was misglommed, then it will tizzle. This new statement adds an additional condition: 'misglommed.'\n\n3. In logic, adding more conditions to a conditional statement does not necessarily change the validity of the inference, as long as all the added conditions are true. If something is both morphed and misglommed, it still meets the original condition of being morphed.\n\n4. Therefore, since 'plink morphing' is the only condition necessary for 'tizz",
