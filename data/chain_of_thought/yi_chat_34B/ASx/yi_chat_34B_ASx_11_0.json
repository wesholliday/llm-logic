The original statement is an if-then proposition, which means that if the condition (the zibble being zapped) is true, then the consequence (the glorp zooning) must also be true. This is a valid logical relationship.\n\n2. The proposed inference adds an additional condition to the original statement: not only should the zibble be zapped, but the quib must also be squinked.\n\n3. There is no information provided about how these two actions (zapping the zibble and squinking the quib) are related or whether they have any impact on each other. The original statement does not specify that the glorp's zooning depends on multiple conditions, only one: the zibble being zapped.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer that if the zibble",
