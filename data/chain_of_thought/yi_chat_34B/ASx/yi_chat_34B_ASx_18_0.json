Since the original statement does not provide any specific details about other factors that might affect the zonk's behavior, we cannot definitively say that adding an additional action (blorping) will necessarily lead to the same outcome.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided by the original statement, we cannot infer with certainty that \"If the zonk is twiddled and it is blorped, then it will pluzzle.\"<|im_end|>",
