There is no information provided about how the flooping of the snarp might change or affect the relationship between the fribble and being flugged.\n\nWithout any additional context or information, we cannot definitively say that if the snarp is flooping, it will necessarily result in the fribble being flugged. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer the extended statement",
