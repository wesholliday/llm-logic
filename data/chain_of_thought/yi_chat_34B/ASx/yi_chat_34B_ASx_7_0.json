The antecedent (the part before the 'if') is 'The tizzer is on.'\n2. The consequent (the part after the 'then') is 'The goom is snurpled.'\n\nNow, let's consider the proposed inference:\n\n- The antecedent of the inferred statement would be 'The tizzer is on and the plink light is out.'\n- The consequent of the inferred statement would be 'The goom is snurpled.'\n\nTo make this inference, we would need to determine if there is a relationship between the presence of the tizzer being on and the state of the plink light that would affect whether or not the goom is snurpled. However, the original statement provides no information about how the plink light might influence the relationship between the tizzer",
