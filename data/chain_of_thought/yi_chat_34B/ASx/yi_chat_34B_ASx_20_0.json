The original statement: 'If the plim is grobbled, then the whiffle will sploosh' (P \u2192 W).\n2. The proposed inference: 'If the plim is grobbled and the drazzle is drooped, then the whiffle will sploosh' (P \u2227 D \u2192 W).\n\nThe original statement establishes a conditional relationship between two events: if P (the plim is grobbled) is true, then W (the whiffle will sploosh) is also true. However, it does not specify anything about another condition, D (the drazzle is drooped).\n\nTo infer the proposed statement, we would need to establish that the presence of an additional condition (D) does not change the outcome of the original conditional relationship. In other words, we would need to know",
