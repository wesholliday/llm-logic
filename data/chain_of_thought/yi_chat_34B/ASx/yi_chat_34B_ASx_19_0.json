The antecedent (the part before the 'if') is 'the krimp is in the zool.'\n2. The consequent (the part after the 'then') is 'the snarf will be glonked.'\n\nThe original statement establishes a conditional relationship between these two events: if the first event occurs (krimp in zool), then the second event will occur (snarf being glonked).\n\nNow let's consider the proposed inference:\n\n- The antecedent of the inferred statement is 'the krimp is in the zool and the zool is zapped.'\n- The consequent remains unchanged: 'the snarf will be glonked.'\n\nTo infer the new statement, we would need to establish that when both conditions (krimp in zool",
