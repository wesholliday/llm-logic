The frizzle is dinked (Premise 1).\n2. If Premise 1 is true, then the zarp will splunk (Conclusion).\n\nThe new statement adds an additional condition:\n\n3. The sklonk is grooped (Additional Premise).\n\nWe are asked to infer whether, given both Premises 1 and 3, the conclusion still holds. In other words, does the addition of Premise 3 strengthen or weaken the original argument?\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the relationship between the frizzle being dinked and the sklonk being grooped. If these two events are independent (i.e., one does not affect the other), then adding Premise 3 would have no effect on the truth of the original conclusion. The zarp would still",
