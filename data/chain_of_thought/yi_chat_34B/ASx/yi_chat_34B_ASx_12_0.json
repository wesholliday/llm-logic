The original statement does not specify any conditions other than bringling the splotch, so we cannot definitively say that the bloop will floosh *only* because the crungle is splooted.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided by the original statement, we cannot infer that \"If you bringle the splotch and the crungle is splooted, then the bloop will floosh",
