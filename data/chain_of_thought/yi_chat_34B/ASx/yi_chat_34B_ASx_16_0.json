It only establishes a relationship between the state of the trankle and the behavior of the zorple. Therefore, based on the information given by the original statement, we cannot infer that the presence of additional conditions (such as the drib being flanked) will necessarily result in the zorple quibbling.\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n",
