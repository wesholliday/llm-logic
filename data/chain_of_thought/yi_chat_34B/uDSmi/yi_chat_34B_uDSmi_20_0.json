The statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" tells us that there are only two possible locations for the sunglasses: either in the bag or on her head.\n\n2. The next part of the statement, \"Also, the sunglasses might not be perched on her head,\" suggests that while it's a possibility, it is not a certainty that they are on her head. This leaves open the possibility that they could be in her bag.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can infer that since the sunglasses might not be perched on her head and there are only two possible locations for them, it is likely that they must be in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n",
