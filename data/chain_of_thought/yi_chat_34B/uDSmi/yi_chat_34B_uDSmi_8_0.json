This is an \"exclusive or\" statement, meaning that the remote control cannot be in both places at the same time. It must be in one place or the other.\n\n2. The remote control might not be hiding under the couch. This suggests that there is a possibility that the remote control is not where it could be (under the couch) according to the first statement.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can infer that if the remote control is not under the couch (which is a possibility) and it must be in one place or the other (as per the exclusive or statement), then the only remaining option is that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No response provided. The question requires you to explain your reasoning before answering. Please provide an explanation and then answer 'yes' or 'no' as appropriate.<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let's approach this step by step:\n\n",
