This is a statement of exclusion, meaning the pen must be in one of these two locations.\n2. The pen might not be on my desk. This suggests that there is a possibility that the pen is not where it could be, according to the first statement.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can infer that if the pen is not on my desk (as stated in the second point), then it must be in my bag, as per the first statement. There are no other options given, and since both statements cannot be true at the same time (the pen being on the desk and not on the desk), we can conclude that:\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RE",
