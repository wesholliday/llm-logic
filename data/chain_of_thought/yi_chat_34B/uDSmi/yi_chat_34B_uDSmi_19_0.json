This is an \"or\" statement, meaning that one of these two conditions must be true.\n\n2. The watch might not be on his wrist. This suggests that there is a possibility that the watch is not where we would expect it to be (on the person's wrist).\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can infer that if the watch is not on his wrist, then it must be charging on the dresser, as per the first statement. However, since the second statement only suggests a possibility (\"might not\"), we cannot definitively conclude that the watch is not on his wrist.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can say:\n\nAnswer: No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RESP]No<|im_end|>\n[END]<|im_end|>\n[RE",
