The statement \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand\" tells us that if the notebook is not in the drawer, it must be on the nightstand.\n3. However, the next part of the statement says \"Also, the notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\" This suggests that there is a possibility that the notebook is neither in the drawer nor on the nightstand, but this does not provide any information about where it could be.\n4. Since we are only given two possible locations and both cannot be true at the same time (the notebook cannot be in the drawer and on the nightstand simultaneously), if the notebook is not on the nightstand, then by process of elimination, it must be in the drawer.\n5. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that if the notebook is not on the nightstand, it must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
