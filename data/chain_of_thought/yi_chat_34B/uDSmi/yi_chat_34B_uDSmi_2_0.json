This is an \"exclusive or\" statement, meaning that the book cannot be both on the shelf and resting on the table at the same time; it must be in one place or the other.\n\n2. The book might not be resting on the table. This suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not where we expect it to be based on the first statement.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can infer that if the book is not resting on the table (as stated in the second condition), then it must be on the shelf, because the exclusive or statement tells us that it cannot be both places at once and it must be one place or the other.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Answer: yes<|im_end|>\n[RESP]Yes<|im_end|>\n",
