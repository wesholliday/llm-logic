The statement \"the toy might not be sitting on the shelf\" implies that it is either not on the shelf or we cannot determine if it is on the shelf with certainty.\n3. Since the toy can only be in one of the two locations, and it is not on the shelf (or at least, we don't know for sure if it is), then by process of elimination, the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes<|im_end|>\n\n",
