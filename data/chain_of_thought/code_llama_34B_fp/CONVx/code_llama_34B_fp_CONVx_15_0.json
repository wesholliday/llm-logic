The material implication can be represented as a logical expression:\n\n(dreb was vroombed) \u2192 (dreb was spened)\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was vroombed\" from this statement, we need to check if the contrapositive of the original statement is true. The contrapositive of the original statement is:\n\n(dreb was spened) \u2192 (dreb was vroombed)\n\nWe cannot infer \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was vroombed\" from the given statement because the contrapositive is not true. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no",
