Specifically, it suggests that if the flugel was blimmed, then it was also zargled. However, this statement does not provide any information about what would happen if the flugel was zargled without being blimmed. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
