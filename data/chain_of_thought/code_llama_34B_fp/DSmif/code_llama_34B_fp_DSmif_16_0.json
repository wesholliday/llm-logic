The pen might not be on my desk.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that the pen is in my bag.\n\nTo see why, let's consider the possibilities:\n\n1. If the pen is on my desk, then it is not in my bag.\n2. If the pen is not on my desk, then it must be in my bag.\n\nSince we are given that the pen might not be on my desk, we can eliminate possibility 1. Therefore, we are left with possibility 2, which means that the pen is in my bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
