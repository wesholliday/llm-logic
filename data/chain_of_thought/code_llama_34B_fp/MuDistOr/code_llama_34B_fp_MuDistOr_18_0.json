            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe can infer that the product must have been eco-friendly or it must have been recyclable because the statement \"The product must have been eco-friendly or recyclable\" implies that the product must have had one of these two characteristics. The word \"or\" in this context means that the product must have had either of these two characteristics, but not necessarily both.
