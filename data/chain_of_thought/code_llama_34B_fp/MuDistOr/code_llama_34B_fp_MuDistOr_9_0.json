However, it does not necessarily mean that the package was delivered by both a truck and a plane.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The package must have been delivered by truck or it must have been delivered by plane.\" This is because the original statement only implies that the package was delivered by one of the two options, and does not rule out the possibility that it was delivered by only one of them.\n\nAnswer: No.",
