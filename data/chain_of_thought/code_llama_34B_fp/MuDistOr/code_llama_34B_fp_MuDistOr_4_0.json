This statement does not necessarily imply that the keys were not in both locations at the same time.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The keys must have been in the drawer or they must have been on the hook\" from the given statement. The correct inference would be \"The keys must have been in the drawer or they could have been on the hook.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
