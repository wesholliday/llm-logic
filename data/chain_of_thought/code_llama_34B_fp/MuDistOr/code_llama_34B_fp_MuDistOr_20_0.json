            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe can infer that the building must have had an elevator or wheelchair ramps because the statement \"The building must have had an elevator or wheelchair ramps\" implies that the building had either an elevator or wheelchair ramps, or both. The use of the word \"or\" suggests that the two options are mutually exclusive, meaning that if the building had an elevator, it could not have had wheelchair ramps, and vice versa. Therefore, we can infer that the building must have had an elevator or wheelchair ramps, but we cannot infer that the building had both.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
