However, it does not necessarily mean that the movie was in English and it was also subtitled. It could be that the movie was in English and it was not subtitled, or it could be that the movie was not in English and it was subtitled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The movie must have been in English or it must have been subtitled\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
