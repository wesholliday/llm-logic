This statement does not necessarily imply that the car was in both locations, only that it was in one of them.\n\nTo infer that the car must have been in the garage or it must have been at the repair shop, we would need additional information. For example, if we knew that the car was not in the garage, then we could infer that it must have been at the repair shop. However, without this additional information, we cannot make this inference.\n\nAnswer: No.",
