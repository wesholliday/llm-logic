            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis question is an example of a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that uses a set of premises to reach a conclusion. The premises in this case are \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" and \"Sam did not take a plane.\" The conclusion is \"Erin did not take a train.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that Erin did not take a train, we need to evaluate the validity of the argument. A valid argument is one in which the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the argument is valid because the first premise is a conditional statement, and the second premise is a negation of the antecedent of the conditional. This means that if the antecedent (Sam taking a plane) is false, then the consequent (Erin taking a train) must also be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Erin did not take a train.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
