This means that the two statements are logically equivalent, and if one is true, then the other must also be true.\n\nSince we know that Tom did not watch football, we can conclude that Jen did not watch basketball. This is because the statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" implies that Jen would have watched basketball if Tom had watched football. However, since Tom did not watch football, we can infer that Jen did not watch basketball either.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
