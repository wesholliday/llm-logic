This means that the two statements are logically equivalent, and if one is true, then the other must also be true.\n\nSince we know that Jeff did not play basketball, we can conclude that the statement \"Amy played tennis\" is false. Therefore, we can infer that Amy did not play tennis.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
