The statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" means that if Ben ate pasta, Kate would also eat salad. However, we are also given the information that Ben did not eat pasta. Therefore, we can conclude that Kate did not eat salad either, because the condition for her eating salad (i.e., Ben eating pasta) did not occur.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
