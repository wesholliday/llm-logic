This is because fertilizer provides nutrients to the grass, which helps it grow and stay healthy.\n\nHowever, if there is a drought, it may not be possible for the lawn to be lush and green, even if it is fertilized. Droughts can cause water stress, which can limit the growth of the grass and make it more susceptible to disease and pests.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if I fertilize the lawn and there is a drought, it will be lush and green.\n\nAnswer: No.",
