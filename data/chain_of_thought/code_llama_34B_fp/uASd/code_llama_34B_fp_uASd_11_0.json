However, this statement does not necessarily imply that getting enough sleep and doing hard labor will prevent fatigue.\n\nThere are several factors that can contribute to fatigue, including physical exertion, mental stress, and overall health. While sleep is an important factor in maintaining physical and mental well-being, it is not the only factor that determines whether someone will be tired.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired. It is possible that doing hard labor could cause fatigue even if you get enough sleep, as there are other factors at play.\n\nAnswer: No.",
