The statement \"If the dog is in the yard, then it is barking\" means that whenever the dog is in the yard, it is barking. However, this statement does not imply that the dog is barking when it is in the yard and asleep. In fact, it is possible that the dog is not barking when it is in the yard and asleep.\n\nAnswer: No",
