However, if I water the plants and there is no sunlight, it does not necessarily mean that they will grow. The absence of sunlight can hinder the growth of plants, as they require sunlight to undergo photosynthesis and produce energy. Therefore, we cannot infer that if I water the plants and there is no sunlight, they will grow.\n\nAnswer: No.",
