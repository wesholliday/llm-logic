However, this statement does not imply that the car will run smoothly if the transmission is shot, even if the oil is changed.\n\nThe statement \"If I change the oil and the transmission is shot, the car will run smoothly\" is a false statement. Changing the oil will not fix a shot transmission, and the car will not run smoothly even if the oil is changed.\n\nAnswer: No.",
