However, the statement does not imply that the good time will be the only outcome of going to the concert. It is possible that other factors, such as the performance, the atmosphere, or the company, will also contribute to the overall experience.\n\nThe statement \"If we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time\" is a hypothetical scenario that is not based on any real-world evidence. It is not possible to infer that going to a concert and experiencing a bombing will result in a good time, as this scenario is highly unlikely and potentially dangerous.\n\nAnswer: No.",
