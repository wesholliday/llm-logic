However, if I exercise and eat junk food, it is not necessarily true that I will lose weight. Eating junk food can offset the weight loss that occurs from exercising, as junk food is high in calories and low in nutrients. Therefore, we cannot infer that if I exercise and eat junk food, I will lose weight.\n\nAnswer: No.",
