If the package is misrouted, it means that it has been sent to the wrong location, and it will not arrive at the intended destination.\n\nTherefore, if the package has shipped and it was misrouted, it is unlikely that it will arrive today. The package may be delayed or lost, and it may take additional time to reroute it to the correct destination.\n\nAnswer: No.",
