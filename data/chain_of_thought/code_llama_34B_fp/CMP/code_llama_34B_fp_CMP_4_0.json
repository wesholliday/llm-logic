    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it\u2019s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn\u2019t get the offer, then if Priya doesn\u2019t, Diego will. Moreover, it\u2019s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn\u2019t get the offer, Diego will?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it\u2019s most likely that Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. This means that the hiring manager has a strong preference for Priya over Julian and a weaker preference for Julian over Diego.\n\nWe are also given that if Julian doesn\u2019t get the offer, then if Priya doesn\u2019t, Diego will. This means that if Julian is not offered the role, the hiring manager will offer the role to Diego.\n\nNow, we are asked if it is likely that if Priya doesn\u2019t get the offer, Diego will. To answer this question, we need to consider the information we have been given. We know that the hiring manager has a strong preference for Priya over Julian and a weaker preference for Julian over Diego. We also know that if Julian doesn\u2019t get the offer, then if Priya doesn\u2019t, Diego will.\n\nBased on this information, it is likely that if Priya doesn\u2019t get the offer, Diego will. This is because the hiring manager has a weaker preference for Julian over Diego, and if Julian doesn\u2019t get the offer, the hiring manager will offer the role to Diego. Therefore, if Priya doesn\u2019t get the offer, it is likely that Diego will.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
