    "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it\u2019s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be. Moreover, it\u2019s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on the assumption that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits, and that apples are likely to be the top-selling fruit this year, followed by bananas, and then oranges. The argument also assumes that if bananas are not the top-selling fruit, then oranges will be.\n\nFrom this information, we can conclude that if apples are not the top-selling fruit, then it is likely that oranges will be. This is because if apples are not the top-selling fruit, then bananas will not be either, since they are closely followed by apples in terms of sales. Therefore, oranges will be the top-selling fruit.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
