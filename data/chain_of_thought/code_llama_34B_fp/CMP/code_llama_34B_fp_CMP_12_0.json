Publishing data indicates thrillers will likely be the #1 genre this year, followed closely by romances, with mysteries far behind. These genres lead the market, so if romances aren\u2019t #1, then if thrillers aren\u2019t, mysteries will be. Moreover, thrillers likely will lead sales and hence romances likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if thrillers aren\u2019t #1, mysteries will be?",

This is because thrillers are the top-selling fiction genre, and they are expected to lead sales. Additionally, romances are the second most popular genre, and they are likely to be in the top 2 spots. Mysteries, on the other hand, are the least popular genre and are likely to be towards the bottom of the list.\n\nTherefore, it is unlikely that mysteries will be the #1 genre, and it is more likely that they will be towards the bottom of the list. However, it is still possible that mysteries could be the #1 genre if thrillers and romances do not perform as well as expected.\n\nAnswer: No.",
