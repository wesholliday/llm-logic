    "user_prompt": "Suppose that increases to minimum wage, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness are the most likely new laws. Only one new law will be passed this session. Congress watchers expect a minimum wage hike is most probable, followed by paid family leave, with loan forgiveness being much less likely. These are the only likely new laws, so if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen. Moreover, a minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen. Does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on the following premises:\n\n1. Increases to minimum wage, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness are the most likely new laws.\n2. Paid family leave is less likely than a minimum wage hike.\n3. If paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen.\n4. A minimum wage hike is likely to happen.\n\nBased on these premises, we can conclude that if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, it is likely that loan forgiveness will happen. This is because paid leave is less likely than a minimum wage hike, and if paid leave doesn't happen, then loan forgiveness is the next most likely option.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
