    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on the assumption that if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, then Georgia is likely to add the most jobs. This is because Tennessee is expected to add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, and Missouri's growth is significantly lower. Therefore, if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, it is likely that Georgia will add the most jobs.\n\nHowever, it is not necessarily true that if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, then Missouri will. This is because there is no information to suggest that Missouri will add more jobs than Georgia if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs. In fact, the argument suggests that Georgia is more likely to add the most jobs if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs.\n\nTherefore, it is not necessarily true that if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, then Missouri will. The argument only suggests that it is likely that Georgia will add the most jobs if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs.\n\nAnswer: No.",
