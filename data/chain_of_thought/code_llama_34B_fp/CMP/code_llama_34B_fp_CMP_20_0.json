    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on the assumption that there are only three major morning drinks: coffee, tea, and soda. If tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then soda will retain the most morning drinkers. This is because tea is the second most popular morning drink, and soda is the least popular. Therefore, if tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, it is likely that soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nHowever, it is also possible that coffee will retain the most morning drinkers, and therefore soda will not retain the most morning drinkers. This is because coffee is the most popular morning drink, and it is possible that it will retain the most morning drinkers even if tea doesn't.\n\nTherefore, it is not necessarily true that if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. It is possible that coffee will retain the most morning drinkers, and therefore soda will not retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nAnswer: No.",
