    "user_prompt": "Suppose that banana bread, chocolate chip cookies, and carrot cake are the most popular baked goods. According to a consumer survey, it is very likely that banana bread will be the top seller, followed closely by chocolate chip cookies, with carrot cake far behind. These are the only top sellers, so if chocolate chip cookies aren\u2019t the top seller, then if banana bread isn\u2019t, carrot cake will be. Moreover, it is likely banana bread will be top and hence that chocolate chip cookies won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if banana bread isn\u2019t the top seller, carrot cake will be?",

This is because banana bread is the most likely to be the top seller, and if it is not, then chocolate chip cookies will be. However, if chocolate chip cookies are not the top seller, then carrot cake will be. Therefore, if banana bread is not the top seller, it is likely that carrot cake will be.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
