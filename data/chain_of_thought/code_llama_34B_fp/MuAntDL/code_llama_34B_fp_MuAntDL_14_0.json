However, this does not necessarily mean that the contract was valid for exactly a year. It could have been valid for a year and a few months, or it could have been renewed multiple times.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The contract must have been valid for a year\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
