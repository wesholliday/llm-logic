If the event was entirely formal, we would simply say \"formal\" instead of \"semi-formal.\" Therefore, the fact that the description includes the word \"semi-formal\" suggests that the event was not entirely formal, but it was still somewhat formal, which means that we can infer that the event must have been formal.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
