            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is a conditional statement. It expresses a cause-and-effect relationship between the doll being plastic and the truck being metal. The statement \"The doll was not plastic\" negates the antecedent of the conditional statement, which means that the doll was not plastic.\n\nNow, we can use the principle of explosion (also known as ex falso quodlibet) to infer that the consequent of the conditional statement is also false. In other words, we can conclude that \"The truck was not metal\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
