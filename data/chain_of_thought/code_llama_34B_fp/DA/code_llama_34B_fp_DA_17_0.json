            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\" can be represented as a conditional statement, written as \"Ben ate pasta \u2192 Kate ate the salad\". This statement is saying that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate also ate the salad.\n\nThe statement \"Ben did not eat pasta\" can be represented as a negation of the statement \"Ben ate pasta\", written as \"\u00acBen ate pasta\". This statement is saying that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"Kate did not eat the salad\" from the given statements, we need to apply the rules of logic. In this case, we can use the rule of modus tollens, which states that if a conditional statement is true and the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is false, then the consequent (the \"then\" part) must also be false.\n\nUsing this rule, we can determine that if \"Ben did not eat pasta\" is true, then \"Kate did not eat the salad\" must also be true. Therefore, we can infer \"Kate did not eat the salad\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
