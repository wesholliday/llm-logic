            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis is a classic example of a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that uses a set of premises to reach a conclusion. The first premise is \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den,\" and the second premise is \"The bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"The wolf was not in the den\" from these premises, we need to examine the logical form of the argument. The first premise is an if-then statement, which can be represented as \"B \u2192 W,\" where B represents the bear being in the cave and W represents the wolf being in the den. The second premise is a negation of the first premise, which can be represented as \"\u00acB.\"\n\nUsing these representations, we can construct the argument as follows:\n\n1. B \u2192 W\n2. \u00acB\n3. \u2234 \u00acW\n\nThe conclusion, \"The wolf was not in the den,\" is represented by the symbol \u00acW. To determine whether this conclusion follows logically from the premises, we can use a truth table.\n\nTruth Table:\n\n| B | W | B \u2192 W | \u00acB | \u00acW |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| T | T | T | F | F |\n| T | F | F | F | T |\n| F | T | T | T | F |\n| F | F | T | T | T |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that the conclusion \"The wolf was not in the den\" (\u00acW) follows logically from the premises \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" (B \u2192 W) and \"The bear was not in the cave\" (\u00acB). Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
