            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" can be represented as a conditional statement, which is of the form \"If A, then B\". In this case, A is \"Tom watched football\" and B is \"Jen watched basketball\".\n\nThe statement \"Tom did not watch football\" is a negation of A, which means that A is false.\n\nNow, we can use the rule of inference called \"modus tollens\" to draw a conclusion about B. Modus tollens states that if A is false, then B is also false. In this case, since A is false (i.e., Tom did not watch football), we can infer that B is also false (i.e., Jen did not watch basketball).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that \"Jen did not watch basketball\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
