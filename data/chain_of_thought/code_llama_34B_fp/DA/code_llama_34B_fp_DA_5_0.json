            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" can be represented as a conditional statement, written as \"Jeff \u21a6 Amy\". This means that whenever Jeff plays basketball, Amy will play tennis.\n\nThe statement \"Jeff did not play basketball\" can be represented as a negation of the statement \"Jeff played basketball\", written as \"\u00acJeff\".\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"Amy did not play tennis\" from the given information, we need to apply the rules of logic. Specifically, we need to apply the rule of inference known as modus tollens.\n\nModus tollens is a rule of inference that allows us to deduce the negation of a conclusion from the premises of a conditional statement and the negation of the antecedent. In other words, if we know that \"if A, then B\" and \"not A\", then we can deduce \"not B\".\n\nIn this case, the premises are \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" and \"Jeff did not play basketball\". We can apply modus tollens to deduce \"Amy did not play tennis\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
