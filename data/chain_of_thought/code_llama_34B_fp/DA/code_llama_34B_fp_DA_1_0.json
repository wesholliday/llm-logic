The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" implies that Mary and Sue were both at the wedding. However, we are also given the information that \"Mary was not at the wedding.\" This contradicts the initial statement, as it suggests that Mary was not at the wedding, which means that Sue was also not at the wedding. Therefore, we can infer that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
