It implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy would also go to the zoo. However, the statement \"Joe did not go to the park\" contradicts the first statement, as it indicates that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\" from the given statements. The absence of evidence that Lucy went to the zoo does not mean that she did not go. It is possible that Lucy went to the zoo even if Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: No.",
