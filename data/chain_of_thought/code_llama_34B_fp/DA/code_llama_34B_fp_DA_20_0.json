It expresses a cause-and-effect relationship between the apple being red and the banana being yellow. The statement \"The apple was not red\" contradicts the first statement, as it implies that the apple was not red.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"The banana was not yellow\". If we assume that the first statement is true, then we can infer that the banana was not yellow. However, since the first statement is false, we cannot infer that the banana was not yellow.\n\nAnswer: No.",
