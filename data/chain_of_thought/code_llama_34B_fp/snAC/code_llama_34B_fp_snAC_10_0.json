            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis is a classic example of a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that uses a set of premises to reach a conclusion. In this case, the premises are \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" and \"The cat was outside.\" The conclusion is \"The dog was inside.\"\n\nTo determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises, we need to examine the validity of the argument. A valid argument is one in which the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nIn this case, the argument is valid because the first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true, then the consequent (the part after the \"then\") must also be true. Since the cat was outside, and the first premise states that if the dog was inside, then the cat would be outside, it logically follows that the dog was inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
