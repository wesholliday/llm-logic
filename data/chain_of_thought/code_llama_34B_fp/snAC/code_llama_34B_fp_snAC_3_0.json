The argument is:\n\nPremise 1: If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\nPremise 2: The book is a mystery novel.\nConclusion: Therefore, the book was written by James.\n\nThe argument is valid because the premises logically entail the conclusion. However, the conclusion is false because there may be other authors who have written mystery novels. Therefore, the argument is a counterexample of the principle of modus ponens, which states that if the premises of an argument are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: No.",
