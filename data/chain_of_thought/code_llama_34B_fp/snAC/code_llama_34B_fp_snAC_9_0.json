The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" implies that there is a causal relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. However, the statement \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" does not provide any information about the causal relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. Therefore, it does not necessarily follow that \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true.\n\nAnswer: No.",
