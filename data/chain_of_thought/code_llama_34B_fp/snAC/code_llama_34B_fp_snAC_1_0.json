            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis is a classic example of a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that uses a set of statements to reach a conclusion. In this case, the two premises are:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n2. Sue was at the wedding.\n\nThe conclusion that can be drawn from these premises is:\n\n3. Mary was at the wedding.\n\nThe reasoning behind this conclusion is that the first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. Since Sue was at the wedding (according to the second premise), it must be the case that Mary was at the wedding as well. Therefore, the conclusion is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
