The first statement, \"The fleeg was not bluttered,\" implies that the fleeg did not have the property of bluttering. The second statement, \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned,\" is a conditional statement that implies that if the fleeg had the property of bluttering, it would also have the property of surning. However, since we know that the fleeg did not have the property of bluttering, we can conclude that it did not surn either.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
