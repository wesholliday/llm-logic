If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\n\nTo infer 'The flug was not zimmed', we need to show that the negation of the second statement is true. The negation of the second statement is:\n\n2. If the flug was not blummed, then the flug was not zimmed.\n\nSince the first statement is 'The flug was not blummed', we can substitute this into the negation of the second statement to get:\n\n2. If the flug was not blummed, then the flug was not zimmed.\n\nThis statement is logically equivalent to the original second statement, and therefore, we can infer that 'The flug was not zimmed'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
