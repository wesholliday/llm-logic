If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\n\nTo infer whether the glip was not tragged, we need to analyze the given statements and their logical relationships.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the glip was not slogged. This means that the glip did not undergo the process of slogging.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is based on the assumption that the glip was slogged. However, since we have already established that the glip was not slogged, we can infer that the second statement is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the glip was not tragged based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No.",
