The second premise, 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked', implies that if the splat had undergone a change in shape or form, it would have quanked.\n\nSince the splat did not undergo a change in shape or form, we can conclude that it did not quank. Therefore, the answer is 'yes'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
