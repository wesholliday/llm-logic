If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that the zinger was not smoogled. This is because if the zinger was fraggled, then it would have been smoogled, according to the second statement. However, since the zinger was not fraggled, it cannot be smoogled. Therefore, we can conclude that the zinger was not smoogled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
