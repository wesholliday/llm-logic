It states that either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible cases:\n\nCase 1: The fleeg is bluttered.\n\nIn this case, the second premise is true, and the fleeg is either bluttered or surned.\n\nCase 2: The fleeg is not bluttered.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is true, and the fleeg might not be surned. However, this does not mean that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that 'The fleeg is bluttered'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
