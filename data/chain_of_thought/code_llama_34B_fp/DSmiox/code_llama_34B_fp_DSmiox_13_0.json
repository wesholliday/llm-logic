However, the second premise, 'Either the glip is slogged or it must be tragged', implies that the glip is either slogged or tragged.\n\nSince the glip is not tragged (according to the first premise), it must be slogged (according to the second premise). Therefore, we can infer 'The glip is slogged'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
