The second premise, 'Either the whiffle is shanked or it is tinked', provides us with two exclusive options: either the whiffle is shanked or it is tinked. Since we have already established that the whiffle is not tinked, the only remaining option is that the whiffle is shanked. Therefore, we can infer 'The whiffle is shanked'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
