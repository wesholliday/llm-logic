This means that the wug is not in the state of being bimmed.\n\nNext, we can see that 'Either the wug is flooped or it is bimmed' is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the options must be true. In this case, we know that the wug is not bimmed, so the only remaining option is that the wug is flooped.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The wug is flooped'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
