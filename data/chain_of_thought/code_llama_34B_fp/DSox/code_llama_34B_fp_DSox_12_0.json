Either the smip is shripped or it is lupped.\n\nTo infer 'The smip is shripped', we need to show that the first statement implies the second statement.\n\nWe can start by analyzing the first statement: \"The smip is not lupped.\" This statement can be translated as \"It is not the case that the smip is lupped.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement: \"Either the smip is shripped or it is lupped.\" This statement can be translated as \"It is not the case that the smip is shripped and it is not the case that the smip is lupped.\"\n\nWe can see that the second statement is a negation of the first statement. Therefore, if the first statement is true, the second statement must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if \"The smip is not lupped\" is true, then \"The smip is shripped\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
