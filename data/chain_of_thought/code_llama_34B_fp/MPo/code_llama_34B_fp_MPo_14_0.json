The second premise, 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den', is a conditional statement that tells us that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf is in the den.\n\nSince we know that the bear is in the cave, we can conclude that the wolf is in the den, based on the second premise. Therefore, we can infer 'The wolf was in the den'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
