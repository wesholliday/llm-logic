The first premise, 'The griffin was in the forest', states that the griffin was present in the forest. The second premise, 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest', is a conditional statement that implies that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must also have been in the forest.\n\nSince we have established that the griffin was in the forest, we can conclude that the unicorn was also in the forest, based on the second premise. Therefore, we can infer 'The unicorn was in the forest'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
