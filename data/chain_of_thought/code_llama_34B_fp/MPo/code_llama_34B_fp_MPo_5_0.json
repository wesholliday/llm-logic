This is an example of a valid argument, where the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe first premise, 'Jeff played basketball', is a statement of fact that is assumed to be true. The second premise, 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis', is a conditional statement that expresses a causal relationship between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis.\n\nSince Jeff did play basketball, we can conclude that Amy played tennis, based on the causal relationship expressed in the second premise. Therefore, we can infer 'Amy played tennis'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
