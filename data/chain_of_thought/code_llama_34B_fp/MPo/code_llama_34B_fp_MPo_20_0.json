The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement that implies a causal relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana.\n\nHowever, the conditional statement does not guarantee that the banana will always be yellow if the apple is red. It only implies a possible correlation between the two fruits. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The banana was yellow\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No.",
