The conditional statement can be rewritten as 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy would go to the zoo', which means that if Joe went to the park, Lucy would also go to the zoo.\n\nSince we know that Joe went to the park, we can infer that Lucy went to the zoo because of the causal relationship between their actions.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
