The first premise, 'The book was written by James', provides us with information about the author of the book. The second premise, 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel', provides us with a conditional statement that links the author of the book to the genre of the book.\n\nSince we know that the book was written by James, and we know that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel, we can logically conclude that the book is a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
