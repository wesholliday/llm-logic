The second premise, 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake', is a conditional statement that implies that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was also awake.\n\nSince the first premise states that the vampire was awake, and the second premise implies that the mummy was awake if the vampire was awake, we can conclude that the mummy was awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
