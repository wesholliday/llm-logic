It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk (N)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer 'The pen is in my bag' (I) from these statements.\n\nTo do this, we can use a logical argument, where we start with the premises (E and N) and try to deduce the conclusion (I).\n\nHere's the argument:\n\n1. E \u2227 N\n2. \u00acE \u2192 \u00acN (contraposition of 1)\n3. \u00acN (given)\n4. \u00acE (modus tollens of 2 and 3)\n5. I (contraposition of 4)\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The pen is in my bag' (I) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
