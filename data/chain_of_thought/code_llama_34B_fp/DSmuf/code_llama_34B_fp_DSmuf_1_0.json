This means that if Fido is not in the garden, then Fido must be inside.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden. This means that Fido is not in the garden.\n\nTherefore, based on the first premise, if Fido is not in the garden, then Fido must be inside. Since we have established that Fido is not in the garden, we can conclude that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
