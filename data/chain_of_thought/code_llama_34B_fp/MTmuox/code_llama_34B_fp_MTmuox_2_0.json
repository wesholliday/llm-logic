The second premise, 'If the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint', implies that if the wug was flooped, it would have bimmed the zoint.\n\nSince the wug did not bim the zoint (according to the first premise), it cannot be the case that the wug was flooped (according to the second premise). Therefore, we can infer 'The wug was not flooped'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
