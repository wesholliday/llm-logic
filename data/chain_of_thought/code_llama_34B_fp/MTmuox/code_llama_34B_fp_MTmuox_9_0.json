The second premise, 'If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished', implies that if the twonk was plinked, it must have been varnished.\n\nSince we know that the twonk was not necessarily varnished, and if it was plinked, it must have been varnished, we can conclude that the twonk was not plinked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
