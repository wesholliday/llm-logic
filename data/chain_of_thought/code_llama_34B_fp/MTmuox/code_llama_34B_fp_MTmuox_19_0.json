The second premise, 'If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged', implies that if the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged.\n\nSince the smonk did not plag, and if the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged, we can conclude that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
