However, the second premise, 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged', implies that if the clug was fleeked, it must have been snugged.\n\nSince we know that the clug was not necessarily snugged, and if it was fleeked, it must have been snugged, we can conclude that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
