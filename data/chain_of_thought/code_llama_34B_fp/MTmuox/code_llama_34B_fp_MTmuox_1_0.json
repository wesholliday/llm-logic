The second premise, 'If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled', implies that if the flugel was blimmed, it must have been zargled.\n\nSince the flugel was not necessarily zargled (first premise), and if it was blimmed, it must have been zargled (second premise), we can conclude that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
