The second premise, 'If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged', implies that if the glip was slogged, it would have tragged.\n\nSince the glip did not tragg, it cannot have been slogged, because if it was slogged, it would have tragged. Therefore, we can infer 'The glip was not slogged'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
