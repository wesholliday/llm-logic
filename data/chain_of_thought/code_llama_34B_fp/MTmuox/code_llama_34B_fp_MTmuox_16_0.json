The second premise, 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink', implies that if the sneg was crampled, it would have sproted the frink.\n\nSince the sneg did not sprot the frink, and sproting the frink is a necessary condition for the sneg to be crampled, we can conclude that the sneg was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
