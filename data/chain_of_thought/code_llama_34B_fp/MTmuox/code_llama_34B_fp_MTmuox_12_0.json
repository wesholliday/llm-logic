The second premise, 'If the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint', implies that if the smip was shripped, it must have lupped the zoint.\n\nSince the smip was not shripped (according to the first premise), we can conclude that the smip did not lupped the zoint (according to the second premise). Therefore, we can infer 'The smip was not shripped'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
