The second premise, 'If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger must have been smoogled', implies that if the zinger was fraggled, it must have been smoogled.\n\nSince we know that the zinger was not necessarily smoogled (from the first premise), and if it was fraggled, it must have been smoogled (from the second premise), we can conclude that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
