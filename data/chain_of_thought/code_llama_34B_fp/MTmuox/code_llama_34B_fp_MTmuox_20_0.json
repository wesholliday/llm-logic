The second premise, 'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned', means that if the fleeg was bluttered, it must have been surned.\n\nSince we know that the fleeg was not necessarily surned (from the first premise), and if it was bluttered, it must have been surned (from the second premise), we can conclude that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, we can infer 'The fleeg was not bluttered' from the given premises.",
