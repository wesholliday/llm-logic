The second premise, 'If the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed', implies that if the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed.\n\nSince the flug was not necessarily zimmed (first premise), and if it was blummed, then it must have been zimmed (second premise), we can conclude that the flug was not blummed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
