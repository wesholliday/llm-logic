The second premise, 'If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled', implies that if the wug was sproinged, it must have been garpled.\n\nSince we know that the wug was not necessarily garpled, and if it was sproinged, it must have been garpled, we can conclude that the wug was not sproinged.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
