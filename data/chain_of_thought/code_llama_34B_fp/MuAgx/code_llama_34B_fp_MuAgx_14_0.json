This is because the given statement only implies that the wumble is both gronk for a flibbit and zooble, but it does not explicitly state that the wumble is both gronk for a flibbit and zooble.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no. We cannot infer \"The wumble must be gronk for a flibbit and zooble\" from the given statement.",
