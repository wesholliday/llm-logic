In this case, the condition is \"The frozz must be zooble quimble plonk,\" which is a necessary condition for the conclusion to be true. However, we do not have enough information to determine whether the condition is actually true or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The frozz must be zooble quimble plonk and plimp a quimble\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
