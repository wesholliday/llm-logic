It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nThe first premise tells us that the jacket is either draped over the chair or hanging in the closet. The second premise tells us that the jacket is not hanging in the closet. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.",
