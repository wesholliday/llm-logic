It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nTo do this, we need to consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. The missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n2. The missing sock is under the bed.\n3. The missing sock is not in the laundry basket and not under the bed.\n\nIf the missing sock is in the laundry basket, then the first premise is true, and we cannot infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nIf the missing sock is under the bed, then the first premise is true, and the second premise is false, so we cannot infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nIf the missing sock is not in the laundry basket and not under the bed, then the first premise is false, and we cannot infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: No.",
