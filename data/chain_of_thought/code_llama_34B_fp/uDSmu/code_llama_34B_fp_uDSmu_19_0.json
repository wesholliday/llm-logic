It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\n\nFrom the first piece of information, we can infer that the watch is either charging on the dresser or it's not on his wrist. However, we cannot infer that the watch is charging on the dresser because the first piece of information only tells us that the watch is either charging on the dresser or it's not on his wrist, but it doesn't tell us which one is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: No.",
