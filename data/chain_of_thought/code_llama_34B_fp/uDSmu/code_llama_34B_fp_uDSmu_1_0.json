It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n\nWe can infer that Fido is inside because the first premise states that either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden. Since we are told that Fido must not be in the garden (second premise), we can conclude that Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
