It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\n\nWe can infer that the milk is on the counter if we assume that the first premise is true and the second premise is false. If the first premise is true, then the milk is either on the counter or in the fridge. If the second premise is false, then the milk is not in the fridge, which means it must be on the counter. Therefore, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
