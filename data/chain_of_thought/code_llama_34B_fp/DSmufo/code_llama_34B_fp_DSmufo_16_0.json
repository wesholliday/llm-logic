The second statement \"Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag\" provides two possible locations for the pen, and since we have already established that it is not on the desk, the only remaining possibility is that it is in the bag. Therefore, we can conclude that the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
