The second premise, \"Either the cat must be playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch,\" provides us with two options: either the cat is in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch. Since we have already established that the cat is not in the bedroom, the only remaining option is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
