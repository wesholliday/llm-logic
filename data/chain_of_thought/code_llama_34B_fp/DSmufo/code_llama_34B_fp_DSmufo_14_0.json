The first premise states that it is not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge, which means that the milk is not in the fridge. The second premise states that either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter, which means that if the milk is not in the fridge, it must be on the counter. Therefore, we can conclude that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
