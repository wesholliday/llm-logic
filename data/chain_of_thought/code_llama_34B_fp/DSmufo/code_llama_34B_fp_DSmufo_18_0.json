            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe can infer that the notebook is in the drawer because the premises together imply that the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand. The first premise states that it is not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand, which means that the notebook is not necessarily sitting on the nightstand. The second premise states that either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer, which means that if the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand, it must be in the drawer. Therefore, we can conclude that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
