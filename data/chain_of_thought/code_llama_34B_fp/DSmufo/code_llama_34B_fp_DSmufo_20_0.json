The second premise, \"Either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag,\" provides us with two options: either the sunglasses are perched on her head or they are in her bag. Since we have already established that the sunglasses are not perched on her head, the only remaining option is that they are in her bag. Therefore, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
