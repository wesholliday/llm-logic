The premise assumes that if the customer was greeted, then they were not greeted warmly, while the conclusion assumes that if the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted. However, these two assumptions are contradictory, as it is possible for a customer to be greeted and also be greeted warmly. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
