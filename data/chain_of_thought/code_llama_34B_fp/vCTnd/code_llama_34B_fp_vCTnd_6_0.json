The argument assumes that if the clothes were washed, then they were not washed properly, and if they were washed properly, then they were not washed. However, this assumption is not necessarily true. It is possible for the clothes to be washed properly and still be clean. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
