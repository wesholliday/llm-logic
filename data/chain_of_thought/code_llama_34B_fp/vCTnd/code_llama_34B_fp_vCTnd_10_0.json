The conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nThe premise states that if advice was offered, it was not helpful advice. This means that either no advice was offered or the advice that was offered was not helpful. However, the conclusion states that if helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered. This means that if helpful advice was offered, then no advice was offered.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because it is possible for both advice to have been offered and for it to have been helpful. The conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: No.",
