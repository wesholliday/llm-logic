The premise states that if a recommendation was made, then it was not a strong recommendation. However, this does not mean that if a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made. It is possible for a strong recommendation to be made without a recommendation being made at all. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
