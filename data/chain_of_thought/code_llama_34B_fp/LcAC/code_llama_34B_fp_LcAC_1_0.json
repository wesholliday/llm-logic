            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is an example of a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that uses a set of premises to reach a conclusion. In this case, the premises are:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n2. Sue was at the wedding.\n\nThe conclusion that can be logically drawn from these premises is:\n\n3. Mary was at the wedding.\n\nThis conclusion follows from the premises because if Mary was not at the wedding, then the first premise would not be true, and the second premise would still be true. Therefore, the only way to make the argument valid is to assume that Mary was at the wedding, which is the conclusion that is logically drawn from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
