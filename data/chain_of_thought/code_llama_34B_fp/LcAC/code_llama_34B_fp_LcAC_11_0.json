It expresses a cause-and-effect relationship between the cake being chocolate and the muffins being blueberry.\n\nThe statement \"The muffins were blueberry\" is a factual statement that simply states the flavor of the muffins.\n\nTo logically conclude \"The cake was chocolate,\" we need to determine whether the two statements are consistent with each other.
