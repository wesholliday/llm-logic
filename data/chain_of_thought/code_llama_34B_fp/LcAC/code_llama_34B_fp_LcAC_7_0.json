It states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris would also finish the race. The second premise, \"Chris finished the race,\" is a statement that Chris finished the race.\n\nTo logically conclude that Alex finished the race, we need to use the principle of modus ponens. This principle states that if a conditional statement is true and the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is true, then the consequent (the \"then\" part) must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race,\" and the antecedent is \"Chris finished the race.\" Since we know that Chris finished the race, we can conclude that Alex finished the race, which is the consequent.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
