This possibility is not necessarily a certainty, but it is a possibility.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled\" implies that there is no necessity or obligation for the flob to have been skizzled. This statement suggests that the flob's status of being skizzled or not is not a fixed or determinate fact.\n\nTherefore, while we can infer that the flob might not have been skizzled, we cannot infer that it's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled. The two statements have different implications and convey different meanings.\n\nAnswer: No.",
