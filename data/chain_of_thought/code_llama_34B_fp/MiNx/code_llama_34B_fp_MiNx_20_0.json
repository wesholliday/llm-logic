This possibility is not necessarily a certainty, but it is a possibility.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered\" implies that there is no possibility that the fleeg was bluttered. This statement is stronger than the first one, as it implies that there is no possibility that the fleeg was bluttered, whereas the first statement only implies that there is a possibility that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered\" from \"The fleeg might not have been bluttered\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
