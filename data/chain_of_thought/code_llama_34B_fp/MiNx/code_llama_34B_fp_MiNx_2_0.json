This means that it is not certain that the wug was flooped, and therefore, it is not logically necessary to conclude that the wug must have been flooped.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the wug must have been flooped\" from \"The wug might not have been flooped\". This is because the statement \"The wug might not have been flooped\" only implies the possibility that the wug was not flooped, and does not rule out the possibility that the wug was indeed flooped. Therefore, it is still possible that the wug must have been flooped, even though it is not certain.\n\nAnswer: No.",
