This means that it is not certain that the smip has been shripped.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that it is not the case that the smip must have been shripped. It is possible that the smip has been shripped, but we do not have enough information to confirm this.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the smip must have been shripped\" from \"The smip might not have been shripped\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
