This possibility is not necessarily the same as the statement \"It's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed.\"\n\nThe latter statement implies that it is not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed, which means that it is possible that the flugel was not blimmed. However, it is also possible that the flugel was blimmed, but we just don't know for sure.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed\" from \"The flugel might not have been blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
