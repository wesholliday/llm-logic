This possibility is not necessarily a guarantee that the dreb was not vroombed, but it does suggest that there is some uncertainty or doubt about whether the dreb was vroombed.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the dreb must have been vroombed\" from this statement. The statement only implies that there is a possibility that the dreb was not vroombed, and it does not rule out the possibility that the dreb was vroombed. Therefore, we cannot conclude that it is not the case that the dreb must have been vroombed.\n\nAnswer: No.",
