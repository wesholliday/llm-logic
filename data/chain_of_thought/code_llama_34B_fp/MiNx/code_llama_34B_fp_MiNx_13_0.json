This possibility is not necessarily a certainty, but it is a possibility.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the glip must have been slogged\" implies that there is no possibility that the glip was slogged. This statement is stronger than the previous one, as it implies that there is no possibility that the glip was slogged, whereas the previous statement only implies that there is a possibility that the glip was not slogged.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the glip must have been slogged\" from \"The glip might not have been slogged\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
