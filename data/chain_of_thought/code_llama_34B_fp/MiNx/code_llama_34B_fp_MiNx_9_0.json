This possibility is not necessarily a certainty, but it is a possibility.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the twonk must have been plinked\" implies that there is no possibility that the twonk has been plinked. This statement is stronger than the previous one, as it implies that there is no possibility that the twonk has been plinked, whereas the previous statement only implies that there is a possibility that the twonk has not been plinked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the twonk must have been plinked\" from \"The twonk might not have been plinked\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
