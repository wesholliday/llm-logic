This means that the statement is not making a definitive claim about the clug's fleeking status.\n\nHowever, the statement \"It's not the case that the clug must have been fleeked\" is a stronger claim. It implies that there is no possibility that the clug has been fleeked, and that it is definitely not the case.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the clug must have been fleeked\" from \"The clug might not have been fleeked\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
