This possibility is not necessarily a certainty, but it is a possibility.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled\" implies that there is no possibility that the smonk has been vreebled. This statement is stronger than the previous one, as it implies that there is no possibility that the smonk has been vreebled, whereas the previous statement only implies that there is a possibility that the smonk has not been vreebled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled\" from \"The smonk might not have been vreebled\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
