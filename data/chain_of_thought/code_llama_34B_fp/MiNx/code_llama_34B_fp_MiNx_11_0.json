This possibility is not necessarily a certainty, but it is a possibility.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed\" implies that there is no possibility that the flug was blummed. This statement is stronger than the first one, as it implies that the flug definitely was not blummed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed\" from \"The flug might not have been blummed\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
