This possibility is not necessarily a certainty, but it is a possibility.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled\" implies that there is no necessity or obligation for the fribble to have been snurgled. This statement suggests that the fribble may or may not have been snurgled, but there is no requirement for it to have been.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled\" from \"The fribble might not have been snurgled\". The first statement only implies the possibility of the fribble not being snurgled, while the second statement implies a lack of necessity or obligation for the fribble to have been snurgled.\n\nAnswer: No.",
