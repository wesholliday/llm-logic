The material implication can be represented as:\n\nA \u2192 B\n\nWhere A is \"the cake was chocolate\" and B is \"the muffins were not blueberry\".\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\", we need to determine if the converse of the original statement is true. The converse of the statement is:\n\nB \u2192 A\n\nWhere B is \"the muffins were blueberry\" and A is \"the cake was chocolate\".\n\nWe cannot infer the converse of the original statement from the given information. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
