If the vampire is awake, the mummy is not awake, and vice versa.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake\" from the given statement. This is because the statement only implies a correlation between the vampire and mummy's states of awareness, and does not imply a causal relationship between them.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No.",
