This is because the two statements are logically equivalent, and we can infer the second statement from the first by reversing the order of the clauses.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James' from 'If the book was written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
