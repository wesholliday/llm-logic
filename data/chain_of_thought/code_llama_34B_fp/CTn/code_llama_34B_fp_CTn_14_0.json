            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den'. This statement is in the form of a conditional, specifically a material implication. The material implication can be represented as a logical expression:\n\n(Bear \u2208 Cave) \u2192 (Wolf \u2209 Den)\n\nwhere Bear \u2208 Cave and Wolf \u2209 Den represent the statements \"the bear is in the cave\" and \"the wolf is not in the den\", respectively.\n\nTo infer 'If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave', we need to negate the antecedent (Bear \u2208 Cave) and the consequent (Wolf \u2209 Den), and then swap them. The negation of the antecedent is 'the bear is not in the cave', which can be represented as \u00ac(Bear \u2208 Cave). The negation of the consequent is 'the wolf is in the den', which can be represented as \u00ac(Wolf \u2209 Den).\n\nSo, the inferred statement can be represented as:\n\n(\u00ac(Bear \u2208 Cave)) \u2192 (\u00ac(Wolf \u2209 Den))\n\nThis statement is logically equivalent to:\n\n(Bear \u2209 Cave) \u2192 (Wolf \u2208 Den)\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
