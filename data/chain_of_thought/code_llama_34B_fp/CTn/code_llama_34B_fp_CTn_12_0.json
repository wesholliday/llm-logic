However, it does not provide any information about what Lucy did or did not do.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\" from the given statement. The statement only provides information about the relationship between Joe's actions and Lucy's actions, but it does not provide any information about Lucy's actions in isolation.\n\nAnswer: No.",
