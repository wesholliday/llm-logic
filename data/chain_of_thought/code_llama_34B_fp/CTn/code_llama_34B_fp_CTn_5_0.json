However, it does not imply that if Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nTo infer that \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball,\" we would need additional information or evidence to support this conclusion. For example, if we knew that Jeff and Amy are both athletic and have similar schedules, we might infer that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy would not have had the time or resources to play tennis. However, without this additional information, we cannot infer that if Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: No.",
