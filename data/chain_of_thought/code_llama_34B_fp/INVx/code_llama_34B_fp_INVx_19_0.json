If the smonk was vreebled, then it is likely that it plagged. However, the statement does not explicitly state that being vreebled is a necessary condition for plagging. It is possible that the smonk plagged for some other reason, even if it was not vreebled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk was not plagged\" from the given statement. It is possible that the smonk was not vreebled, but still plagged for some other reason.\n\nAnswer: No.",
