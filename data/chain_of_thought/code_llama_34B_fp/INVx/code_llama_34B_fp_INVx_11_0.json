This means that if the first statement is true, then the second statement must also be true.\n\nHowever, the converse of the first statement is not necessarily true. In other words, just because the flug was not blummed, it does not mean that the flug was not zimmed. There may be other factors that affect whether the flug is zimmed or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the flug was not blummed, then the flug was not zimmed\" from \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
