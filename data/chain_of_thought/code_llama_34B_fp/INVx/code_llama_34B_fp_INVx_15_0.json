            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\" This statement is in the form of a conditional, specifically a material implication. The material implication can be represented as a logical formula:\n\n(P \u2192 Q)\n\nWhere P is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and Q is \"the dreb was spened\".\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened\", we need to check if the contrapositive of the original statement is true. The contrapositive of a material implication is represented as:\n\n(\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP)\n\nWhere \u00acQ is \"the dreb was not spened\" and \u00acP is \"the dreb was not vroombed\".\n\nSubstituting the original statement into the contrapositive, we get:\n\n(\u00ac(the dreb was spened) \u2192 \u00ac(the dreb was vroombed))\n\nThis statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, and therefore, we can infer \"If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
