If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled. There could be other factors that caused the wug to be garpled, and the absence of sproinging does not necessarily imply the absence of garpling.\n\nAnswer: No.",
