            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\" This statement is in the form of a conditional, specifically a material conditional. The material conditional states that if a certain condition is met, then a certain outcome will occur. In this case, the condition is \"the sprocket was cranked,\" and the outcome is \"the sprocket was daggled.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"If the sprocket was not cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled\" from the given statement, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement implies that there is a causal relationship between the cranking of the sprocket and the daggling of the sprocket. If the sprocket is cranked, then it is likely that the sprocket will daggle. However, the first statement does not explicitly state that the sprocket will definitely daggle if it is cranked. There may be other factors that could prevent the sprocket from daggling, even if it is cranked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the sprocket was not cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled\" from the given statement. The first statement only implies a conditional relationship between the cranking of the sprocket and the daggling of the sprocket, and it does not guarantee that the sprocket will not daggle if it is not cranked.\n\nAnswer: No.",
