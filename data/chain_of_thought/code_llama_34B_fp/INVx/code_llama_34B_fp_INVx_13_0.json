In other words, if the glip was slogged, then it is likely that the glip was tragged as a result. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the glip was not slogged, then it was not tragged. There could be other factors that caused the glip to be tragged, or the glip could have been tragged for other reasons unrelated to whether it was slogged or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the glip was not slogged, then the glip was not tragged\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
