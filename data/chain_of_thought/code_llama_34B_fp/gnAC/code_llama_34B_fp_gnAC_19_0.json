            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis is a classic example of a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that uses a set of premises to reach a conclusion. In this case, the premises are \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" and \"Jen watched basketball.\" The conclusion is \"Tom watched football.\"\n\nTo determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises, we need to consider the meaning of the words \"if\" and \"then.\" In this context, \"if\" means \"if and only if\" (i.e., the two statements are equivalent), and \"then\" means \"implies.\"\n\nSo, the first premise can be rewritten as \"Tom watched football if and only if Jen watched basketball.\" This means that whenever Jen watches basketball, Tom will also watch football.\n\nThe second premise simply states that Jen watched basketball.\n\nNow, we can use these premises to determine whether the conclusion follows logically. If Jen watched basketball, then by the first premise, Tom must have watched football. Therefore, the conclusion \"Tom watched football\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
