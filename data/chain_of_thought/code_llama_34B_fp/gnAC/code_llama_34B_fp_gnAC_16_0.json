            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis is a classic example of a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that uses a set of premises to reach a conclusion. In this case, the premises are \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" and \"The pants were denim.\" The conclusion is \"The shirt was cotton.\"\n\nTo determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises, we need to examine the form of the argument. The argument is in the form of a material implication, which means that the conclusion logically follows from the premises if the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is true and the consequent (the \"then\" part) is false.\n\nIn this case, the antecedent is \"The shirt was cotton\" and the consequent is \"The pants were denim.\" If the shirt was cotton, then the pants would be denim, but the converse is not necessarily true. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the shirt was cotton based solely on the information that the pants were denim.\n\nAnswer: No.",
