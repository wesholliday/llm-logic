            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis is a classic example of a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement, which means that the truth of the consequent (Mark bought the blue shirt) does not necessarily determine the truth of the antecedent (Lisa bought the red shirt).\n\nIn this case, we are given that Mark bought the blue shirt, which is the consequent of the conditional statement. However, this does not mean that Lisa bought the red shirt, which is the antecedent of the conditional statement. Therefore, it does not necessarily follow that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: No.",
