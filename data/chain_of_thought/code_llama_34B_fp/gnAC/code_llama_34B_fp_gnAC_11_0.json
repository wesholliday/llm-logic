In this case, the premises are:\n\n1. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n2. The muffins were blueberry.\n\nThe conclusion that can be drawn from these premises is:\n\n3. The cake was chocolate.\n\nThe reasoning behind this conclusion is that the first premise states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would be blueberry.
