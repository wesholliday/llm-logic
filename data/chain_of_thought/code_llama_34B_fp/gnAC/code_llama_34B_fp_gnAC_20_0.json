            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis is a classic example of a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that uses a set of premises to reach a conclusion. In this case, the premises are \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" and \"The banana was yellow.\" The conclusion is \"The apple was red.\"\n\nTo determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises, we need to consider the form of the argument. In this case, the argument is of the form \"If A, then B; B; therefore, A.\" This is known as a hypothetical syllogism, and it is a valid form of argument.\n\nIn a hypothetical syllogism, the first premise is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\" The second premise is a statement of the form \"B.\" The conclusion is a statement of the form \"A.\" The argument is valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nIn this case, the conclusion \"The apple was red\" logically follows from the premises \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" and \"The banana was yellow.\" Therefore, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
