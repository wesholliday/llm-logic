            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis is a classic example of a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that uses a set of premises to reach a conclusion. In this case, we have two premises:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n2. The mummy was awake.\n\nFrom these premises, we can conclude that the vampire was awake. This is because the first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would also be awake. Since we know that the mummy was awake (based on the second premise), we can infer that the vampire must have been awake as well.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
