In this case, the premises are \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" and \"Bob chose pasta.\" The conclusion is \"Sue chose pizza.\"\n\nTo determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises, we need to examine the validity of the argument. A valid argument is one in which the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nIn this case, the argument is valid because the first premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement about the relationship between two things. The second premise is a statement about one of the things in the conditional statement. By combining these two premises, we can logically deduce the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
