            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis is a classic example of a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that uses a set of premises to reach a conclusion. In this case, the premises are \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" and \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" The conclusion is \"Joe went to the park.\"\n\nTo determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises, we need to consider the meaning of the words \"if\" and \"then.\" In this context, \"if\" means \"if and only if\" (i.e., the two statements are equivalent), and \"then\" means \"implies.\"\n\nSo, the first premise can be rewritten as \"Joe went to the park if and only if Lucy went to the zoo.\" This means that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy would not have gone to the zoo either.\n\nThe second premise simply states that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion. If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy would not have gone to the zoo, according to the first premise. But we know that Lucy did go to the zoo, according to the second premise. Therefore, it must be the case that Joe went to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
