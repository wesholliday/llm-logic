The scarf isn't draped on the coat rack.\n\nFrom these two pieces of information, we can infer that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack. This is because the first piece of information tells us that the scarf is either in my backpack or on the coat rack, and the second piece of information tells us that it is not on the coat rack. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the scarf is in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
