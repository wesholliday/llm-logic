The shoes aren't lined up by the door.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that the shoes are in the closet. This is because the first statement states that the shoes are either in the closet or lined up by the door, and the second statement rules out the possibility that the shoes are lined up by the door. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
