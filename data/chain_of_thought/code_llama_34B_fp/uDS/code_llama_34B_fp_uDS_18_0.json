The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer. This is because the first statement tells us that the notebook is either in the drawer or on the nightstand, but the second statement tells us that it is not on the nightstand. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
