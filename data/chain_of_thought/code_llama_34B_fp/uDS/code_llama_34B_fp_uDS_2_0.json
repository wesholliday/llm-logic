The book isn't resting on the table.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nTo do this, we need to analyze the premises and determine if they provide sufficient information to draw the desired conclusion.\n\nThe first premise states that the book is either on the shelf or it is resting on the table. This premise does not explicitly state that the book is on the shelf, but it does provide us with two possible locations for the book.\n\nThe second premise states that the book isn't resting on the table. This premise rules out one of the possible locations for the book, which is on the table.\n\nBased on the information provided in the premises, we can infer that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
