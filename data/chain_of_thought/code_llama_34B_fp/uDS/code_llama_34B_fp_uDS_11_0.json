The newspaper isn't sitting on the porch.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that the newspaper is in the driveway. This is because the first statement states that the newspaper is either in the driveway or on the porch, and the second statement rules out the possibility that it is on the porch. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, we can infer that the newspaper is in the driveway.",
