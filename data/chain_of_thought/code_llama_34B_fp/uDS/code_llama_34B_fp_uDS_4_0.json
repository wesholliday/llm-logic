The cat isn't playing in the bedroom.\n\nFrom these two pieces of information, we can infer that the cat is napping on the couch. This is because the first piece of information tells us that the cat is either napping on the couch or playing in the bedroom, and the second piece of information tells us that the cat isn't playing in the bedroom. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
