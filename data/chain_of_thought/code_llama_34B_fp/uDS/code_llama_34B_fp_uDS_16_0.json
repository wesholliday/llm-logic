The pen isn't on my desk.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer that the pen is in my bag. To do this, we need to analyze the premises and determine if they logically entail the conclusion.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first premise: \"The pen is either in my bag or on my desk.\" This premise states that the pen is in one of two possible locations: my bag or my desk.\n\nNext, let's consider the second premise: \"The pen isn't on my desk.\" This premise states that the pen is not in the location specified in the first premise, which is my desk.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion we want to draw: \"The pen is in my bag.\" This conclusion states that the pen is in the other possible location specified in the first premise, which is my bag.\n\nBased on the premises and the conclusion, we can see that the conclusion logically follows from the premises. If the pen is not on my desk, and it is either in my bag or on my desk, then it must be in my bag. Therefore, we can infer that the pen is in my bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
