The watch isn't on his wrist.\n\nFrom these two pieces of information, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser. This is because the first piece of information tells us that the watch is either charging on the dresser or on his wrist, and the second piece of information tells us that it is not on his wrist. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
