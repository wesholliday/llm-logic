This is because the statement \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" is a biconditional statement, meaning that both the antecedent and consequent are true, or both are false.\n\nIf the alien did not visit Mars, then the antecedent of the statement is false. Since the antecedent is false, the entire statement is false, and the consequent must also be false. Therefore, if the alien did not visit Mars, we can infer that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
