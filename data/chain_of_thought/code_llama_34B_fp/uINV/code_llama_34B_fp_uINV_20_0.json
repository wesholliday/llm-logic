            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis question is an example of a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that uses a set of premises to reach a conclusion. The premises in this case are \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" and \"The apple was not red.\" The conclusion is \"The banana was not yellow.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow, we need to consider the validity of the argument. A valid argument is one in which the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nIn this case, the argument is valid because the premises are true and the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises. The first premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. This means that the apple being red is a necessary condition for the banana being yellow. The second premise states that the apple was not red. This means that the apple was not in the state that is necessary for the banana to be yellow. Therefore, we can conclude that the banana was not yellow.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
