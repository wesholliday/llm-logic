            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis is a classic example of a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that uses a set of premises to reach a conclusion. The first premise is \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true, then the consequent (the part after the \"then\") must also be true.\n\nThe second premise is \"The car was not red.\" This premise is also a conditional statement, but it is negated, which means that the antecedent is false.\n\nUsing these two premises, we can conclude that the truck was not blue. This is because the first premise states that if the car was red, then the truck was blue, but the second premise states that the car was not red. Therefore, we can infer that the truck was not blue.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
