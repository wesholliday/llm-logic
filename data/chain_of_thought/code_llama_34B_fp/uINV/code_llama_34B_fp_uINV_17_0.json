            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis is a classic example of a logical inference question. To determine whether we can infer that if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This statement implies that there is a causal relationship between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating salad. In other words, if Ben eats pasta, then Kate will eat salad.\n\nThe second statement is \"Ben did not eat pasta.\" This statement implies that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nNow, let's consider the inference. If Ben did not eat pasta, then we can infer that Kate did not eat salad. This is because the first statement implies that if Ben eats pasta, then Kate will eat salad. Since Ben did not eat pasta, we can conclude that Kate did not eat salad.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
