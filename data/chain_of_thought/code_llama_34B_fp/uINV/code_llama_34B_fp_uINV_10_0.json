Biconditional statements are statements that are true if and only if both the antecedent and the consequent are true.\n\nIn this case, the antecedent is \"the dog was inside\" and the consequent is \"the cat was outside.\" If the dog was not inside, then the antecedent is false, and therefore the entire statement is false. Since the statement is false, we can infer that the cat was not outside.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
