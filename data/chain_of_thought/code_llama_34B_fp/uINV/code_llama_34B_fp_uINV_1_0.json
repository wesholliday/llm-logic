            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement. It implies that there is a causal relationship between Mary's attendance and Sue's attendance. However, it does not guarantee that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nFor example, if Mary was at the wedding because she was the maid of honor, and Sue was at the wedding because she was Mary's best friend, then if Mary was not at the wedding, it does not necessarily follow that Sue was not at the wedding. Sue may have attended the wedding for other reasons, such as being a close friend of the bride or groom.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No.",
