To do this, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement is \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This means that if Sam took a plane, it is guaranteed that Erin took a train. However, it does not mean that if Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane. There could be other factors at play that caused Erin to not take a train, even if Sam did take a plane.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train. The two statements are not logically connected in a way that would allow us to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No.",
