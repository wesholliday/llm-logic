Biconditional statements are statements that have two conditional statements connected by the word \"and.\" In this case, the two conditional statements are \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" and \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate.\"\n\nBiconditional statements are logically equivalent to each other, meaning that if one statement is true, then the other statement must also be true. Therefore, if we know that the cake was not chocolate, then we can infer that the muffins were not blueberry because the statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is false.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
