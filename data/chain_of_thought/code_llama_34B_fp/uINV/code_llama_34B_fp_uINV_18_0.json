It implies that there is a causal relationship between the doll being plastic and the truck being metal. However, it does not guarantee that the truck will not be metal if the doll is not plastic.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal. It is possible that the truck could still be metal even if the doll is not plastic.\n\nAnswer: No.",
