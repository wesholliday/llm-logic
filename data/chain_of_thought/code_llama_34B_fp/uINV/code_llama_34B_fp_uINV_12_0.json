To do this, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This statement is saying that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy also went to the zoo. However, it does not say anything about what would happen if Joe did not go to the park.\n\nThe second statement is \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\" This statement is saying that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy also did not go to the zoo. However, this statement is not necessarily true, as there is no logical connection between the two statements.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: No.",
