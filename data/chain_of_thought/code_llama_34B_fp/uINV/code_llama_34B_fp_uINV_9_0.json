It means that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then it is certain that Mark bought the blue shirt. However, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true, which means that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, it does not necessarily follow that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: No.",
