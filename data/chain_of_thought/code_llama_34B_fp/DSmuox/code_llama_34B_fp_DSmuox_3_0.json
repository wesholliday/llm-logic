This means that the splat is not necessarily quanked.\n\nSecond, we can assume that the statement \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked\" is also true. This means that either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the splat is not morphed. If the splat is not morphed, then it must be quanked according to the second premise. However, this contradicts the first premise, which states that the splat is not necessarily quanked. Therefore, we can conclude that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
