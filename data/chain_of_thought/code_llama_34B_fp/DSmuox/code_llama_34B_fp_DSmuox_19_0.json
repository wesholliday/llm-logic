The second premise, 'Either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged', means that if the smonk is not vreebled, then it must be plagged.\n\nSince we know that the smonk is not plagged (from the first premise), and we know that the smonk is either vreebled or plagged (from the second premise), we can conclude that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
