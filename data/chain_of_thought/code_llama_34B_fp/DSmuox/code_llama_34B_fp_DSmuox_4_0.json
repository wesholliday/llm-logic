This means that the fribble is not necessarily crinked.\n\nSecond, we can see that 'Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked' is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the options must be true. Since we have already established that the fribble is not necessarily crinked, we can infer that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that 'The fribble is snurgled' is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
