This means that the flob is not necessarily movated.\n\nSecond, we can see that 'Either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated' is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the options must be true. Since we have already established that the flob is not necessarily movated, the only remaining option is that the flob is skizzled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The flob is skizzled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
