However, this does not necessarily mean that both outcomes are possible. It is possible that the project might be completed early, but it is not necessarily the case that it might be late.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The project might be completed early and it might be late\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
