The premise only states that it is not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag, which means that they could be in her bag or not. The conclusion, however, states that the sunglasses might not be in her bag, which is a weaker statement than the premise. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
