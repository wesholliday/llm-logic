The premise only states that it's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars, which means that the alien could have visited Mars or not visited Mars. The conclusion, however, states that the alien might not have visited Mars, which is a weaker statement than the premise. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
