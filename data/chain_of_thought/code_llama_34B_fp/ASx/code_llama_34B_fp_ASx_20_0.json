This is because the statement \"If the plim is grobbled, then the whiffle will sploosh\" is a general statement that applies to any situation where the plim is grobbled. Adding the additional condition that the drazzle is drooped does not change the fact that the whiffle will sploosh if the plim is grobbled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
