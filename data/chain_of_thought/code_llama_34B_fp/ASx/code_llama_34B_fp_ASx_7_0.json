This is because the statement \"If the tizzer is on, then the goom is snurpled\" implies a causal relationship between the tizzer being on and the goom being snurpled. Since the plink light being out is not mentioned in the original statement, it does not affect the validity of the inference.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
