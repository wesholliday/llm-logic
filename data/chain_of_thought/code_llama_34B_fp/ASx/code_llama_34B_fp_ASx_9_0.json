This is because the statement \"If the ploofle is blorped, then the fliggle will get a nurple\" is a general statement that applies to all cases where the ploofle is blorped. Adding the additional condition that the ploofle is zooned does not change the fact that the fliggle will still get a nurple if the ploofle is blorped.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
