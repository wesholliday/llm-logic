This is because the original statement, \"If the frizzle is dinked, then the zarp will splunk,\" implies a causal relationship between the frizzle being dinked and the zarp splunking. Since the sklonk is not mentioned in the original statement, it does not affect the validity of the inference. Therefore, we can conclude that if the frizzle is dinked and the sklonk is grooped, then the zarp will splunk.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
