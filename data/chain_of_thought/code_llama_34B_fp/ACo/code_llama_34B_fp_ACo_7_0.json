The second statement, \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race,\" is a conditional statement that implies that if Alex finished the race, then Chris would have finished the race as well.\n\nSince we know that Chris finished the race, and the conditional statement implies that if Alex finished the race, then Chris would have finished the race, we can conclude that Alex must have finished the race as well. Therefore, the answer is yes, we can infer that Alex finishes the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
