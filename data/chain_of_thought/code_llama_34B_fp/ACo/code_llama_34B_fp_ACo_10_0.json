The second premise, 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside', is a conditional statement that implies that if the dog was inside, then the cat would be outside.\n\nSince we know that the cat was outside, and the second premise states that if the dog was inside, then the cat would be outside, we can infer that the dog was inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
