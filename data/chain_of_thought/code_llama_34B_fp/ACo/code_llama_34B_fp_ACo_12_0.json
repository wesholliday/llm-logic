The second premise, 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo', is a conditional statement that implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy would also have gone to the zoo.\n\nSince we are given that Lucy went to the zoo, and the only way for her to have gone to the zoo is if Joe went to the park, we can infer that Joe went to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
