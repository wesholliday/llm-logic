The banana was yellow.\n2. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the apple was red. This is because the second statement implies that the banana was yellow, and we know that the banana was yellow. Therefore, the only way to make the second statement true is if the apple was red.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
