The second premise, 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake', implies that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was also awake.\n\nFrom these two premises, we can conclude that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was also awake. However, we cannot infer that the vampire was awake simply based on the premises. Therefore, the answer is 'no'.\n\nAnswer: no",
