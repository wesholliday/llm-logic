In this case, we have two premises:\n\n1. If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n2. Chris finished the race.\n\nFrom these premises, we can conclude that Alex finished the race. This is because the first premise states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris would also finish the race. Since Chris did finish the race, we can infer that Alex must have finished the race as well.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
