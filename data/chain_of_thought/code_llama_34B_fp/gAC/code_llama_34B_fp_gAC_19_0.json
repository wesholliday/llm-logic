            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis is a classic example of a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that uses a set of premises to reach a conclusion. In this case, the premises are:\n\n1. If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n2. Jen watched basketball.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n3. Tom watched football.\n\nTo determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises, we need to examine the logical form of the argument. The first premise is an if-then statement, which is logically equivalent to \"not Tom watched football or Jen watched basketball.\" The second premise is simply \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can deduce that \"not Tom watched football\" is true. This is because the first premise implies that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen would watch basketball. Since Jen did watch basketball, it must be the case that Tom did not watch football.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Tom watched football\" is false.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, it does not follow that Tom watched football is true.",
