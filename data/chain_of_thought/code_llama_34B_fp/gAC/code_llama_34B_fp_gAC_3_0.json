            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis is a classic example of a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that uses a set of premises to reach a conclusion. In this case, the premises are:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n2. The book is a mystery novel.\n\nThe conclusion we want to draw is:\n\n3. The book was written by James.\n\nTo determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises, we need to consider the logical form of the argument. In this case, the argument is of the form \"All A are B. All B are C. Therefore, all A are C.\" This is known as a \"hypothetical syllogism.\"\n\nTo determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises, we need to consider whether the premises are logically consistent. In this case, the premises are logically consistent, so we can conclude that the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
