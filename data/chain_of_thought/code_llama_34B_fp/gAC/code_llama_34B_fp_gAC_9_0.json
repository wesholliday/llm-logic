In this case, the premises are:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n2. Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nThe conclusion that can be drawn from these premises is that Lisa bought the red shirt. This is because the first premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark would buy the blue shirt. Since Mark did buy the blue shirt, it must be the case that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
