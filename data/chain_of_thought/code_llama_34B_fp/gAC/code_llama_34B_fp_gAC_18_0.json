            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis is a classic example of a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that uses a set of premises to reach a conclusion. In this case, the premises are \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" and \"The truck was metal.\" The conclusion is \"The doll was plastic.\"\n\nTo determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises, we need to examine the logical form of the argument. The first premise is an if-then statement, which can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q,\" where \"P\" is \"The doll was plastic\" and \"Q\" is \"The truck was metal.\" The second premise is simply \"The truck was metal,\" which can be represented as \"Q.\"\n\nUsing these representations, we can write the argument as:\n\nP \u2192 Q\nQ\n\nThis argument is valid, which means that the conclusion follows logically from the premises. Therefore, we can conclude that \"The doll was plastic\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
