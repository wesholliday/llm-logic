Biconditional statements are statements that have two conditional statements connected by the word \"and.\" In this case, the two conditional statements are \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" and \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\"\n\nSince we know that the banana was yellow, we can infer that the apple was red because the two statements are connected by the word \"and.\" This means that if one statement is true, then the other statement must also be true. Therefore, if the banana was yellow, then the apple must have been red.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
