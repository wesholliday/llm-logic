The argument assumes that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train, and also assumes that Erin took a train. However, this does not necessarily mean that Sam took a plane. There could be other explanations for why Erin took a train, such as she could have taken a different plane or a bus. Therefore, we cannot infer that Sam took a plane.\n\nAnswer: No.",
