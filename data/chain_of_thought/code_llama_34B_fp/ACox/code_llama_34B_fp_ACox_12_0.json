The wug was bimmed.\n2. If the wug was flooped, then the wug was bimmed.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that the wug was bimmed. However, we cannot infer that the wug was flooped, because the second statement only implies that the wug was bimmed if it was flooped, but it does not state that the wug was flooped.\n\nAnswer: No.",
