This means that the fleeg is either bluttered or surned, but we don't know which one it is.\n\nThe second premise states that 'The fleeg is not surned'. This means that the fleeg is not surned, but we still don't know whether it is bluttered or not.\n\nFrom these two premises, we can conclude that the fleeg is bluttered. If the fleeg was not bluttered, then it would be surned, which contradicts the second premise. Therefore, the only possible conclusion is that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
