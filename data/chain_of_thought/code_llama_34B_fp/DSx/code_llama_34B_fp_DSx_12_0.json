This means that the smip cannot be both shripped and lupped at the same time.\n\nThe second premise states that the smip is not lupped. This means that the smip must be either shripped or not lupped.\n\nSince the smip is not lupped, it must be shripped. Therefore, we can infer 'The smip is shripped'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
