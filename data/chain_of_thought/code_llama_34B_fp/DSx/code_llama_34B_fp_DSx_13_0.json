This means that the glip is either slogged or tragged, but we don't know which one it is.\n\nThe second premise states that 'The glip is not tragged'. This means that the glip is not tragged, but we still don't know whether it is slogged or not.\n\nHowever, since we know that the glip is not tragged, and the only other option is that it is slogged, we can infer that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
