This means that the dreb cannot be both vroombed and spened at the same time.\n\nThe second premise states that the dreb is not spened. This means that the dreb must be either vroombed or not spened.\n\nSince the dreb is not spened, it must be vroombed. Therefore, we can infer 'The dreb is vroombed'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
