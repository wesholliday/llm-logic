This means that the zinger is either fraggled or smoogled, but we don't know which one it is.\n\nThe second premise states that 'The zinger is not smoogled'. This means that the zinger is not smoogled, but we don't know whether it is fraggled or not.\n\nFrom these two premises, we can conclude that the zinger is fraggled. If the zinger was smoogled, then it would be contradicting the second premise. Since it is not smoogled, it must be fraggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
