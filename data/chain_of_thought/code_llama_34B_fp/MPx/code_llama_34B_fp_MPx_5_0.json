The zinger was fraggled.\n\nWe can infer that the zinger was smoogled because the first statement implies a causal relationship between being fraggled and being smoogled. If the zinger was fraggled, then it must have been smoogled, according to the first statement. The second statement confirms that the zinger was indeed fraggled, which means that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
