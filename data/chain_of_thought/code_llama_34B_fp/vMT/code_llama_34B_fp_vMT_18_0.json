The second premise states that the truck was not metal. However, the conclusion does not logically follow from these premises. The conclusion states that the doll was not plastic, but it does not necessarily follow that the doll was not plastic because the truck was not metal. There could be other factors that led to the conclusion that the doll was not plastic, such as the doll being made of a different material altogether.\n\nAnswer: No",
