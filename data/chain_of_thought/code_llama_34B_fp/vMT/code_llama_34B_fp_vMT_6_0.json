The second premise states that Bob did not choose pasta. Therefore, we can conclude that Sue did not choose pizza. However, this conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The argument is based on a false assumption that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob would choose pasta. This assumption is not necessarily true, and the argument is therefore not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
