The first premise states that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. The second premise states that the robot did not visit Jupiter. However, this does not mean that the alien did not visit Mars. The conclusion is based on a false assumption that the robot's visit to Jupiter is the only way for the alien to visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: No",
