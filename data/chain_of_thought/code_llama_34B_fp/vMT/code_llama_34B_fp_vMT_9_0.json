The second premise states that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. Therefore, we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. However, this conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The premises only tell us that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark would have bought the blue shirt, but they do not tell us what Lisa did or did not do. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: No",
