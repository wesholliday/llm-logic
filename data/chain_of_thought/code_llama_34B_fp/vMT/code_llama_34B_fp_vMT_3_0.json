The first premise states that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. The second premise states that the book is not a mystery novel. However, the conclusion states that the book was not written by James, which does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nFor example, it is possible that the book was written by someone else who is not James, and it is not a mystery novel. In this case, the conclusion would be false, even though the premises are true. Therefore, this argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
