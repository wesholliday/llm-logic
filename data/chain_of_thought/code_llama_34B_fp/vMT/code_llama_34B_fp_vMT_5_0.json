The first premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis, but the second premise states that Amy did not play tennis. This means that the antecedent (Jeff playing basketball) is false, but the consequent (Amy playing tennis) is also false. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
