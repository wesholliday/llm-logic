However, it does not explicitly state that this is the case.\n\nTo infer that \"It might be that the snorkel is plonk and the snork is wibble,\" we would need additional information or evidence to support this conclusion. For example, if we were told that the snorkel and snork are two different things, and that they are both plonk and wibble, respectively, then we could infer that \"It might be that the snorkel is plonk and the snork is wibble.\" However, without this additional information, we cannot make this inference.\n\nAnswer: No.",
