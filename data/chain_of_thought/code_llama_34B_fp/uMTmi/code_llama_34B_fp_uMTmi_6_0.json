The statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\" is a logical consequence of the information provided, but it does not imply that Sue did not choose pizza. The statement \"Bob might not have chosen pasta\" does not contradict the first statement, as it is possible for Bob to have chosen pasta even if Sue chose pizza. Therefore, we cannot infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: No",
