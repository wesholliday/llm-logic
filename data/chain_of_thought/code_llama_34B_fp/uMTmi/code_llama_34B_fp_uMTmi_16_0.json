The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\" is a conditional statement, which means that it is possible for the pants to not be denim even if the shirt is cotton. The statement \"the pants might not have been denim\" also suggests that the pants could have been made of a different material, which further weakens the possibility that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: No.",
