The statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad\" is a conditional statement, which means that it is possible for Ben to eat pasta without Kate eating salad. The statement \"Kate might not have eaten salad\" does not contradict the first statement, as it is possible for Kate to not eat salad regardless of whether Ben eats pasta. Therefore, we cannot draw a conclusion about Ben's pasta consumption based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No",
