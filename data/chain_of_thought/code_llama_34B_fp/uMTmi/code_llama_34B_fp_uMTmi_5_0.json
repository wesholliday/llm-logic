The statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis\" is a conditional statement, which means that it is possible for Jeff to play basketball without Amy playing tennis. The statement \"Amy might not have played tennis\" does not contradict the first statement, as it is possible for Amy to have played tennis or not played tennis, regardless of whether Jeff played basketball. Therefore, we cannot draw a conclusion about Jeff's basketball playing based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No",
