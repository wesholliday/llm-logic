The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\" is a conditional statement, which means that it is possible for Tom to watch football without Jen watching basketball. The statement \"Jen might not have watched basketball\" does not contradict the first statement, as it is possible for Jen to not watch basketball even if Tom watches football. Therefore, we cannot draw a conclusion about Tom's behavior based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No",
