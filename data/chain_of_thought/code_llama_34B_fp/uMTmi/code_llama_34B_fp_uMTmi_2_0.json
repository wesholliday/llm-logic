The statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest\" is a logical consequence of the premise \"The unicorn might not have been in the forest.\" This means that the presence of the griffin in the forest is not necessarily implied by the fact that the unicorn might not have been in the forest. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: No.",
