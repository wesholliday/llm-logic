The statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside\" is a logical consequence of the premise \"The cat might not have been outside.\" However, this statement does not imply that the dog was not inside. It is possible that the dog was inside and the cat was outside, or that the dog was outside and the cat was inside. Therefore, we cannot infer that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: No.",
