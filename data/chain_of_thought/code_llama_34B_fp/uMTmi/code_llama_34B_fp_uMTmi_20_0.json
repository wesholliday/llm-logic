The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" is a logical consequence of the premise \"The apple was red.\" However, the premise \"The apple was red\" is not necessarily true, as we are also given the information \"The banana might not have been yellow.\" This means that the statement \"The apple was red\" is not necessarily true, and therefore we cannot infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: No.",
