The statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel\" is a logical consequence of the premise that James only writes mystery novels. However, the statement \"the book might not be a mystery novel\" does not contradict this premise, as it is possible for James to write other types of books in addition to mystery novels. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: No",
