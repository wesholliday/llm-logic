The statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry\" is a logical consequence of the premise \"The muffins might not have been blueberry.\" This means that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would have been blueberry, but it doesn't tell us anything about the actual flavor of the cake.\n\nAnswer: No.",
