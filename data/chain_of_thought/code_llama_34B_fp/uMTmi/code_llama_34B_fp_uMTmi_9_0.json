The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" implies that Lisa and Mark made complementary purchases, but it does not rule out the possibility that Lisa bought both shirts or that Mark bought neither shirt. The statement \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt\" does not provide any additional information that would allow us to infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: No.",
