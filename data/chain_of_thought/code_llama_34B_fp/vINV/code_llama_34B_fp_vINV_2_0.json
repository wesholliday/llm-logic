The premise \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" is not necessarily true. There is no inherent connection between the presence of a griffin and the presence of a unicorn in a forest. Therefore, the conclusion \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest\" cannot be logically deduced from the premise.\n\nAnswer: No.",
