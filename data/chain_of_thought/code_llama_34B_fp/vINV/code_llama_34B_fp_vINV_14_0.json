The premise \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" is not necessarily true, as there are many other factors that could have caused the wolf to be in the den, such as the wolf's own behavior or the presence of other animals in the area. Therefore, the conclusion \"If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den\" is not necessarily true, and the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
