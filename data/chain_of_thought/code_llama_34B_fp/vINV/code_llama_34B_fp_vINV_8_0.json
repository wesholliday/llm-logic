The premise \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is not necessarily true, as there is no inherent connection between the awakened state of a vampire and a mummy. Therefore, the conclusion \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake\" cannot be logically deduced from the premise.\n\nAnswer: No",
