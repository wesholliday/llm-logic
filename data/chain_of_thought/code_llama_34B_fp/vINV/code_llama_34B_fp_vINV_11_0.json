The premise only states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry, but it does not provide any information about what would happen if the cake was not chocolate. Therefore, we cannot conclude that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nAnswer: No.",
