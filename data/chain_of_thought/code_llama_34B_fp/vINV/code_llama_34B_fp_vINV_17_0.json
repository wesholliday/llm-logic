The rule of contraposition states that if a conditional statement is true, then the contrapositive of the statement is also true. In this case, the conditional statement is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad,\" and the contrapositive is \"If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad.\" Since the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
