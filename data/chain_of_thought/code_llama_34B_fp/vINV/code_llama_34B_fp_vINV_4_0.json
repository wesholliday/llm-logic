The premise and conclusion are not logically connected, and the conclusion does not follow from the premise.\n\nThe premise states that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. This means that the alien's visit to Mars is a necessary condition for the robot's visit to Jupiter. However, the conclusion states that if the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter. This means that the alien's non-visit to Mars is a sufficient condition for the robot's non-visit to Jupiter.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because it is based on a false assumption that the alien's visit to Mars is a necessary and sufficient condition for the robot's visit to Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: No.",
