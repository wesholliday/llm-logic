            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis argument is logically valid because it follows the rule of contraposition. The rule of contraposition states that if a conditional statement is true, then the contrapositive of the statement is also true. In this case, the argument's premise is 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo', and the conclusion is 'If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo'. The contrapositive of the premise is 'If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park', which is the same as the conclusion. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
