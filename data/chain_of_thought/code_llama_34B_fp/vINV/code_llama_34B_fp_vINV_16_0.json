            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis argument is logically valid because it follows the rule of contraposition. The rule of contraposition states that if a conditional statement is true, then the contrapositive of the statement is also true. In this case, the argument's premise is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim', and the conclusion is 'If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim'. The contrapositive of the premise is 'If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton', which is logically equivalent to the conclusion. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
