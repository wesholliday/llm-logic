It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer 'The missing sock is in the laundry basket' from these premises.\n\nTo do this, we need to consider the possible cases:\n\nCase 1: The missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is true, and the second premise is irrelevant. Therefore, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nCase 2: The missing sock is under the bed.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is false, and the second premise is true. Therefore, we cannot infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nIn conclusion, we can infer 'The missing sock is in the laundry basket' only if the first premise is true, which means that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
