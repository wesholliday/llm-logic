This means that if the book is not resting on the table, it must be on the shelf.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table. This means that the book is not resting on the table.\n\nTherefore, based on the first premise, if the book is not resting on the table, it must be on the shelf. And since the book is not resting on the table (as per the second premise), it must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
