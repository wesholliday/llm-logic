This means that if the toy is not sitting on the bookshelf, it must be in the toy box.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf. This means that the toy is not sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nTherefore, based on the first premise, if the toy is not sitting on the bookshelf, it must be in the toy box. And since the toy is not sitting on the bookshelf (as per the second premise), it must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
