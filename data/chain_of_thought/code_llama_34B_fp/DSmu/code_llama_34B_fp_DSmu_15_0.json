This means that if the shoes are not in the closet, they must be lined up by the door.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door. This means that the shoes are not lined up by the door.\n\nSince the shoes are not lined up by the door and the first premise states that either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door, we can conclude that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
