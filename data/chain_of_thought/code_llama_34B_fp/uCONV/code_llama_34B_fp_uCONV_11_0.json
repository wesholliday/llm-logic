It implies that there is a causal relationship between the cake being chocolate and the muffins being blueberry. However, it does not provide any information about the causal relationship in the opposite direction.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate. The causal relationship may not be the same in both directions, and there may be other factors that influence the type of cake and muffins.\n\nAnswer: No.",
