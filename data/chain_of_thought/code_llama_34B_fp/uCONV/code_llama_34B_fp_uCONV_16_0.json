It implies that there is a causal relationship between the type of shirt and the type of pants. However, it does not guarantee that the causal relationship is two-way. In other words, just because the pants were denim does not necessarily mean that the shirt was cotton.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton.\n\nAnswer: No.",
