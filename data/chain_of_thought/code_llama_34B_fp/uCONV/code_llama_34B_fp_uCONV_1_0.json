It implies that there is a causal relationship between Mary's presence at the wedding and Sue's presence at the wedding. However, it does not guarantee that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was also at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No.",
