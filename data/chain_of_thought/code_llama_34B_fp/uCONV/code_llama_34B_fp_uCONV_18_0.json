It implies that there is a causal relationship between the doll being plastic and the truck being metal. However, it does not guarantee that the causal relationship is reciprocal, meaning that just because the truck was metal, it does not necessarily follow that the doll was plastic.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: No.",
