    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crinel, a nafiz, and a tomul are competing to be snarggle of next year's laggle team. The crinel is considered the frontrunner for snarggle, followed by the nafiz, while the tomul is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates, if the nafiz isn\u2019t named snarggle, then if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle. Moreover, the crinel likely will be named snarggle and hence the nafiz likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis is a classic example of a syllogism, a type of logical argument that uses a set of premises to reach a conclusion. The premises are:\n\n1. If the nafiz isn't named snarggle, then if the crinel isn't named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle.\n2. The crinel is considered the frontrunner for snarggle, followed by the nafiz.\n\nFrom these premises, we can conclude that it is likely that if the crinel isn't named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle. This is because the nafiz is a long shot, and if they are not named snarggle, then the crinel is the next most likely candidate to be named snarggle. If the crinel is not named snarggle, then the tomul is the next most likely candidate, and therefore it is likely that the tomul will be named snarggle.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
