    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a vringlet, a crappen, and a strorvil are shortlisted for the Liggerton Award in bloffu this year. Bloffu critics regard the vringlet as the front runner, followed by the crappen, while the strorvil is a heavy underdog. Since these are the only finalists under consideration, if the crappen doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the vringlet doesn\u2019t win, the strorvil will win. Moreover, the vringlet likely will win the award and hence the crappen likely won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the vringlet doesn\u2019t win the Liggerton Award, the strorvil will?",

If the vringlet doesn't win the award, it is likely that the crappen will not win either, since it is a heavy underdog. Therefore, if the vringlet doesn't win, the strorvil, which is the only other finalist, will likely win the award.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
