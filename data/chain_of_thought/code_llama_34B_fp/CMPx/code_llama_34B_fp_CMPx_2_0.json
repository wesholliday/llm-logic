    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect are applying for one open zulision. The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

The question assumes that if the jantiz doesn't get the zulision, then the sulect will, but this is not necessarily true.\n\nThe question is based on the assumption that the jantiz is the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, and then the sulect. However, this does not necessarily mean that the jantiz will get the zulision. It is possible that the cramen could also be a strong candidate and may have a better chance of getting the zulision.\n\nTherefore, it is not necessarily true that if the jantiz doesn't get the zulision, the sulect will. It is possible that the cramen could also be a strong candidate and may have a better chance of getting the zulision.\n\nAnswer: No.",
