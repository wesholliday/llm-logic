    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantug, a loperit, and a frallon are shortlisted for Blither of the Year. Industry watchers consider the fantug the front runner, followed by the loperit, while the frallon is a heavy underdog. Since these are the only products in contention, if the loperit doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the fantug doesn\u2019t win, the frallon will win. Moreover, the fantug likely will win the award and hence the loperit likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantug doesn't win Blither of the Year, the frallon will?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis question is asking us to determine whether it's likely that the frallon will win Blither of the Year if the fantug doesn't win. To answer this question, we need to consider the information provided in the question.\n\nFirstly, we know that the fantug is considered the front runner for Blither of the Year, which means that it is the most likely candidate to win the award. If the fantug doesn't win, then the loperit is the next most likely candidate to win, as it is considered the second most likely candidate.\n\nSecondly, we know that the frallon is a heavy underdog, which means that it is unlikely to win the award. However, if the loperit doesn't win, then the frallon is the only other product in contention, which means that it is more likely to win than if the loperit were still in the running.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it is likely that if the fantug doesn't win Blither of the Year, the frallon will.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
