    "user_prompt": "Suppose a fantole, a dribban, and a snorpul have the best odds to win this season's Rizzle Cup. Oddsmakers believe it's most probable the fantole will capture the cup, followed by the dribban, while the snorpul is a heavy longshot. Since these are the only top contenders, if the dribban doesn\u2019t win the cup, then if the fantole doesn\u2019t win, the snorpul will win. Moreover, the fantole likely will win the cup and hence the dribban likely won't win. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantole doesn't win the Rizzle Cup, the snorpul will?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe question is asking whether it is likely that the snorpul will win the Rizzle Cup if the fantole doesn't win. To answer this question, we need to consider the information provided in the question.\n\nFirstly, the oddsmakers believe that the fantole has the best odds to win the Rizzle Cup, followed by the dribban, and the snorpul is a heavy longshot. This means that the fantole is the most likely to win the cup, and the dribban is the second most likely.\n\nSecondly, if the dribban doesn't win the cup, then the fantole is likely to win it. This is because the dribban is the second most likely to win the cup, and if they don't win, the fantole is the most likely to win.\n\nLastly, if the fantole doesn't win the cup, the snorpul will win it. This is because the snorpul is a heavy longshot, and if the fantole and dribban don't win the cup, the snorpul is the only other top contender.\n\nBased on this information, it is likely that if the fantole doesn't win the Rizzle Cup, the snorpul will win it. This is because the fantole is the most likely to win the cup, and if they don't win, the snorpul is the next most likely to win.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
