    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crastin, a nivet, and a jomial are the top bispets this breeding season. Breeders expect the crastin likely will birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, with the jomial birthing many fewer. These lead in birthing, so if the nivet doesn\u2019t birth the most offspring, then if the crastin doesn\u2019t, the jomial will. Moreover, the crastin likely will lead births and hence the nivet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the crastin doesn\u2019t lead births, the jomial will?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe question is asking whether it is likely that the jomial will lead births if the crastin does not lead births. To answer this question, we need to consider the information provided in the passage.\n\nFirst, we know that the crastin, nivet, and jomial are the top bispets this breeding season. This means that they are the most successful breeders.\n\nSecond, we know that the crastin is expected to birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, with the jomial birthing many fewer. This means that the crastin is the most likely to lead births.\n\nThird, we know that if the nivet doesn't birth the most offspring, then the jomial will. This means that the jomial is the next most likely to lead births after the crastin.\n\nFinally, we know that the crastin likely will lead births and hence the nivet likely won't. This means that if the crastin doesn't lead births, then the jomial is the most likely to lead births.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
