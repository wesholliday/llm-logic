    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a garplex, a beelhet, and a peedonk are competing to be domer of the year. Experts think the garplex is most likely to win, followed closely by the beelhet, with the peedonk having a much lower chance. Since these are the only domer candidates, if the beelhet doesn\u2019t become domer, then if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will become domer. Moreover, it is likely the garplex will become domer and hence the beelhet likely won\u2019t become domer. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis question is asking us to determine the likelihood of the peedonk becoming domer of the year, given the information provided.\n\nFirst, we can note that the experts think the garplex is most likely to win, followed closely by the beelhet. This means that the garplex has a high chance of becoming domer, and the beelhet has a lower chance.\n\nNext, we can consider the statement that if the beelhet doesn\u2019t become domer, then if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will become domer. This means that if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk is the next most likely candidate to become domer.\n\nFinally, we can consider the statement that it is likely the garplex will become domer, and hence the beelhet likely won\u2019t become domer. This means that the garplex has a high chance of becoming domer, and the beelhet has a low chance.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, it is likely that if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will become domer.",
