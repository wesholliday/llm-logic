    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantole, a dribban, and a cruggit are the most downloaded fillip apps this month. Market watchers expect the fantole likely will retain the top spot in downloads, followed by the dribban, with the cruggit download rate significantly lower. These lead the downloads, so if the dribban isn\u2019t the most downloaded, then if the fantole isn\u2019t, the cruggit will be. Moreover, the fantole likely will lead downloads and hence the dribban likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fantole isn\u2019t the most downloaded, the cruggit will be?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe question is asking whether it is likely that the cruggit will be the most downloaded app if the fantole is not the most downloaded. To answer this question, we need to consider the information provided in the passage.\n\nFirstly, the fantole, dribban, and cruggit are the most downloaded fillip apps this month. This means that the fantole is likely to retain the top spot in downloads, followed by the dribban.\n\nSecondly, the passage states that the dribban is expected to retain the second spot in downloads, with the cruggit download rate significantly lower. This means that the dribban is likely to be the second most downloaded app, and the cruggit is likely to be the third most downloaded app.\n\nLastly, the passage states that the fantole likely will lead downloads and hence the dribban likely won\u2019t. This means that the fantole is likely to be the most downloaded app, and the dribban is unlikely to be the most downloaded app.\n\nBased on the information provided, it is likely that if the fantole is not the most downloaded app, the cruggit will be. This is because the cruggit is expected to have a significantly lower download rate than the dribban, and the dribban is unlikely to be the most downloaded app. Therefore, it is likely that the cruggit will be the most downloaded app if the fantole is not the most downloaded app.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
