    "user_prompt": "Suppose a stribben, a vanoon, and a jentapp are applying to rent a bondle. The owner thinks the stribben is the strongest applicant, followed by the vanoon, while the jentapp seems much less qualified to rent a bondle. Since these are the only applicants, if the vanoon isn\u2019t selected, then if the stribben isn\u2019t selected, the jentapp will be selected. Moreover, the stribben likely will be chosen and hence the vanoon likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the stribben isn\u2019t selected to rent the bondle, the jentapp will be?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given that the owner thinks the stribben is the strongest applicant, followed by the vanoon, while the jentapp seems much less qualified to rent a bondle. This means that the owner is more likely to choose the stribben or the vanoon over the jentapp.\n\nWe also know that if the vanoon isn't selected, then the jentapp will be selected. This means that if the vanoon is not chosen, the jentapp is the next best option for the owner.\n\nHowever, we are also given that the stribben likely will be chosen and hence the vanoon likely won't be. This means that the owner is more likely to choose the stribben over the vanoon.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Does it follow that it's likely that, if the stribben isn't selected to rent the bondle, the jentapp will be?\n\nWe can see that the owner is more likely to choose the stribben over the vanoon, and if the vanoon isn't selected, the jentapp will be selected. However, we cannot conclude that it's likely that the jentapp will be selected if the stribben isn't selected. This is because the owner may choose the vanoon over the jentapp, even if the stribben isn't selected.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no. It doesn't follow that it's likely that, if the stribben isn't selected to rent the bondle, the jentapp will be.",
