In this case, the premises are:\n\n1. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n2. Jeff played basketball.\n\nThe conclusion we can draw from these premises is that Amy played tennis. This is because the first premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis, and the second premise states that Jeff did play basketball. Therefore, we can infer that Amy played tennis.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
