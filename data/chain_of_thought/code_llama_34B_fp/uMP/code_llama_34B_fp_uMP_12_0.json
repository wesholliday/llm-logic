Joe went to the park.\n\nFrom these two pieces of information, we can conclude that Lucy went to the zoo. This is because the first piece of information states that if Joe goes to the park, then Lucy goes to the zoo. Since we know that Joe did go to the park (from the second piece of information), we can infer that Lucy must have gone to the zoo as well.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
