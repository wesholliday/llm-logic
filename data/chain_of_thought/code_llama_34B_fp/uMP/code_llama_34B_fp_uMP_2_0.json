The first premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. The second premise states that the griffin was in the forest.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the unicorn was in the forest, we need to evaluate the strength of the argument. In this case, the argument is valid, which means that the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
