The second premise, \"Chris might not have finished the race,\" states that there is a possibility that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nFrom these two premises, we can conclude that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race, but we cannot conclude that Alex did not finish the race. Therefore, we cannot infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: No.",
