The wolf might not have been in the den.\n\nFrom these statements, we can conclude that the bear might not have been in the cave. This is because the first statement implies that the bear was in the cave, but the second statement suggests that the wolf might not have been in the den. If the wolf was not in the den, then it is possible that the bear was not in the cave either.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
