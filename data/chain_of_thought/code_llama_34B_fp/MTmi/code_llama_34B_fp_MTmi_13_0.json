Specifically, if the car is red, then the truck must be blue.\n\nThe statement \"The truck might not have been blue\" suggests that there is some uncertainty about the color of the truck. It does not necessarily contradict the first statement, as it is possible that the truck was not blue even if the car was red.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The car was not red\" from the given statements. The first statement implies that the car was red, and the second statement does not provide enough information to contradict this inference.\n\nAnswer: No.",
