However, this does not mean that the alien did not visit Mars. It only means that if the alien did visit Mars, the robot must have visited Jupiter.\n\nThe second premise 'The robot might not have visited Jupiter' does not provide any information about the alien's visit to Mars. It only implies that the robot might not have visited Jupiter, but it does not provide any information about the alien's visit to Mars.\n\nTherefore, we can't infer 'The alien did not visit Mars' from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
