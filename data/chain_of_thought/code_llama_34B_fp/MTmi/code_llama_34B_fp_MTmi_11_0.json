However, the statement \"The muffins might not have been blueberry\" suggests that there is some uncertainty or possibility that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nWhen we combine these two statements, we can infer that the cake might not have been chocolate. This is because the causal relationship between the cake being chocolate and the muffins being blueberry is not guaranteed, and there is a possibility that the muffins were not blueberry. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that the cake was chocolate.\n\nAnswer: No.",
