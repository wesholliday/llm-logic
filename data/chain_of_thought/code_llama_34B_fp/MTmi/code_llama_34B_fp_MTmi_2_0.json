            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statements can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest (G \u2192 U)\n2. The unicorn might not have been in the forest (\u00acU)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The griffin was not in the forest\" (\u00acG) from these statements.\n\nTo do this, we can use logical reasoning to see if the premises imply the conclusion.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the first premise using material implication:\n\nG \u2192 U \u2261 \u00acG \u2228 U\n\nNow, we can use the second premise to eliminate the disjunct \u00acU:\n\n\u00acG \u2228 U \u2227 \u00acU \u2261 \u00acG \u2227 \u00acU\n\nFinally, we can use De Morgan's laws to rewrite the conjunction as a negation:\n\n\u00ac(G \u2227 U) \u2261 \u00acG \u2228 \u00acU\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The griffin was not in the forest\" (\u00acG) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
