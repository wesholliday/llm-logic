Bob might not have chosen pasta.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza. This is because if Sue had chosen pizza, then Bob would have had to choose pasta, but since Bob might not have chosen pasta, it is impossible for Sue to have chosen pizza. Therefore, the only possible conclusion is that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
