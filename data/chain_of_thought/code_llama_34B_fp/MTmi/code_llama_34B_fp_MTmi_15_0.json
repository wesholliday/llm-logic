Erin might not have taken a train.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane. This is because the first statement implies that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. However, the second statement suggests that Erin might not have taken a train. If Erin did not take a train, then the first statement is not true, which means that Sam did not take a plane either.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
