Jen might not have watched basketball.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that Tom did not watch football. Here's why:\n\nIf Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball (statement 1). However, since Jen might not have watched basketball (statement 2), it means that Tom did not watch football.
