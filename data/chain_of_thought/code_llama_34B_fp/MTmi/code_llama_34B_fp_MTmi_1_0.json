If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding (M \u2192 S)\n4. Sue might not have been at the wedding (\u00acS)\n\nFrom the given statements, we can conclude that:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding (M \u2192 S)\n2. Sue might not have been at the wedding (\u00acS)\n\nWe cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding (\u00acM) from these statements. The first statement implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. The second statement implies that Sue might not have been at the wedding. However, it does not provide any information about Mary's attendance at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No.",
