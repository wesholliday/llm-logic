It implies that the presence of the griffin in the forest is a necessary condition for the presence of the unicorn in the forest. However, it does not imply that the absence of the griffin in the forest is a sufficient condition for the absence of the unicorn in the forest.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
