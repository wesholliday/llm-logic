            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is a conditional statement. It implies that there is a causal relationship between the doll being plastic and the truck being metal. However, it does not necessarily imply that the doll being plastic is the only cause of the truck being metal. There could be other factors that contribute to the truck being metal.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal\" from the given statement. The absence of a causal relationship between the doll being plastic and the truck being metal does not necessarily mean that the truck is not metal. There could be other factors that contribute to the truck being metal.\n\nAnswer: No.",
