This statement implies that there is a causal relationship between Sam taking a plane and Erin taking a train. However, it does not imply that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\n\nFor example, it is possible that Erin took a train regardless of whether Sam took a plane or not. In this case, the statement 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' would be true, but the statement 'If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train' would be false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
