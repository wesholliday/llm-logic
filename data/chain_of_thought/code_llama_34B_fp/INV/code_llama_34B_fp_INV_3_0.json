If the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. However, this does not mean that if the book was not written by James, then it is not a mystery novel. There could be other factors that determine the genre of the book, such as the content or the intended audience.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the book was not written by James, then it is not a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: No.",
