However, it does not imply that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nTo infer that \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo,\" we would need additional information or evidence that suggests a direct causal relationship between Joe's action and Lucy's action. Without this additional information, we cannot make a logical inference that one event causes the other.\n\nAnswer: No.",
