However, it does not imply that the dog being inside is the sole cause of the cat being outside. There may be other factors that contribute to the cat being outside, such as the cat being let out by someone else.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside\" from the given statement. The absence of the dog being inside does not necessarily mean that the cat is not outside.\n\nAnswer: No.",
