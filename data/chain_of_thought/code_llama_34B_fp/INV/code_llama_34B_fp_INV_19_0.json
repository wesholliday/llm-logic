However, it does not imply that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nTo infer that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball, we would need additional information or evidence. For example, if we knew that Tom and Jen have a close relationship and that Tom's football watching habits influence Jen's basketball watching habits, then we could infer that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nHowever, without additional information or evidence, we cannot infer that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nAnswer: No.",
