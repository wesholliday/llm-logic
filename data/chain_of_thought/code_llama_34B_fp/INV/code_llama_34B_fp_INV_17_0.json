However, it does not imply that if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad.\n\nFor example, it is possible that Kate always eats salad regardless of whether Ben eats pasta or not. In this case, the statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" would be true, but the statement \"If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad\" would be false.\n\nAnswer: No.",
