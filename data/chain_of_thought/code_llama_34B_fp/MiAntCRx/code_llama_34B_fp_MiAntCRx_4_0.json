As a noun, it refers to a minor or trivial argument or dispute, while as a verb, it means to argue or dispute about something in a minor or trivial way.\n\nIn the given sentence, \"The zizz might be quibble,\" \"quibble\" is used as a noun, suggesting that the speaker is referring to a minor or trivial argument or dispute. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that \"The zizz might be blurble and quibble\" because \"blurble\" is another word that can be used to refer to a minor or trivial argument or dispute, and \"and\" is used to indicate that the speaker is referring to two or more things.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
