It states that if the frazzle is not snork with gribble, then it must be on an blimple grooble.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The frazzle must be on an blimple grooble,\" we need to consider the possibility that the frazzle is not snork with gribble. If the frazzle is not snork with gribble, then it must be on an blimple grooble, according to the given statement.
