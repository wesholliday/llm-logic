The statement is not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a humorous observation about the similarity in sound between the two words.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The grazzle must be frazzle\" based on this statement. The statement is simply a play on words and does not provide any meaningful information about the grazzle's nature.\n\nAnswer: No.",
