This could be due to various reasons such as weather conditions, mechanical issues, or other unforeseen circumstances.\n\nHowever, the statement does not necessarily imply that the flight was rescheduled. It is possible that the flight was delayed, but not rescheduled, and that the passengers were simply waiting for the flight to depart at the originally scheduled time.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The flight must have been delayed or rescheduled\" from the statement \"The flight must have been delayed\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
