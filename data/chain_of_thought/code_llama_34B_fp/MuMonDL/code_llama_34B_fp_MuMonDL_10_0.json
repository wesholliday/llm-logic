The word \"signed\" can refer to a variety of actions, such as signing one's name, initialing a form, or even signing a document electronically.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the document has been approved based solely on the fact that it has been signed. It is possible that the document has been signed but not approved, or that it has been approved but not signed.\n\nAnswer: No.",
