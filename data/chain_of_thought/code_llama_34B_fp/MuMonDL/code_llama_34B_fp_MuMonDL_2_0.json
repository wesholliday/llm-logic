However, it does not necessarily mean that the book is on the shelf specifically, as it could be on a different shelf or in a different location within the library.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the book must be on the shelf or in the library. The statement only implies that the book is not in any other location, and it does not provide any information about the location of the book within the library.\n\nAnswer: No.",
