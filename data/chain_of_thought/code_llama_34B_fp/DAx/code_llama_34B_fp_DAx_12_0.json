The smip was not shripped (S2)\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that the smip did not lup the zoint. This is because the first statement implies that if the smip was shripped, then it would have luped the zoint. However, since we know that the smip was not shripped, we can conclude that it did not lup the zoint.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
