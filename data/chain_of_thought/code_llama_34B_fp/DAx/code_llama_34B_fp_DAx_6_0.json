The grommet was not sploffed.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"The grommet did not plop the frink,\" we need to analyze the logical relationship between the given statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true, then the consequent (the part after the \"then\") must also be true. In this case, the antecedent is \"the grommet was sploffed,\" and the consequent is \"the grommet plopped the frink.\"\n\nThe second statement simply states that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nNow, let's consider the inference we want to make: \"The grommet did not plop the frink.\" This statement is the negation of the consequent of the first statement. In other words, if the grommet did not plop the frink, then it must be the case that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer \"The grommet did not plop the frink\" from the given statements. The reason is that the first statement only implies that if the grommet was sploffed, then it plopped the frink. It does not say anything about what happens if the grommet is not sploffed. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the grommet did not plop the frink based solely on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No.",
