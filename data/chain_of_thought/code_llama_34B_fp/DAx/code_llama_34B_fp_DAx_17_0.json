This means that if the antecedent (the first part of the statement) is true, then the consequent (the second part of the statement) must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the antecedent \"the flob was skizzled\" is false, because we are given that the flob was not skizzled. Therefore, the consequent \"the flob movated\" must also be false, because it is logically implied by the antecedent.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
