This means that the only remaining possibility is that the remote control is on the coffee table, which is what the second premise, \"Either the remote control is hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table,\" states. Therefore, we can logically infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
