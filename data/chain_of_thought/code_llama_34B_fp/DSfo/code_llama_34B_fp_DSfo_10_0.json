The second statement, \"Either the missing sock is under the bed or it's in the laundry basket,\" provides two options for the location of the missing sock, but we have already eliminated one of those options. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
