The second statement, \"Either the umbrella is tucked away in the closet or it is in the car,\" provides two options for the location of the umbrella. Since we have already established that the umbrella is not in the closet, the only remaining option is that it is in the car. Therefore, we can infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
