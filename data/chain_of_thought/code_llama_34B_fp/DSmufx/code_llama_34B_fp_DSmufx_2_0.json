This means that the wug is either bimmed or flooped, but we don't know which one it is.\n\nThe second premise states that 'It's not the case that the wug must be bimmed'. This means that the wug is not bimmed.\n\nSince the wug is not bimmed and the first premise states that the wug is either bimmed or flooped, we can conclude that the wug is flooped.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
