This premise states that the splat must be quanked or it is morphed. It does not specify which one is true, but it implies that at least one of the options is true.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise: 'It's not the case that the splat must be quanked'. This premise states that the splat must not be quanked.\n\nFrom these two premises, we can conclude that the splat is morphed. If the splat must be quanked, then it cannot be morphed, as these are mutually exclusive options. Since we have established that the splat must be quanked, and we have also established that it is not quanked, we can infer that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
