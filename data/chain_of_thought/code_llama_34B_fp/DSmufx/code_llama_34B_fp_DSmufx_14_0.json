This means that if the clug is not snugged, it must be fleeked.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the clug must be snugged. This means that the clug is not snugged.\n\nSince the clug is not snugged and the first premise states that either the clug must be snugged or it is fleeked, we can conclude that the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
