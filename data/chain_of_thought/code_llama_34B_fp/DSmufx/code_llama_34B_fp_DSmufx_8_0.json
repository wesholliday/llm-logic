This means that the sprocket is either daggled or cranked, but we don't know which one it is.\n\nThe second premise states that 'It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled'. This means that the sprocket is not daggled.\n\nSince the sprocket is not daggled, and the only other option is that it is cranked, we can infer that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
