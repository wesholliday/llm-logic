This means that the flugel is either zargled or blimmed, but we don't know which one it is.\n\nThe second premise states that 'It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled'. This means that the flugel is not zargled.\n\nSince the flugel is not zargled and the first premise states that it is either zargled or blimmed, we can conclude that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
