This means that the smonk is either plagged or vreebled, but we don't know which one it is.\n\nThe second premise states that 'It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged'. This means that the smonk is not plagged.\n\nSince the smonk is not plagged, and the only other option is that it is vreebled, we can infer that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
