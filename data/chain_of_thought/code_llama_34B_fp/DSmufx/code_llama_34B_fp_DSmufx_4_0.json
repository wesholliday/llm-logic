This means that the fribble is either crinked or snurgled, but we don't know which one it is.\n\nThe second premise states that 'It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked'. This means that the fribble is not crinked.\n\nSince the fribble is not crinked and the only other option is that it is snurgled, we can infer that 'The fribble is snurgled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
