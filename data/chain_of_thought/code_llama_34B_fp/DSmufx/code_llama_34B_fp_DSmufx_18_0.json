This means that the shank is either nugged or plooked, but we don't know which one it is.\n\nThe second premise states that 'It's not the case that the shank must be nugged'. This means that the shank is not nugged.\n\nSince the shank is not nugged, and the only other option is that it is plooked, we can infer that the shank is plooked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
