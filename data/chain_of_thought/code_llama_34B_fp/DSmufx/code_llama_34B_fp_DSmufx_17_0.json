This means that if the flob is not movated, it must be skizzled.\n\nThe second premise states that 'It's not the case that the flob must be movated'. This means that the flob is not movated.\n\nSince the flob is not movated and the first premise states that if the flob is not movated, it must be skizzled, we can conclude that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
