This means that the zinger is either smoogled or fraggled, but we don't know which one it is.\n\nThe second premise states that 'It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled'. This means that the zinger is not smoogled.\n\nSince the zinger is not smoogled and the first premise states that the zinger is either smoogled or fraggled, we can conclude that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
