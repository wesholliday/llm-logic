This means that the sneg is either sproted or crampled, but we don't know which one it is.\n\nThe second premise states that 'It's not the case that the sneg must be sproted'. This means that the sneg is not sproted.\n\nSince the sneg is not sproted and the only other option is that it is crampled, we can infer that 'The sneg is crampled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
