This means that the wug is either garpled or sproinged, but we don't know which one it is.\n\nSecond, the second premise states that it's not the case that the wug must be garpled. This means that the wug is not garpled, but we still don't know whether it is sproinged or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can conclude that the wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
