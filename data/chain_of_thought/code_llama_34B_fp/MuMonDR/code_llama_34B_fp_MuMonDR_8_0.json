This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as the restaurant being closed for renovations, the restaurant being closed for a holiday, or the restaurant being closed for limited hours.\n\nHowever, it is not necessarily the case that the restaurant was open for limited hours or closed on Mondays. It is possible that the restaurant was simply closed for the entire day on Mondays, without any exceptions.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the restaurant must have been open for limited hours or closed on Mondays based solely on the statement \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
