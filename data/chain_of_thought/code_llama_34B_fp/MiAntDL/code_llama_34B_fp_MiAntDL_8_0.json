This is because the statement mentions two possible scenarios: the restaurant being closed on Mondays and the restaurant being open for limited hours. Since the statement does not explicitly state that the restaurant is open for limited hours on Mondays, it suggests that the restaurant might be closed on Mondays.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
