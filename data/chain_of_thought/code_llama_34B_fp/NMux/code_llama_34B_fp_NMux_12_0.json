The statement only indicates that there is no evidence to suggest that the smip was shripped, but it does not rule out the possibility that the smip was shripped.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The smip might not have been shripped\" from \"It's not the case that the smip must have been shripped.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
