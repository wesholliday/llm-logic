This means that the sneg being crampled is a necessary condition for the sneg to sprot the frink.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink. This means that the sneg did not sprot the frink, regardless of whether the sneg was crampled or not.\n\nSince the sneg did not sprot the frink, and the sneg being crampled is a necessary condition for the sneg to sprot the frink, we can conclude that the sneg was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
