This means that the grommet's state (sploffed or not) determines whether or not it plopped the frink.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink. This means that the grommet did not plop the frink, regardless of its state.\n\nSince the grommet did not plop the frink, and the grommet's state determines whether or not it plopped the frink, we can conclude that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
