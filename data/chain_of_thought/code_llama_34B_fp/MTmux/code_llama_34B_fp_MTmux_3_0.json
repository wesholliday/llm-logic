This means that the splat being morphed is a necessary condition for it to quank.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the splat must have quanked. This means that the splat not quanking is a possible outcome, even if it is morphed.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the splat was not morphed, because if it was, it would have quanked, but it didn't.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
