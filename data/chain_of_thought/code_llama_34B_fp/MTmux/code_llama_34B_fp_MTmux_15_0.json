This means that vroombing the dreb is a necessary condition for spening the dreb.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the dreb must have been spened. This means that spening the dreb is not a necessary condition for vroombing the dreb.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that vroombing the dreb is not a sufficient condition for spening the dreb. In other words, just because the dreb was vroombed, it does not mean that the dreb must have been spened.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
