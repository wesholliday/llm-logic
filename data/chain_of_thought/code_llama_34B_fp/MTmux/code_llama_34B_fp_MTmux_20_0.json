This means that bluttering the fleeg is a necessary condition for it to be surned.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned. This means that the fleeg was not surned.\n\nSince bluttering the fleeg is a necessary condition for it to be surned, and the fleeg was not surned, we can conclude that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
