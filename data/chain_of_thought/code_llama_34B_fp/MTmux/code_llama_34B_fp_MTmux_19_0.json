This means that vreebling the smonk is a necessary condition for plagging the smonk.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the smonk must have plagged. This means that plagging the smonk is not a necessary condition for vreebling the smonk.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the smonk was not vreebled, because if it was vreebled, it would have had to plag the smonk, but we know that it didn't plag the smonk.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
