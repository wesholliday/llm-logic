This means that if the zinger was fraggled, it would have been smoogled.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the zinger must have been smoogled. This means that the zinger was not smoogled.\n\nSince the zinger was not smoogled, and the only way for the zinger to be smoogled is if it was fraggled, we can conclude that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
