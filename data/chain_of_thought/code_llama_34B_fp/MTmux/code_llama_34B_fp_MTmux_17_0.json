This means that if the flob was not skizzled, then it did not movate.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the flob must have movated. This means that the flob did not movate, regardless of whether it was skizzled or not.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the flob was not skizzled, because if it was skizzled, it would have movated, but it did not movate.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
