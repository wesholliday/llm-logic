This means that sproinging the wug is a necessary condition for it to be garpled.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the wug must have been garpled. This means that the wug was not garpled.\n\nSince sproinging the wug is a necessary condition for it to be garpled, and the wug was not garpled, we can conclude that the wug was not sproinged.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
