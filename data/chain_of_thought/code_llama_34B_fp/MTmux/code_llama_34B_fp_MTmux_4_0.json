This means that snurgling the fribble is a necessary condition for it to crinkle.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the fribble must have crinked. This means that the fribble did not crinkle.\n\nSince snurgling the fribble is a necessary condition for it to crinkle, and the fribble did not crinkle, we can conclude that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
