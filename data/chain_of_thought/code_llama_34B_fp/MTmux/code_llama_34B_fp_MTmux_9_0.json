If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished.\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the twonk must have been varnished\" implies that the twonk was not varnished, regardless of whether it was plinked or not.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the twonk was not plinked. If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished, but it was not varnished. Therefore, the twonk was not plinked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
