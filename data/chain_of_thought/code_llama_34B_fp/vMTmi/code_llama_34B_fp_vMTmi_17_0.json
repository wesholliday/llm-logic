The second premise states that Kate might not have eaten salad. The conclusion is that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nThe argument is not valid because the second premise does not necessarily contradict the first premise. It is possible that Kate did not eat salad, but it is also possible that she did eat salad. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Ben did not eat pasta based solely on the information provided in the argument.\n\nAnswer: No",
