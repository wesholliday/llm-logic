The second premise states that the truck might not have been metal. However, the conclusion drawn from these premises is that the doll was not plastic.\n\nThe error in this argument is that the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The first premise only states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. It does not state that if the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic. Therefore, the conclusion is not supported by the premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
