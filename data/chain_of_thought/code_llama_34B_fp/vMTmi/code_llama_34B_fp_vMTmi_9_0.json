The second premise states that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. The conclusion is that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nThe argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The first premise only states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. It does not state that if Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Therefore, the conclusion is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: No.",
