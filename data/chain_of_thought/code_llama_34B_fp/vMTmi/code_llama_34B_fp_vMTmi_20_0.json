The second premise states that the banana might not have been yellow. However, the conclusion drawn from these premises is that the apple was not red.\n\nThe error in this argument is that the second premise does not necessarily contradict the first premise. It is possible for the banana to not be yellow, even if the apple is red. Therefore, the conclusion that the apple was not red is not logically supported by the premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
