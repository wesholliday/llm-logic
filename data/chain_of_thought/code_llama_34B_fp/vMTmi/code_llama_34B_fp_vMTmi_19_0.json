The second premise states that Jen might not have watched basketball. However, the conclusion states that Tom did not watch football.\n\nThe argument is logically invalid because the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The first premise only states that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball, but it does not say anything about what happens if Jen did not watch basketball. Therefore, the conclusion that Tom did not watch football is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: No",
