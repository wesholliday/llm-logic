The second premise states that the pants might not have been denim. However, the conclusion drawn from these premises is that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nThe error in this argument is that the second premise does not necessarily contradict the first premise. It is possible that the pants were not denim, but the shirt was still cotton. Therefore, the conclusion that the shirt was not cotton is not logically supported by the premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
