The second premise states that Chris might not have finished the race. The conclusion states that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nThe argument is logically invalid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The first premise only states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race, but it does not state what would happen if Alex did not finish the race. Therefore, the conclusion that Alex did not finish the race is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: No",
