The second premise states that Lucy might not have gone to the zoo. However, the conclusion states that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nThe argument is logically invalid because the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The first premise only states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. It does not state that if Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park. Therefore, the conclusion is not logically supported by the premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
