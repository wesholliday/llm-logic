The second premise states that the muffins might not have been blueberry. The conclusion states that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nThe argument is not valid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The first premise only states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry. It does not state that if the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake could not have been chocolate. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
