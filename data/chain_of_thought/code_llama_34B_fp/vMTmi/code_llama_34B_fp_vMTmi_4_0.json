The second premise states that the robot might not have visited Jupiter. However, the conclusion states that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nThe argument is logically invalid because it uses a false premise. The first premise is based on the assumption that the alien and the robot are related, but there is no evidence to support this assumption. Therefore, the conclusion that the alien did not visit Mars is not supported by the premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
