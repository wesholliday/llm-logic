The second premise states that the wolf might not have been in the den. However, the conclusion drawn from these premises is that the bear was not in the cave, which is not necessarily true.\n\nFor example, it is possible that the bear was in the cave, but the wolf was not in the den. In this case, the first premise would be true, but the conclusion would be false. Therefore, this argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
