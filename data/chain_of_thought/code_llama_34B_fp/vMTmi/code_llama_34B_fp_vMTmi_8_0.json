The first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake. The second premise states that the mummy might not have been awake. However, this does not necessarily mean that the vampire was not awake. It is possible that the vampire was awake, even if the mummy was not. Therefore, the conclusion that the vampire was not awake is not supported by the premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
