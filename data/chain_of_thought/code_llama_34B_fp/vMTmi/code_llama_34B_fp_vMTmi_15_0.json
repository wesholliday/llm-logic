The second premise states that Erin might not have taken a train. The conclusion is that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nThe argument is not valid because the second premise does not necessarily contradict the first premise. It is possible that Erin did not take a train, but Sam still took a plane. Therefore, the conclusion that Sam did not take a plane is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: No",
