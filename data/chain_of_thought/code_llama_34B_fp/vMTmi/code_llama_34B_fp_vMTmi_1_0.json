            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis argument is not logically valid. The first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. The second premise states that Sue might not have been at the wedding. Based on these two premises, we can conclude that Mary might not have been at the wedding. However, this conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThe error in the argument is that the second premise does not contradict the first premise. The second premise simply states that Sue might not have been at the wedding, which does not necessarily mean that Mary was not at the wedding. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that Mary was not at the wedding based on these premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
