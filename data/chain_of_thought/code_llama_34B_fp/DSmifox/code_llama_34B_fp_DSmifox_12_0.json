The second premise, 'Either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped', is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the options must be true. Since the first option, 'the smip must be lupped', is false, the second option, 'it is shripped', must be true. Therefore, we can infer that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
