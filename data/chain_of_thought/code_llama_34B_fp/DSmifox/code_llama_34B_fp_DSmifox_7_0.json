Either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked.\n\nTo infer 'The whiffle is shanked', we need to show that the first statement implies the second statement.\n\nLet's assume the first statement is true, i.e., the whiffle might not be tinked. This means that it is possible that the whiffle is not tinked.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement. If the whiffle is not tinked, then it must be shanked, according to the second statement. Therefore, we can infer that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
