This means that the wug is not necessarily bimmed.\n\nNext, we can see that 'Either the wug must be bimmed or it is flooped' is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the options must be true. In this case, the options are 'the wug must be bimmed' and 'the wug is flooped'.\n\nSince we have already established that the wug is not necessarily bimmed, we can conclude that the only remaining possibility is that the wug is flooped. Therefore, we can infer 'The wug is flooped'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
