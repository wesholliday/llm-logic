The second premise, 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding', means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would have had to be there as well.\n\nSince we know that Sue did not have to be at the wedding, and if Mary was there, Sue would have had to be there too, we can conclude that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
