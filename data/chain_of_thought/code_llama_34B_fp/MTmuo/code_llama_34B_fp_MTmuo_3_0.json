The second premise, 'If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel', means that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel.\n\nIf we assume that the book was written by James, then we can conclude that the book must be a mystery novel, based on the second premise. However, we also know that the book is not necessarily a mystery novel, based on the first premise. Therefore, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, we can infer 'The book was not written by James' from the given premises.",
