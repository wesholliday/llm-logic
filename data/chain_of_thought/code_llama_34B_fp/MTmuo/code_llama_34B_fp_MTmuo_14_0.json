The second premise, 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den', implies that if the bear was in the cave, the wolf must have been in the den.\n\nSince we know that the wolf was not in the den (from the first premise), and the second premise implies that the wolf must have been in the den if the bear was in the cave, we can conclude that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
