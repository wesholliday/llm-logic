The second premise, 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt', implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark would have had to buy the blue shirt.\n\nSince we know that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. If Lisa had bought the red shirt, then Mark would have had to buy the blue shirt, but since Mark did not buy the blue shirt, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
