The second premise, 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo', implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy would have gone to the zoo. However, since Lucy did not go to the zoo (as per the first premise), it means that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'Joe did not go to the park'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
