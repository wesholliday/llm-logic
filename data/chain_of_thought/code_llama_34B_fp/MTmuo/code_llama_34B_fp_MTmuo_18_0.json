            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe can infer 'The doll was not plastic' from the given premises.\n\nThe first premise, 'It's not the case that the truck must have been metal', means that the truck could have been made of any material other than metal. The second premise, 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal', means that if the doll was made of plastic, then the truck must have been made of metal.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible cases:\n\nCase 1: The doll is plastic and the truck is metal. This satisfies both premises.\n\nCase 2: The doll is plastic and the truck is not metal. This satisfies the first premise but not the second.\n\nCase 3: The doll is not plastic and the truck is metal. This satisfies the second premise but not the first.\n\nCase 4: The doll is not plastic and the truck is not metal. This satisfies neither premise.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can see that the only case that satisfies both premises is Case 1, where the doll is plastic and the truck is metal. Therefore, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
