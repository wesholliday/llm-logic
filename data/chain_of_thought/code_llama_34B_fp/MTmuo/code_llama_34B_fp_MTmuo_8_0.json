The second premise, 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake', implies that if the vampire was awake, the mummy must have been awake as well.\n\nSince we know that the mummy was not necessarily awake, and if the vampire was awake, the mummy must have been awake, we can conclude that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
