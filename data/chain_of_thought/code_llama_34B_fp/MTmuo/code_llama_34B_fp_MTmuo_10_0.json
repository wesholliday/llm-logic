The second premise, 'If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside', implies that if the dog was inside, the cat must have been outside.\n\nSince the cat was not necessarily outside, and if the dog was inside, the cat must have been outside, we can conclude that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
