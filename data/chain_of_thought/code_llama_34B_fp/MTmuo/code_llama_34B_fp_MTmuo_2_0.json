The second premise, 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest', implies that if the griffin was in the forest, the unicorn must have been in the forest as well.\n\nSince we know that the unicorn was not necessarily in the forest, and if the griffin was in the forest, the unicorn must have been in the forest, we can conclude that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
