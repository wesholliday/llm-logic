            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe can infer 'The shirt was not cotton' from the given premises.\n\nThe first premise, 'It's not the case that the pants must have been denim', means that the pants were not necessarily denim. The second premise, 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim', implies that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible cases:\n\n1. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim (premise 2).\n2. It's not the case that the pants must have been denim (premise 1).\n\nFrom these two premises, we can conclude that the shirt was not cotton. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim (premise 2). However, it's not the case that the pants must have been denim (premise 1). Therefore, the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
