The second premise, 'If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue', tells us that if the car was red, then the truck would have been blue.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the car was red. If the car was red, then according to the second premise, the truck must have been blue. But we have already established that the truck was not necessarily blue, which contradicts our assumption that the car was red. Therefore, we can conclude that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, we can infer 'The car was not red' from the given premises.",
