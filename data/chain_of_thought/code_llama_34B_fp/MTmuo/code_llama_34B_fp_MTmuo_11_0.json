The second premise, 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry', implies that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would have been blueberry.\n\nSince we know that the muffins were not necessarily blueberry, and if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would have been blueberry, we can conclude that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
