However, it does not necessarily mean that the pen might not be in my bag.\n\nFor example, if I have a pen and I put it in my bag, then I can say \"It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag\" because the pen is not necessarily in my bag. However, if someone asks me if the pen might not be in my bag, I would say no because I know that the pen is in my bag.\n\nAnswer: No.",
