However, this does not necessarily mean that the sunglasses might not be in her bag. It is possible that the sunglasses are in her bag, but there is no logical necessity for them to be there.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The sunglasses might not be in her bag\" from \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
