This does not necessarily mean that Sue might not have chosen pizza, as there could be other possibilities.\n\nFor example, Sue might have chosen pasta instead of pizza. In this case, we cannot infer that Sue might not have chosen pizza.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Sue might not have chosen pizza from the statement \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
