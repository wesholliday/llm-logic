This does not necessarily mean that he might not have played basketball, as there could be other factors at play. For example, Jeff might have been injured and unable to play basketball, or he might have chosen not to play basketball that day.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Jeff might not have played basketball based solely on the statement \"It's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
