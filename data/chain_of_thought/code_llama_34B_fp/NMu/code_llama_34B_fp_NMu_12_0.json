However, it does not necessarily mean that the jacket might not be draped over the chair.\n\nFor example, if we know that the jacket is not draped over the chair because it is hanging in the closet, then we can infer that the jacket is not draped over the chair. However, if we only know that the jacket is not necessarily draped over the chair, then we cannot infer that the jacket might not be draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: No.",
