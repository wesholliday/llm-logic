However, it does not necessarily mean that the book might not have been written by James.\n\nFor example, if we know that the book was written by either James or John, and we know that it was not written by James, then we can infer that it must have been written by John. In this case, we can say that the book might not have been written by James, but we cannot infer that it might not have been written by James based solely on the statement \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
