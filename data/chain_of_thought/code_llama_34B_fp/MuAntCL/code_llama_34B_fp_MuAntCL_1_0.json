The fact that the envelope was \"upstairs\" implies that it was not in the same room as the person who was looking for it. Additionally, the fact that the envelope was \"under a bed\" provides further evidence that it was not in a location that was easily accessible to the person who was looking for it.\n\nAnswer: No.",
