            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement. It expresses a cause-and-effect relationship between the color of the car and the color of the truck. The statement \"The truck was blue\" is a factual statement that simply states the color of the truck.\n\nTo determine whether we can logically infer \"The car was red\" from these two statements, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements. In particular, we need to consider whether the first statement provides any information about the color of the car.\n\nThe first statement does provide some information about the color of the car. Specifically, it implies that if the car was red, then the truck would be blue. However, it does not provide any information about the color of the car if the truck is not blue. Therefore, we cannot logically infer \"The car was red\" from these two statements.\n\nAnswer: No.",
