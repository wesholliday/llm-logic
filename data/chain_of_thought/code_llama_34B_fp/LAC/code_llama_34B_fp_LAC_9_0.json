            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement. It expresses a cause-and-effect relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. The statement \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a fact that is independent of the conditional statement.\n\nTo determine whether we can logically infer \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" from the given information, we need to consider the possibility that the conditional statement may not be true. If the conditional statement is false, then the inference \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" would be invalid.\n\nHowever, since we are also given the fact \"Mark bought the blue shirt\", we can infer that the conditional statement is true. Therefore, we can logically infer \"Lisa bought the red shirt\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
