This premise states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob would have chosen pasta. However, it does not state that if Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise: 'Bob chose pasta'. This premise simply states that Bob chose pasta.\n\nUsing these two premises, we can conclude that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob would have chosen pasta. However, we cannot logically infer that Sue chose pizza based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
