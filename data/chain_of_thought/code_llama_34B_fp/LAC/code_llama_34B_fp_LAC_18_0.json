In this case, the premises are \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" and \"The truck was metal.\" The conclusion is \"The doll was plastic.\"\n\nTo determine whether the argument is valid, we need to check whether the premises logically entail the conclusion. In this case, the premises do not logically entail the conclusion, so the argument is not valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
