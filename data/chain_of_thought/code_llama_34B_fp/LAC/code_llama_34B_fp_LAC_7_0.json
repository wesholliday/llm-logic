This means that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris may or may not have finished the race.\n\nThe second premise, 'Chris finished the race', states that Chris did finish the race.\n\nFrom these two premises, we can conclude that Alex finished the race. If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris may not have finished the race, which contradicts the second premise. Therefore, we can logically infer that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
