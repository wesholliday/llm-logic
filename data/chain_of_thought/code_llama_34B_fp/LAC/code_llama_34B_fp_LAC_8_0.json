This means that if the vampire was awake, the mummy would also be awake.\n\nThe second premise states that 'The mummy was awake'.\n\nFrom these two premises, we can conclude that if the vampire was awake, the mummy would also be awake. Since the mummy is awake, we can infer that the vampire must also be awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
