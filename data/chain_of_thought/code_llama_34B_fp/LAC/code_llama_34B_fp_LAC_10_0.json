This means that the dog being inside is a sufficient condition for the cat being outside.\n\nThe second premise states that the cat was outside.\n\nSince the cat was outside, we can conclude that the dog being inside is a necessary condition for the cat being outside. Therefore, we can infer that the dog was inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
