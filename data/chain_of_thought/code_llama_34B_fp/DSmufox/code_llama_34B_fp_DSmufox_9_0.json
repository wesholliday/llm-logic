The second premise, 'Either the twonk must be plinked or it is varnished', means that the twonk is either plinked or varnished.\n\nSince the twonk is not plinked (according to the first premise), it must be varnished (according to the second premise). Therefore, we can infer 'The twonk is varnished'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
