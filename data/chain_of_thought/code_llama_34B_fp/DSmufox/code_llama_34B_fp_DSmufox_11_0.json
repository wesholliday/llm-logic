The second premise, 'Either the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed', means that the flug is either zimmed or blummed, but we don't know which one it is.\n\nSince we know that the flug is not zimmed (from the first premise), and we also know that it is either zimmed or blummed (from the second premise), we can conclude that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
