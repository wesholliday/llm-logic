This means that the splat is not quanked.\n\nSecond, we can assume that the statement \"Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed\" is true. This means that either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed.\n\nNow, since we have already established that the splat is not quanked, we can conclude that it must be morphed. Therefore, we can infer 'The splat is morphed'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
