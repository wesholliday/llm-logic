This means that the glip is not necessarily tragged.\n\nSecond, we can see that 'Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged' is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the options must be true. Since we have already established that the glip is not necessarily tragged, we can focus on the second option, which is 'it is slogged'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The glip is slogged' from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
