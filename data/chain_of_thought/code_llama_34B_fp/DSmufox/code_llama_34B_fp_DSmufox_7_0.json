The second premise, 'Either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked', means that if the whiffle is not tinked, then it must be shanked.\n\nSince we have established that the whiffle is not tinked, and we know that if it is not tinked, then it must be shanked, we can conclude that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
