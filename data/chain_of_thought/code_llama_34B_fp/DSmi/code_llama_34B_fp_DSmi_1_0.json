The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" means that Fido is either inside or in the garden, but we don't know which one it is. However, the statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" implies that Fido is not in the garden, which means that it must be inside. Therefore, we can conclude that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
