In other words, the statement is inclusive of both possibilities, but it does not imply that both possibilities are true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The blurble might be a crunk and it might be a flibbit\" because this statement implies that the blurble is both a crunk and a flibbit, which is not necessarily true based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
