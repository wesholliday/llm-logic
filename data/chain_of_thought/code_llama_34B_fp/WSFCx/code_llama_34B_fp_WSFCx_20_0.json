However, it does not explicitly state that the grooble can do both actions simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the grooble might flonk grooble and it might fribble froodle frozz. The correct inference is that the grooble might flonk grooble or it might fribble froodle frozz.\n\nAnswer: No.",
