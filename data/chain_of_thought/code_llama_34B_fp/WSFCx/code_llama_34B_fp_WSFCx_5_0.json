The sentence is structured as follows: \"If the quazzle fizzles frozz, then it might flonk glorp.\" This means that if the quazzle fizzles frozz, it is possible that it will flonk glorp.\n\nHowever, the statement does not explicitly state that the quazzle will definitely fizzle frozz. It only states that if it does, then it might flonk glorp. Therefore, we cannot infer that the quazzle will definitely fizzle frozz and flonk glorp.\n\nAnswer: No.",
