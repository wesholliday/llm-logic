However, it does not explicitly state that the wump can do both actions at the same time.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The wump might blurble grazzle and it might flibbit snork.\" This inference would require additional information or context to support the idea that the wump can perform both actions simultaneously.\n\nAnswer: No.",
