However, it does not explicitly state that the glorp can do both actions at the same time.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the glorp might zibble quimble and it might flonk zizz blimp. The correct inference is that the glorp might zibble quimble or it might flonk zizz blimp, but we cannot infer that it can do both at the same time.\n\nAnswer: No.",
