However, it does not explicitly state that both options are possible.\n\nTo infer that the zizz might blimple and it might grooble the snizzle, we would need additional information or context that suggests that both options are indeed possible. Without this additional information, we cannot infer that both options are possible, and therefore the answer is no.\n\nAnswer: No.",
