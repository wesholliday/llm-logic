This means that if the dreb is not vroombed, it must be spened.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the dreb must be spened. This means that the dreb is not spened.\n\nSince the dreb is not spened and it's not the case that the dreb must be spened, we can conclude that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
