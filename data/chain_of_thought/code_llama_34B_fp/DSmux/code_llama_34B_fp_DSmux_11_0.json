This means that the flug is either blummed or zimmed, but we don't know which one it is.\n\nThe second premise states that 'It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed'. This means that the flug is not zimmed.\n\nSince the flug is not zimmed and the first premise states that the flug is either blummed or zimmed, we can conclude that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
