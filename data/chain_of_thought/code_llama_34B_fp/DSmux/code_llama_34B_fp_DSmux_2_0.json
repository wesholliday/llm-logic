This premise states that the wug is either flooped or bimmed, but it doesn't specify which one it is.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise: 'It's not the case that the wug must be bimmed'. This premise rules out the possibility that the wug is bimmed.\n\nSince the wug is not bimmed, and the only other option is that it is flooped, we can conclude that the wug is flooped.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
