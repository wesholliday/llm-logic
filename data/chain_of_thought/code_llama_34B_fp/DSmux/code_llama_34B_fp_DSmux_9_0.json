This means that the twonk is either varnished or it must be plinked, but we don't know which one it is.\n\nThe second premise states that 'It's not the case that the twonk must be plinked'. This means that the twonk is not plinked, but we don't know whether it is varnished or not.\n\nFrom these two premises, we can conclude that the twonk is varnished. If the twonk was not varnished, then it would have to be plinked, which is not the case. Therefore, the only possible conclusion is that the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
