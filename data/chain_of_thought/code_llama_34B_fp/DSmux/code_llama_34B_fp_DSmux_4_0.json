This means that the fribble is either snurgled or crinked, but we don't know which one it is.\n\nThe second premise states that 'It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked'. This means that the fribble is not crinked, but we don't know whether it is snurgled or not.\n\nFrom these two premises, we can conclude that the fribble is snurgled. This is because the first premise states that the fribble is either snurgled or crinked, and the second premise rules out the possibility that the fribble is crinked. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
