This means that the smonk is either vreebled or plagged, but we don't know which one it is.\n\nThe second premise states that 'It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged'. This means that the smonk is not plagged, and since we know that it is either vreebled or plagged, it must be vreebled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The smonk is vreebled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
