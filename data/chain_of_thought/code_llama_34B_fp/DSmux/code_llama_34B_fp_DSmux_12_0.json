This means that if the smip is not shripped, then it must be lupped.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the smip must be lupped. This means that the smip is not lupped.\n\nSince the smip is not lupped and the first premise states that either the smip is shripped or it must be lupped, we can conclude that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
