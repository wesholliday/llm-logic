This means that the sneg is either crampled or sproted, but we don't know which one it is.\n\nThe second premise states that 'It's not the case that the sneg must be sproted'. This means that the sneg is not sproted, but we don't know whether it is crampled or not.\n\nFrom these two premises, we can conclude that the sneg is crampled. If the sneg were sproted, then the first premise would be true, and the second premise would be false. Since the second premise is true, we can infer that the sneg is crampled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
