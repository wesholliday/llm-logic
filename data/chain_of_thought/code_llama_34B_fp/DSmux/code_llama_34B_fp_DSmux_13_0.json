This means that the glip is either slogged or tragged, but we don't know which one it is.\n\nThe second premise states that 'It's not the case that the glip must be tragged'. This means that the glip is not tragged.\n\nSince the glip is not tragged, and the only other option is that it is slogged, we can infer that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
