Either the whiffle is shanked or it must be tinked.\n2. It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that the whiffle is either shanked or tinked. From premise 2, we know that the whiffle is not tinked. Therefore, we can conclude that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
