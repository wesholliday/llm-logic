This means that the flugel is either blimmed or zargled, but we don't know which one it is.\n\nThe second premise states that 'It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled'. This means that the flugel is not zargled.\n\nSince the flugel is not zargled, and the only other option is that it is blimmed, we can conclude that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
