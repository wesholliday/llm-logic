This means that the fleeg is either bluttered or surned, but we don't know which one it is.\n\nThe second premise states that 'It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned'. This means that the fleeg is not surned.\n\nSince the fleeg is not surned, and the only other option is that it is bluttered, we can conclude that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
