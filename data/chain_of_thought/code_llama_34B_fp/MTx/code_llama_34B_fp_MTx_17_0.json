This means that if the antecedent (the first part of the statement) is true, then the consequent (the second part of the statement) must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the antecedent is \"the flob was skizzled,\" and the consequent is \"the flob movated.\" If the flob was skizzled, then it would have movated. However, since we know that the flob did not movate, we can conclude that the antecedent (the flob was skizzled) must be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flob was not skizzled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
