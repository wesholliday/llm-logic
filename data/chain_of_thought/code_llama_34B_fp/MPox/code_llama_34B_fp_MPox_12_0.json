The first premise, 'The smip was shripped', implies that the smip was in a state of being shripped. The second premise, 'If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint', is a conditional statement that implies that if the smip was in a state of being shripped, then it must have lupped the zoint. Since we have established that the smip was in a state of being shripped, we can conclude that the smip lupped the zoint.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
