The second premise, 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled', is a conditional statement that implies that if the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n\nSince the first premise is true, and the second premise is a logical consequence of the first premise, we can infer that the sprocket was daggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
