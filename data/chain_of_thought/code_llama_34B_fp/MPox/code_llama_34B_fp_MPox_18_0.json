If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\n\nTo infer \"The shank was nugged,\" we need to determine if the second statement implies the first statement.\n\nWe can analyze the second statement as follows:\n\n* If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\n* This statement is in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n* To determine if the second statement implies the first statement, we need to check if the first statement (A) is true, and if the second statement (B) is true.\n* If A is true (the shank was plooked), and B is true (the shank was nugged), then the second statement implies the first statement.\n\nNow, let's check if the first statement is true:\n\n* The shank was plooked.\n* This statement is in the form \"A was B,\" where A is \"the shank\" and B is \"plooked.\"\n* To determine if this statement is true, we need to know what \"plooked\" means.\n* If \"plooked\" means \"to look at something in a particular way,\" then the statement is true.\n\nNow, let's check if the second statement is true:\n\n* If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\n* This statement is in the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the shank was plooked\" and B is \"the shank was nugged.\"\n* To determine if this statement is true, we need to know what \"nugged\" means.\n* If \"nugged\" means \"to look at something in a particular way,\" then the statement is true.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that the second statement implies the first statement, and therefore, we can infer \"The shank was nugged.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
