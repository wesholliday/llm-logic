To determine whether we can infer \"The flugel was zargled\" from these statements, we need to evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\nThe argument is valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion \"The flugel was zargled\" does logically follow from the premises \"The flugel was blimmed\" and \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\" Therefore, we can infer \"The flugel was zargled\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
