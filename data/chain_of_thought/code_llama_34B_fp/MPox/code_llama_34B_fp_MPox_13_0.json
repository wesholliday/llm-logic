If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\n\nTo infer \"The glip was tragged,\" we need to determine if the second premise implies the conclusion.\n\nThe second premise is a conditional statement, \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\" This means that if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true, then the consequent (the part after the \"then\") must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the antecedent is \"the glip was slogged,\" which is true based on the first premise. Therefore, we can conclude that the consequent, \"the glip was tragged,\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
