If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\n\nTo infer \"It was varnished,\" we need to determine if the second premise implies the conclusion.\n\nThe second premise is a conditional statement, \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\" This means that if the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished, but we don't know whether the twonk was plinked or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"It was varnished\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
