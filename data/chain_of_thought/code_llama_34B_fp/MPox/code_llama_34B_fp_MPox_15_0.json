If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that the dreb was spened. This is because the second statement is a logical consequence of the first statement. In other words, if the dreb was vroombed, then it must have been spened, according to the second statement. Therefore, we can conclude that the dreb was spened.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
