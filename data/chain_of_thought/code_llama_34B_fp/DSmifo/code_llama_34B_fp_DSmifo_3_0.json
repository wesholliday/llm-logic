In this case, the alternatives are \"the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" and \"the keys are in the drawer.\"\n\nSince we know that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, we can infer that the only remaining alternative is that the keys are in the drawer. Therefore, we can conclude that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
