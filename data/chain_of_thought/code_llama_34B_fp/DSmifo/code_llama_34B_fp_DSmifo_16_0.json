The first statement, \"The pen might not be on my desk,\" implies that the pen is not necessarily on the desk. The second statement, \"Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag,\" provides two possible locations for the pen: on the desk or in the bag. Since the pen is not on the desk, it must be in the bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
