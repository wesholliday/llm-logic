If the newspaper were on the porch, then the first premise would be true, and the second premise would be false. Since the second premise is true, we can conclude that the first premise must be false, which means the newspaper is not on the porch. Therefore, the only possible location for the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
