The project might be completed by Friday, or it might be extended.\n2. The project might be completed by Friday, or it might not be extended.\n\nBased on the context, it is more likely that the statement is referring to the first interpretation, where the project might be completed by Friday or it might be extended. This is because the word \"or\" is used in the statement, which suggests a choice between two options.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
