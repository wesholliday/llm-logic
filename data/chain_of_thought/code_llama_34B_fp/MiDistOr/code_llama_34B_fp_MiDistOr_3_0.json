This statement does not explicitly state that the keys might be in both locations, but it does suggest that they could be in either location.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The keys might be in the drawer or they might be on the table\" is a possible interpretation of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
