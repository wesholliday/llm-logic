The word \"or\" suggests a mutually exclusive option, meaning that the movie is either in English or subtitled, but not both.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the movie might be in English or it might be subtitled. The correct inference is that the movie might be in English or it might be subtitled, but not both.\n\nAnswer: No.",
