            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" can be represented as a conditional statement:\n\nIf A, then B\n\nWhere A is \"The shirt was cotton\" and B is \"The pants were denim\".\n\nThe statement \"The pants were denim\" is a premise, and it is not a conditional statement.\n\nTo deduce \"The shirt was cotton\" from the given statements, we need to use the principle of modus ponens, which states that if a conditional statement is true and one of its premises is true, then the other premise must also be true.\n\nIn this case, we have two premises: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" and \"The pants were denim\". We can deduce \"The shirt was cotton\" if we assume that the first premise is true and the second premise is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
