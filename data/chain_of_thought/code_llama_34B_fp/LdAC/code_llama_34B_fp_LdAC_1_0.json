            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement. It expresses a cause-and-effect relationship between Mary's attendance at the wedding and Sue's attendance at the wedding. The statement \"Sue was at the wedding\" is a statement of fact, indicating that Sue did attend the wedding.\n\nTo determine whether we can logically deduce \"Mary was at the wedding\" from these two statements, we need to consider the logical relationship between them. The first statement expresses a conditional relationship between Mary's attendance and Sue's attendance, while the second statement simply states that Sue did attend the wedding.\n\nIn order to deduce \"Mary was at the wedding\" from these two statements, we would need to know that the conditional relationship expressed in the first statement is true. If the conditional relationship is false, then we cannot deduce \"Mary was at the wedding\" from the two statements.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot logically deduce \"Mary was at the wedding\" from the two statements \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and \"Sue was at the wedding\".",
