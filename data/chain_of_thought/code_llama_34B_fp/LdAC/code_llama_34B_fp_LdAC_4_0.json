The rule of modus ponens states that if we know that \"If A then B\" and \"B\" are both true, then we can logically deduce \"A\".\n\nTherefore, if we can deduce \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" and \"The robot visited Jupiter\" from the given statements, we can use modus ponens to deduce \"The alien visited Mars\".\n\nHowever, we cannot deduce \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" from the given statements. Therefore, we cannot use modus ponens to deduce \"The alien visited Mars\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
