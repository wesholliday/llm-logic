            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement. It expresses a relationship between two statements, where the truth of the second statement (the banana being yellow) depends on the truth of the first statement (the apple being red).\n\nThe statement \"The banana was yellow\" is a factual statement that is independent of the first statement. It simply states that the banana was yellow, without any conditions or implications.\n\nTo deduce \"The apple was red\" from the given statements, we need to use the principle of modus ponens. This principle states that if a conditional statement (if-then statement) and the antecedent (the first part of the if-then statement) are true, then the consequent (the second part of the if-then statement) must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\", and the antecedent is \"The apple was red\". The consequent is \"The banana was yellow\". Since we have established that the antecedent is true (the apple was red), and we have also established that the consequent is true (the banana was yellow), we can logically deduce that the conditional statement is true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
