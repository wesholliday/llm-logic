            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" can be represented as a conditional statement, where the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) implies the consequent (Amy played tennis).\n\nThe statement \"Amy played tennis\" is a separate statement that is not connected to the conditional statement.\n\nTo deduce \"Jeff played basketball\" from the given statements, we need to use the principle of modus ponens, which states that if a conditional statement is true and the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n\nIn this case, we have the conditional statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" and the statement \"Amy played tennis\". If we assume that the conditional statement is true, then we can deduce that \"Jeff played basketball\" must also be true, since the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) implies the consequent (Amy played tennis), and we have already established that the consequent (Amy played tennis) is true.\n\nTherefore, we can logically deduce \"Jeff played basketball\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
