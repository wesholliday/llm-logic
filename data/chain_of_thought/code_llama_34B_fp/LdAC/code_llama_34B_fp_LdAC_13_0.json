            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement. It expresses a cause-and-effect relationship between the color of the car and the color of the truck. The statement \"The truck was blue\" is a factual statement that simply states the color of the truck.\n\nTo deduce \"The car was red\" from these two statements, we need to use the principle of modus ponens. This principle states that if a conditional statement is true and the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is true, then the consequent (the \"then\" part) must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is true, and the factual statement \"The truck was blue\" is also true. Therefore, we can conclude that the antecedent \"The car was red\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
