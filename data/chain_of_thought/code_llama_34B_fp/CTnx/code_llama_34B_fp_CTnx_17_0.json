It suggests that if the flob was in a state of skizzle, then it did not move.\n\nTo infer \"If the flob movated, then the flob was not skizzled,\" we need to reverse the conditional. We can do this by reversing the order of the statements and changing the wording slightly.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the flob movated, then the flob was not skizzled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
