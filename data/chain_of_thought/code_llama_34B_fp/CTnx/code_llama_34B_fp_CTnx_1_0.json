It implies that if the flugel was blimmed, then it could not have been zargled.\n\nTo infer \"If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed,\" we need to reverse the conditional. This can be done by switching the order of the clauses and changing the word order in the second clause.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
