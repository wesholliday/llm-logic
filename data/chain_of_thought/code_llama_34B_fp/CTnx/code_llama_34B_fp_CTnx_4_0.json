It suggests that if the fribble was snurgled, then it did not crink.\n\nTo infer \"If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled,\" we need to use the principle of contraposition. The principle of contraposition states that if a conditional statement is true, then the contrapositive of the statement is also true. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nTherefore, if we can infer \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble did not crink,\" then we can also infer \"If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
