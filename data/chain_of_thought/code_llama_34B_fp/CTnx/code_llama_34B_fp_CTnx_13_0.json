Specifically, it suggests that if the glip was slogged, then it could not have been tragged.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer \"If the glip was tragged, then the glip was not slogged\" from this statement. This is because the first statement only implies a negative correlation between the two events, and does not rule out the possibility that the glip could have been both slogged and tragged.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no, we cannot infer \"If the glip was tragged, then the glip was not slogged\" from \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was not tragged\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
