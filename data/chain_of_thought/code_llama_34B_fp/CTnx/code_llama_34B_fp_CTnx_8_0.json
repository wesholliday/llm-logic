The material conditional is a logical connection between two statements, where the truth of the second statement is contingent on the truth of the first statement.\n\nIn this case, the first statement is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and the second statement is \"the sprocket was not daggled.\" The material conditional states that if the first statement is true, then the second statement must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\" from the given statement, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nAnswer: No.\n\nThe given statement only provides information about the relationship between \"the sprocket was cranked\" and \"the sprocket was not daggled.\" It does not provide any information about the relationship between \"the sprocket was daggled\" and \"the sprocket was not cranked.\" Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the given information.",
