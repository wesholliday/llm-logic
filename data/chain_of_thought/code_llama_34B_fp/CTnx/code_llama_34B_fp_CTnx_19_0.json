It states that if the smonk was vreebled, then it did not plagged.\n\nTo infer \"If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled,\" we need to use the contrapositive of the given statement. The contrapositive of a necessary condition is a sufficient condition. In other words, if the contrapositive of the given statement is true, then the original statement must also be true.\n\nThe contrapositive of \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk did not plagged\" is \"If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled.\" Therefore, if we can infer \"If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled,\" then we can also infer \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk did not plagged.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
