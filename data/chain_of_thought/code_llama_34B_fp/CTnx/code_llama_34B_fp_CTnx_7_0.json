It states that if the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle did not tink. This means that if the whiffle was shanked, it is not possible for the whiffle to tink.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'If the whiffle tink, then the whiffle was not shanked', we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. In this case, the two statements are negatively related, meaning that if one statement is true, the other statement is false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the whiffle tink, then the whiffle was not shanked' because if the whiffle tink, it is not possible for the whiffle to have been shanked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
