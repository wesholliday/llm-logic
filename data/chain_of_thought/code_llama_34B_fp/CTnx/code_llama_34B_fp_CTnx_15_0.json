            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was not spened.\" This statement is in the form of a conditional, specifically a negative conditional. It can be read as \"If the dreb was vroombed, then it was not the case that the dreb was spened.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\" from this statement, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement is a negative conditional, which means that it is not necessarily true that the dreb was not spened if it was vroombed. However, if the dreb was spened, then it is true that the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
