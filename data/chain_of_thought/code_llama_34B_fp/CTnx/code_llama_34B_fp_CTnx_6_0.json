It can be read as \"If the grommet was sploffed, then it did not plop the frink.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"If the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed,\" we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement implies that if the grommet was sploffed, it did not plop the frink. This means that if the grommet plopped the frink, it must not have been sploffed. Therefore, we can infer \"If the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
