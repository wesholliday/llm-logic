It can be read as \"If the sneg was crampled, then it did not sprot the frink.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled\" from this statement, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement implies that if the sneg was crampled, it did not sprot the frink. This means that if the sneg did sprot the frink, it was not crampled. Therefore, we can infer \"If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
