            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat did not quank.\" This statement is in the form of a conditional, specifically a material conditional. The material conditional states that if a certain condition is met, then a certain outcome will occur. In this case, the condition is \"the splat was morphed,\" and the outcome is \"the splat did not quank.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed\" from the given statement, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. The first statement is a conditional, and the second statement is also a conditional. However, the second statement is a different conditional, specifically a counterfactual conditional. The counterfactual conditional states that if a certain condition is not met, then a certain outcome will not occur.\n\nIn this case, we can infer \"If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed\" from the given statement because the two conditionals are logically equivalent. If the splat was morphed, then it did not quank, and if the splat quank, then it was not morphed. Therefore, we can conclude that the two conditionals are logically equivalent, and we can infer one from the other.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
