This rule states that if we know that S \u2192 \u00acG, and we know that G is true, then we can infer that S is false.\n\nApplying this rule to our situation, we can see that if the wug was garpled (G is true), then we can infer that the wug was not sproinged (S is false). Therefore, we can infer \"If the wug was garpled, then the wug was not sproinged\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
