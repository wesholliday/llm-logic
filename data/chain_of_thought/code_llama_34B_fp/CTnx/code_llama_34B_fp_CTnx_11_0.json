This law states that a statement cannot both be true and false at the same time.\n\nIn this case, the statement \"the flug was blummed\" is true, and the statement \"the flug was not zimmed\" is also true. Therefore, we can infer that \"If the flug was zimmed, then the flug was not blummed\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
