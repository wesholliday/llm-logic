It states that if the shank was plooked, then it could not have been nugged.\n\nTo infer \"If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked,\" we need to reverse the conditional. This can be done by switching the order of the clauses and changing the word \"if\" to \"then.\" The resulting statement is \"If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
