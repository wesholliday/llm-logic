The material implication can be represented as a logical equivalence, where the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is logically equivalent to the consequent (the \"then\" part).\n\nIn this case, the antecedent is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and the consequent is \"the dreb was spened.\" Therefore, we can logically deduce that \"if the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
