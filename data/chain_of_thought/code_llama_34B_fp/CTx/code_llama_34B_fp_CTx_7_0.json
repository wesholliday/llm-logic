            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\" This statement is in the form of a conditional, specifically a material conditional. The material conditional states that if a certain condition is met, then a certain outcome will occur. In this case, the condition is \"the whiffle was shanked,\" and the outcome is \"the whiffle tinked.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked,\" we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. The first statement is a material conditional, and the second statement is a negation of the first statement.\n\nIn general, the negation of a material conditional is not equivalent to a material conditional. For example, \"If it rains, then the streets will be wet\" is a material conditional, but the negation \"If the streets are not wet, then it did not rain\" is not equivalent.\n\nHowever, in this specific case, we can infer \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked\" because the two statements are logically related. If the whiffle did not tink, then it was not shanked, because the shanking of the whiffle is the only possible cause of the tink.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
