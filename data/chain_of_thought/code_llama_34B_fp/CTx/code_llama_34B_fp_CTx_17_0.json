However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the flob does not movate.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the flob did not movate, then the flob was not skizzled\" from the given statement. The lack of information about what happens if the flob does not movate means that we cannot make any conclusions about the relationship between the flob being skizzled and the flob movating.\n\nAnswer: No.",
