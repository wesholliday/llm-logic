However, it does not provide any information about the relationship between the sprocket being daggled and the sprocket being cranked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\" from the given statement. The absence of information about the relationship between the sprocket being daggled and the sprocket being cranked means that we cannot draw any conclusions about the relationship between the two.\n\nAnswer: No.",
