However, it does not necessarily mean that it's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball.\n\nFor example, if Jeff is a professional basketball player, it's possible that he might not have played basketball on a particular day due to injury or other reasons. However, it's still possible that he played basketball on that day.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball\" from \"Jeff might not have played basketball\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
