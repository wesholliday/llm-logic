However, it does not necessarily mean that it's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet.\n\nFor example, if a person has two pairs of shoes, one pair might be in the closet and the other pair might be in the living room. In this case, it's possible that the shoes might not be in the closet, but it's still the case that the shoes must be in one of the two rooms.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet\" from \"The shoes might not be in the closet\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
