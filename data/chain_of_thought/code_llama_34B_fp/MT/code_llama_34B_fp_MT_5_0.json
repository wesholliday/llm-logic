The statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is a conditional statement, which means that it is possible for Jeff to play basketball without Amy playing tennis. However, the statement \"Amy did not play tennis\" contradicts the conditional statement, as it implies that Amy did not play tennis regardless of whether Jeff played basketball. Therefore, we can conclude that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
