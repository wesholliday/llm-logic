This means that the dog being inside is a sufficient condition for the cat being outside.\n\nThe second premise states that the cat was not outside. This means that the cat was not in the outside location.\n\nSince the cat was not outside, and the first premise states that if the dog was inside, then the cat would be outside, we can conclude that the dog must have been inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
