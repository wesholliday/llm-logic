The second premise, 'Sue was not at the wedding', contradicts the first premise. If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary must not have been at the wedding either, since the first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would also be at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'Mary was not at the wedding'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
