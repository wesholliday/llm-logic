The statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" implies that the griffin and the unicorn are both in the forest. However, the statement \"The unicorn was not in the forest\" contradicts this assumption. Therefore, we can conclude that the griffin was not in the forest either.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
