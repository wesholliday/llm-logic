            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe can infer that the shirt was not cotton because the statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is a conditional statement. This means that the truth of the conclusion (the pants were denim) depends on the truth of the antecedent (the shirt was cotton). If the antecedent is false (the shirt was not cotton), then the conclusion is necessarily false (the pants were not denim). Therefore, if we know that the pants were not denim, we can conclude that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
