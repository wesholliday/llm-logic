Therefore, if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then the implication is true, and we cannot infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nHowever, if Lisa did buy the red shirt, then the implication is only true if Mark also bought the blue shirt. If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then the implication is false, and we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: No.",
