            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement. It expresses a cause-and-effect relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. The statement \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is a premise that provides evidence for the conditional statement.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" from the given information, we need to consider the logical form of the conditional statement. The logical form of a conditional statement is \"If A, then B\" is logically equivalent to \"Not A, or B.\"\n\nTherefore, the logical form of the given conditional statement is \"Not Lisa bought the red shirt, or Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nNow, we have the premise \"Lisa bought the red shirt.\" This premise contradicts the negation of the antecedent of the conditional statement, which is \"Not Lisa bought the red shirt.\" Therefore, we cannot infer \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
