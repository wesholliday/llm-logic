It expresses a cause-and-effect relationship between the cake being chocolate and the muffins being blueberry.\n\nThe statement \"The cake was chocolate\" is a factual statement that simply states that the cake was chocolate.\n\nTo infer \"The muffins were blueberry\" from these two statements, we need to use the principle of modus ponens. This principle states that if a conditional statement is true and the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is true, then the consequent (the \"then\" part) must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is true, and the antecedent \"The cake was chocolate\" is also true. Therefore, we can infer that the consequent \"The muffins were blueberry\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
