The statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Sam took a plane) is true, then the consequent (Erin took a train) must also be true. Since we know that Sam took a plane (based on the second statement), we can conclude that Erin took a train.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
