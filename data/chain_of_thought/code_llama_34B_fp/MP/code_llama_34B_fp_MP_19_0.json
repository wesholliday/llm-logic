It expresses a cause-and-effect relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball. The statement \"Tom watched football\" is a premise that provides evidence for the conditional statement.\n\nTo infer \"Jen watched basketball\" from the given information, we need to determine whether the premise \"Tom watched football\" is sufficient to support the conclusion \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nIn this case, the premise \"Tom watched football\" does not provide sufficient evidence to support the conclusion \"Jen watched basketball.\" The conditional statement only implies that if Tom watched football, then Jen might have watched basketball, but it does not guarantee that she did. Therefore, we cannot infer \"Jen watched basketball\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
