It expresses a cause-and-effect relationship between the color of the car and the color of the truck. The statement \"The car was red\" is a factual statement that simply states the color of the car.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"The truck was blue\" from the given information, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. In this case, the first statement is a conditional statement, and the second statement is a factual statement.\n\nIf the car was red, then the truck was blue.\nThe car was red.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the truck was blue.
