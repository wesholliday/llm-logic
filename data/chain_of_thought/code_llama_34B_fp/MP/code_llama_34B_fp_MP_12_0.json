It expresses a cause-and-effect relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo. The statement \"Joe went to the park\" is a premise that provides evidence for the conditional statement.\n\nTo infer \"Lucy went to the zoo\" from the given information, we need to determine whether the premise \"Joe went to the park\" is sufficient to support the conclusion \"Lucy went to the zoo\".\n\nIn this case, the premise \"Joe went to the park\" does not provide sufficient evidence to support the conclusion \"Lucy went to the zoo\". The conditional statement only expresses a possibility, not a certainty. Therefore, we cannot infer \"Lucy went to the zoo\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
