The second premise, \"Alex finished the race,\" states that Alex finished the race.\n\nFrom these two premises, we can conclude that Chris finished the race. This is because the first premise states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race, and the second premise states that Alex finished the race. Therefore, we can infer that Chris finished the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
