It expresses a cause-and-effect relationship between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis. The statement \"Jeff played basketball\" is a premise that provides evidence for the conditional statement.\n\nTo infer \"Amy played tennis\" from the given information, we need to determine whether the premise \"Jeff played basketball\" is sufficient to support the conclusion \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nIn this case, the premise \"Jeff played basketball\" does not provide sufficient evidence to support the conclusion \"Amy played tennis.\" The conditional statement only implies that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy might have played tennis, but it does not guarantee that Amy actually played tennis. Therefore, we cannot infer \"Amy played tennis\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
