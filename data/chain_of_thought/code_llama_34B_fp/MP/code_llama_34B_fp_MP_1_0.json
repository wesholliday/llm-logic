            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe can infer 'Sue was at the wedding' from the given information. The first premise, 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. The second premise, 'Mary was at the wedding', states that Mary was indeed at the wedding.\n\nFrom these two premises, we can conclude that Sue was at the wedding. This is because the first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding, and the second premise states that Mary was at the wedding. Therefore, we can infer that Sue was also at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
