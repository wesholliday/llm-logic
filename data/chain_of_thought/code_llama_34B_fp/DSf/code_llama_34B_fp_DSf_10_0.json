The missing sock isn't under the bed.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nTo do this, we need to consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. The missing sock is under the bed.\n2. The missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n3. The missing sock is not under the bed and not in the laundry basket.\n\nIf the missing sock is under the bed, then it's not in the laundry basket, so we can't infer that it's in the laundry basket.\n\nIf the missing sock is in the laundry basket, then it's not under the bed, so we can infer that it's in the laundry basket.\n\nIf the missing sock is not under the bed and not in the laundry basket, then we can't infer that it's in the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket if and only if it's not under the bed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
