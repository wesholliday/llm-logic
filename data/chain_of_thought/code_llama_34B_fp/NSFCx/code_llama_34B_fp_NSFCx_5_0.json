However, it does not explicitly state that the snork can perform both actions simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The snork might gronk flonk and the snork might gronk flim\" from the given statement. The correct inference would be \"The snork might gronk flonk or the snork might gronk flim.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
