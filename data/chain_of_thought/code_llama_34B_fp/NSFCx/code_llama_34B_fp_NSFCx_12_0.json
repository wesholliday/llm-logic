However, it does not explicitly state that the zizz will perform both actions.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The zizz might blimple the fribble and the zizz might flimble the fribble.\" This inference would require additional information or context to support the idea that the zizz will perform both actions.\n\nAnswer: No.",
