In this case, the first statement is \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest,\" and the second statement is \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was in the forest.\" If the first statement is true, then the second statement must also be true, which means that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
