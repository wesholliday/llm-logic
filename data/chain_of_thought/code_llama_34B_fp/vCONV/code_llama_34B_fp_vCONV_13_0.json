The rule of contraposition states that if the premise is \"if A, then B\" and the conclusion is \"if B, then A\", then the argument is logically valid. In this case, the premise is \"if the car was red, then the truck was blue\" and the conclusion is \"if the truck was blue, then the car was red\", which follows the rule of contraposition.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
