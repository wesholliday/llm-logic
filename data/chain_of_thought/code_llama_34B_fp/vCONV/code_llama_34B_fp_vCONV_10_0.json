            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis argument is logically valid because it follows the rule of inference known as \"modus ponens.\" Modus ponens is a rule that allows us to deduce a conclusion from two premises, where the first premise is a conditional statement and the second premise is the antecedent of the conditional statement.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside,\" and the second premise is \"The dog was inside.\" From these two premises, we can deduce the conclusion \"The cat was outside\" using modus ponens.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
