            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis argument is logically valid because it follows the rule of contraposition. The rule of contraposition states that if a conditional statement is true, then the contrapositive of that statement is also true. In this case, the argument's premise is 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad', and the conclusion is 'If Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta'. The contrapositive of the premise is 'If Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta', which is logically equivalent to the conclusion. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
