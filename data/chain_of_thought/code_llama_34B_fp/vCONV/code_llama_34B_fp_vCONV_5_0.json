            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis argument is logically valid because it follows the rule of contraposition. The rule of contraposition states that if a conditional statement is true, then the contrapositive of that statement is also true. In this case, the argument's premise is \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis,\" and the conclusion is \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball.\" The contrapositive of the premise is \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis,\" which is logically equivalent to the conclusion. Therefore, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
