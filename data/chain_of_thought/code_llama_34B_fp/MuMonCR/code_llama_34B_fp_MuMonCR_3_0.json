The car could have been in the garage for other reasons, such as being parked or stored. However, the fact that it needed repairs is a necessary condition for it to have been in the garage, as it would not have been able to function properly without the repairs. Therefore, we can infer that the car must have needed repairs.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
