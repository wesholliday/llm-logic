This means that the package might arrive on either Monday or Tuesday, but not necessarily both.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The package might arrive on Monday and the package might arrive on Tuesday\" because this statement implies that the package will arrive on both Monday and Tuesday, which is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: No.",
