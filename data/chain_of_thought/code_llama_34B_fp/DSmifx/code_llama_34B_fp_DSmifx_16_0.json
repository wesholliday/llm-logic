The statement \"Either the sneg must be sproted or it is crampled\" means that the sneg is either sproted or crampled, but it cannot be both. Since we are also given the information that \"The sneg might not be sproted,\" we can conclude that the sneg is not sproted. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the sneg is crampled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
