This means that if the splat is not quanked, it must be morphed.\n\nSecond, we know that the splat might not be quanked. This means that there is a possibility that the splat is not quanked.\n\nCombining these two pieces of information, we can conclude that the splat is morphed. If the splat is not quanked, and it must be either quanked or morphed, then it must be morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
