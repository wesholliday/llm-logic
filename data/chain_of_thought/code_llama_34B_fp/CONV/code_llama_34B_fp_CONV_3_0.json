In this case, the statement is \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This means that if the book was indeed written by James, then it must be a mystery novel.\n\nHowever, the statement does not imply that if the book is a mystery novel, then it was written by James. In other words, there may be other authors who have written mystery novels, and this statement does not provide any information about those authors.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
