It suggests that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy would go to the zoo.\n\nHowever, the statement does not imply that if Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park. It is possible that Lucy went to the zoo for other reasons, or that she did not go to the zoo at all.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
