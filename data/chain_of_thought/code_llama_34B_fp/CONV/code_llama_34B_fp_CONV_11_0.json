In this case, the statement is \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This statement implies that there is a causal relationship between the cake being chocolate and the muffins being blueberry.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate\" from the given statement. This is because the given statement only implies a causal relationship in one direction, from the cake being chocolate to the muffins being blueberry. It does not imply a causal relationship in the opposite direction, from the muffins being blueberry to the cake being chocolate.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
