It implies that there is a causal relationship between the bear being in the case and the wolf being in the den. However, it does not provide any information about the converse relationship, i.e., whether the wolf being in the den implies the bear being in the case.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case\" from the given statement. The converse relationship is not logically implied by the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
