However, it does not imply that if Chris finished the race, then Alex also finished the race.\n\nTo infer that \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race,\" we would need additional information or a different statement. For example, if we know that Chris and Alex are identical twins, then we could infer that if Chris finished the race, then Alex also finished the race, because they are the same person.\n\nAnswer: No.",
