            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is a syllogism with the following form:\n\nAll A are B\nAll B are C\nTherefore, all A are C\n\nIn this case, the premises are:\n\nIf the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (Premise 1)\nThe mummy was awake (Premise 2)\n\nThe conclusion is:\nThe vampire was awake\n\nTo deduce the conclusion, we need to show that the premises logically entail the conclusion. In this case, we can see that the premises are both conditional statements, and the conclusion is a positive statement. Therefore, we need to use a form of reasoning that can handle conditional statements and deduce a positive statement from them.\n\nOne way to do this is to use a form of reasoning called \"modus ponens.\" Modus ponens is a form of reasoning that allows us to deduce a conclusion from two premises, where the first premise is a conditional statement and the second premise is the antecedent of the conditional statement. In this case, the first premise is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" and the second premise is \"The mummy was awake.\" Using modus ponens, we can deduce the conclusion \"The vampire was awake.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
