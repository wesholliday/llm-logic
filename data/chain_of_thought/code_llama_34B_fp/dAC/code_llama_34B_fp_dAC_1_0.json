            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement. It expresses a cause-and-effect relationship between Mary's attendance at the wedding and Sue's attendance at the wedding. The statement \"Sue was at the wedding\" is a statement of fact, indicating that Sue did attend the wedding.\n\nTo deduce \"Mary was at the wedding\" from the given information, we need to use the principle of modus ponens. This principle states that if a conditional statement is true and the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is true, then the consequent (the \"then\" part) must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is true, and the antecedent \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true (since Sue was at the wedding). Therefore, we can deduce that the consequent \"Sue was at the wedding\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
