            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is a conditional statement. It expresses a cause-and-effect relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo. The statement \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is a factual statement that simply states that Lucy did indeed go to the zoo.\n\nTo deduce \"Joe went to the park\" from these two statements, we need to use the principle of modus ponens. This principle states that if a conditional statement is true and the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is true, then the consequent (the \"then\" part) must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is true, and the factual statement \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is also true. Therefore, we can deduce that \"Joe went to the park\" must also be true, since it is the antecedent of the conditional statement that led to the conclusion that \"Lucy went to the zoo\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
