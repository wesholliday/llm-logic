The statement \"Kate ate salad\" is a separate statement that is not connected to the conditional statement.\n\nTo deduce \"Ben ate pasta\" from the given information, we need to determine whether the antecedent (Ben ate pasta) is true. Since we do not have any direct evidence that Ben ate pasta, we cannot deduce that he did. Therefore, the answer is no, we cannot deduce \"Ben ate pasta\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
