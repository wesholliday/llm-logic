            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is an example of a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that uses a set of premises to reach a conclusion. In this case, the premises are \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" and \"The truck was metal.\" The conclusion is \"The doll was plastic.\"\n\nTo deduce the conclusion from the premises, we need to use the principle of modus ponens, which states that if a conditional statement (if...then) is true and the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true, then the consequent (the part after the \"then\") must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" The antecedent is \"The truck was metal.\" Since we know that the truck was metal, we can conclude that the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
