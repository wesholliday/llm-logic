This means that the griffin's presence in the forest is a necessary condition for the unicorn's presence in the forest.\n\nThe second premise states that the unicorn was in the forest. Since the unicorn's presence in the forest is a necessary condition for the griffin's presence in the forest, we can conclude that the griffin was also in the forest.\n\nTherefore, we can deduce 'The griffin was in the forest' from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
