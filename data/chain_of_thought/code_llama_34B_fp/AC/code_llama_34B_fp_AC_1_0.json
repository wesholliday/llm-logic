The first premise, 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', implies that Mary's presence at the wedding is a necessary condition for Sue's presence. The second premise, 'Sue was at the wedding', provides evidence that Sue was indeed present at the wedding. Therefore, we can conclude that Mary was also present at the wedding, as her absence would have prevented Sue from attending.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
