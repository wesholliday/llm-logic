            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement. It expresses a cause-and-effect relationship between the apple being red and the banana being yellow. The statement \"The banana was yellow\" provides evidence that the banana was indeed yellow.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"The apple was red\" from these statements, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. In this case, the first statement is a conditional statement, and the second statement is a statement of fact.\n\nIf the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\nThe banana was yellow.\n\nBased on the information provided, we can infer that the apple was red. This is because the conditional statement provides a logical connection between the apple being red and the banana being yellow. Since we know that the banana was yellow, and the conditional statement tells us that if the apple was red, then the banana would be yellow, we can logically conclude that the apple was red.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
