However, it does not explicitly state that the blimp must perform both actions.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the blimp must gribble a flonk or it must gribble a wibble snorkel. The correct inference is that the blimp must gribble a flonk or gribble a wibble snorkel, but it does not have to do both.\n\nAnswer: No.",
