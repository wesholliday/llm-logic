However, it does not explicitly state that the floob must do one or the other, but rather that it must do one of the two options.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the floob must quorple a zizz or it must quorple a zump. The statement only implies that the floob must do one of the two options, but it does not explicitly state that it must do one or the other.\n\nAnswer: No.",
