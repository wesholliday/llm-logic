The two statements are:\n\n1. The blimp must be wump by the frazzle blimple.\n2. The blimp must be wump by the plimp.\n\nTo infer that \"The blimp must be wump by the frazzle blimple or it must be wump by the plimp,\" we need to show that the two statements are logically equivalent.\n\nWe can do this by using a technique called \"logical equivalence.\" This involves showing that the two statements have the same meaning, even if they are not literally the same.\n\nTo do this, we can use a technique called \"logical equivalence.\" This involves showing that the two statements have the same meaning, even if they are not literally the same.\n\nWe can do this by using a technique called \"logical equivalence.\" This involves showing that the two statements have the same meaning, even if they are not literally the same.\n\nWe can do this by using a technique called \"logical equivalence.\" This involves showing that the two statements have the same meaning, even if they are not literally the same.\n\nWe can do this by using a technique called \"logical equivalence.\" This involves showing that the two statements have the same meaning, even if they are not literally the same.\n\nWe can do this by using a technique called \"logical equivalence.\" This involves showing that the two statements have the same meaning, even if they are not literally the same.\n\nWe can do this by using a technique called \"logical equivalence.\" This involves showing that the two statements have the same meaning, even if they are not literally the same.\n\nWe can do this by using a technique called \"logical equivalence.\" This involves showing that the two statements have the same meaning, even if they are not literally the same.\n\nWe can do this by using a technique called \"logical equivalence.\" This involves showing that the two statements have the same meaning, even if they are not literally the same.\n\nWe can do this by using a technique called \"logical equivalence.\" This involves showing that the two statements have the same meaning, even if they are not literally the same.\n\nWe can do this by using a technique called \"logical equivalence.\" This involves showing that the two statements have the same meaning, even if they are not literally the same.\n\nWe can do this by using a technique called \"logical equivalence.\" This involves showing that the two statements have the same meaning, even if they are not literally the same.\n\nWe can do this by using a technique called \"logical equivalence.\" This involves showing that the two statements have the same meaning, even if they are not literally the same.\n\nWe can do this by using a technique called \"logical equivalence.\" This involves showing that the two statements have the same meaning, even if they are not literally the same.\n\nWe can do this by using a technique called \"logical equivalence.\" This involves showing that the two statements have the same meaning, even if they are not literally the same.\n\nWe can do this by using a technique called \"logical equivalence.\" This involves showing that the two statements have the same meaning, even if they are not literally the same.\n\nWe can do this by using a technique called \"logical equivalence.\" This involves showing that the two statements have the same meaning, even if they are not literally the same.\n\nWe can do this by using a technique called \"logical equivalence.\" This involves showing that the two statements have the same meaning, even if they are not literally the same.\n\nWe can do this by using a technique called \"logical equivalence.\" This involves showing that the two statements have the same meaning, even if they are not literally the same.\n\nWe can do this by using a technique called \"logical equivalence.\" This involves showing that the two statements have the same meaning, even if they are not literally the same.\n\nWe can do this by using a technique called \"logical equivalence.\" This involves showing that the two statements have the same meaning, even if they are not literally the same.\n\nWe can do this by using a technique called \"logical equivalence.\" This involves showing that the two statements have the same meaning, even if they are not literally the same.\n\nWe can do this by using a technique called \"logical equivalence.\" This involves showing that the two statements have the same meaning, even if they are not literally the same.\n\nWe can do this by using a technique called \"logical equivalence.\" This involves showing that the two statements have the same meaning, even",
