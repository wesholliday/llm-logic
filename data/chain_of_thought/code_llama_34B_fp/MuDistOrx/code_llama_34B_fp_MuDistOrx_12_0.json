It can be represented as:\n\nPremise 1: The quibble must be floob on the froodle.\nPremise 2: The quibble must be snork on the zump.\nConclusion: The quibble must be floob on the froodle or it must be snork on the zump.\n\nFrom the premises, we can infer the conclusion. The conclusion is a disjunction of the two premises, which means that at least one of the premises must be true. In this case, the conclusion is \"The quibble must be floob on the froodle or it must be snork on the zump,\" which means that either the quibble must be floob on the froodle or it must be snork on the zump.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
