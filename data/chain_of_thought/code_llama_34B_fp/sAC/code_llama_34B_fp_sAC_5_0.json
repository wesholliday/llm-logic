In this case, we have two premises:\n\n1. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n2. Amy played tennis.\n\nFrom these premises, we can conclude that Jeff played basketball. This is because the first premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy would play tennis. Since Amy did play tennis, we can infer that Jeff must have played basketball.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
