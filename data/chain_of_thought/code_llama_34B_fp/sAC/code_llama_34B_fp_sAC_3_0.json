            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis is a classic example of a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that uses a set of statements to reach a conclusion. In this case, we have two premises:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n2. The book is a mystery novel.\n\nWe want to know if it follows that the book was written by James. To determine this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Look at the first premise and identify the conclusion that it reaches. In this case, the conclusion is \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n2. Look at the second premise and identify the conclusion that it reaches. In this case, the conclusion is also \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n3. Check if the conclusion of the first premise is the same as the conclusion of the second premise. In this case, they are the same, so we can conclude that the book is a mystery novel.\n4. Now, we need to check if the conclusion we have reached is true. In this case, we have concluded that the book is a mystery novel, which is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
