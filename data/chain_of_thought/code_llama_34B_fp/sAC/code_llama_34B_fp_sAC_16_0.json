In this case, we have two premises:\n\n1. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n2. The pants were denim.\n\nFrom these premises, we can conclude that the shirt was cotton. This is because the first premise states that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants would be denim. Since we know that the pants are denim, we can infer that the shirt must be cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
