This means that the vampire's awakening is a necessary condition for the mummy's awakening.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the mummy must have been awake. This means that the mummy's awakening is not a necessary condition for the vampire's awakening.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the vampire was not awake, because if it was awake, then the mummy must have been awake, but we know that the mummy was not awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
