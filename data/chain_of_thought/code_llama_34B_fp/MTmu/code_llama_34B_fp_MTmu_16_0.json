            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is an example of a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that uses a set of premises to reach a conclusion. The first premise is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim,\" and the second premise is \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"The shirt was not cotton\" from these premises, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument. The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is true if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is false or the consequent (the part after the \"then\") is true. In this case, the antecedent is \"the shirt was cotton\" and the consequent is \"the pants must have been denim.\"\n\nThe second premise is a negation of the consequent of the first premise, which means that it is true if the consequent is false. In this case, the consequent is \"the pants must have been denim,\" and the negation of this statement is \"the pants were not denim.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion \"The shirt was not cotton.\" This conclusion is not explicitly stated in either of the premises, but it can be inferred from the information given in the premises. If the pants were not denim, then the shirt must not have been cotton, because the first premise states that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The shirt was not cotton\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
