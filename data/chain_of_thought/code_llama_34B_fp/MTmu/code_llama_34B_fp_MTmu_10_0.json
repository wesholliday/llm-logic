This means that if the dog was inside, the cat could not have been inside.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the cat must have been outside. This means that the cat was not outside.\n\nSince the cat was not outside, and the dog was inside, we can conclude that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
