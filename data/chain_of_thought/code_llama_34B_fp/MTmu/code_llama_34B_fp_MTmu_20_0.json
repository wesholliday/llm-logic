            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is an example of a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that uses a set of premises to reach a conclusion. In this case, the premises are:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\n2. It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer that the apple was not red. This is because the first premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. However, the second premise states that it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow. Therefore, we can conclude that the apple was not red, because if it had been red, then the banana would have had to be yellow, but we know that the banana is not yellow.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
