            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is an example of a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that uses a set of premises to reach a conclusion. The first premise is \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal,\" and the second premise is \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"The doll was not plastic\" from these premises, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument. The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is true if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is false or the consequent (the part after the \"then\") is true. In this case, the antecedent is \"the doll was plastic\" and the consequent is \"the truck must have been metal.\"\n\nThe second premise is a negation of the consequent of the first premise, which means that it is true if the consequent is false. In this case, the negation of \"the truck must have been metal\" is \"the truck must not have been metal.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion \"The doll was not plastic.\" This conclusion is a negation of the antecedent of the first premise, which means that it is true if the antecedent is false. In this case, the negation of \"the doll was plastic\" is \"the doll was not plastic.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure of the argument, we can infer \"The doll was not plastic\" from the premises \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\" and \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
