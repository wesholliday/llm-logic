It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball. This is because the first statement implies that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. However, the second statement states that it's not the case that Amy must have played tennis. Therefore, we can conclude that Jeff did not play basketball, because if he had, then Amy would have had to play tennis, but she didn't.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
