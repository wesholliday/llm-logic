It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train. (Premise 2)\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane. This is because the first premise states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. However, the second premise states that it's not the case that Erin must have taken a train. This means that the condition stated in the first premise (i.e., if Sam took a plane) is not true, and therefore Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
