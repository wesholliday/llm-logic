It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that the bear was not in the cave. This is because the first statement implies that the bear's presence in the cave is a necessary condition for the wolf to be in the den. However, the second statement asserts that the wolf is not in the den, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, we can conclude that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
