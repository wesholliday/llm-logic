It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. (Premise 2)\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer that Tom did not watch football. This is because the first premise states that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. However, the second premise states that it's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. This means that the antecedent of the first premise (Tom watching football) is false, which implies that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
