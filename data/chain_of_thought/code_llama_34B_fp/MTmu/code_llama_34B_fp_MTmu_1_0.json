            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is an example of a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that uses a set of premises to reach a conclusion. In this case, the premises are:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\n2. It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\n\nThe conclusion that can be drawn from these premises is that Mary was not at the wedding. This is because the first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. However, the second premise states that it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. Therefore, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding, because if she had been, then Sue would have had to be there as well.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
