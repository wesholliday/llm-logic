The grommet plopped the frink.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that the grommet was sploffed. This is because the first statement implies a causal relationship between the grommet being sploffed and the grommet plopping the frink. Since the grommet plopped the frink, and the first statement implies that the grommet plopped the frink only if it was sploffed, we can conclude that the grommet was sploffed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
