If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\n2. The whiffle tinked.\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer that the whiffle was shanked. This is because the first premise states that if the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked. Since we know that the whiffle tinked (from the second premise), we can conclude that the whiffle was shanked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
