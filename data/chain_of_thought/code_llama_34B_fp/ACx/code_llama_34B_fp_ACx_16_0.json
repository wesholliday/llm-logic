The sneg sproted the frink.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that the sneg was crampled. This is because the first statement implies that the sneg sproted the frink only if the sneg was crampled. Since the second statement simply states that the sneg sproted the frink, it does not provide any information about whether the sneg was crampled or not. Therefore, we can conclude that the sneg was crampled based on the first statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
