The smip lupped the zoint.\n\nWe can infer that the smip was shripped because the first statement implies a causal relationship between the smip being shripped and the smip lupping the zoint. If the smip was not shripped, then the smip would not have lupped the zoint. Therefore, since the smip did lupped the zoint, we can conclude that the smip must have been shripped.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
