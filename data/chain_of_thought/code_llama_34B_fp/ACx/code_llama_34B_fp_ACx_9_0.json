The twonk was varnished.\n\nWe can infer that the twonk was plinked because the first statement implies a causal relationship between being plinked and being varnished. If the twonk was varnished, then it must have been plinked first, since the only way for it to be varnished is if it was plinked. Therefore, we can conclude that the twonk was plinked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
