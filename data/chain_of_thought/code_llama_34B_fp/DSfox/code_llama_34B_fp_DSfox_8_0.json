            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe can infer 'The sprocket is cranked' from the given premises because the first premise, 'The sprocket is not daggled', implies that the sprocket is not in the state of being daggled. The second premise, 'Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked', provides us with two options for the state of the sprocket: either it is daggled or it is cranked. Since we have already established that the sprocket is not daggled, the only remaining option is that it is cranked. Therefore, we can infer 'The sprocket is cranked'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
