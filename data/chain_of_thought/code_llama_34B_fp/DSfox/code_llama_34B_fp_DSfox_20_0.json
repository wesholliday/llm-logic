The statement \"Either the fleeg is surned or it is bluttered\" means that the fleeg is either in the state of being surned or in the state of being bluttered, but not both.\n\nSince the fleeg is not in the state of being surned, and it is either in the state of being surned or bluttered, it must be in the state of being bluttered. Therefore, we can infer \"The fleeg is bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
