The second premise, 'Either the flob is movated or it is skizzled', states that the flob is either in a state of motion or it is skizzled. Since the flob is not in a state of motion (as per the first premise), it must be skizzled (as per the second premise).\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The flob is skizzled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
