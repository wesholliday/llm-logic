The second premise, 'Either the glip is tragged or it is slogged', provides us with two exclusive options for the state of the glip: either it is tragged or it is slogged. Since we have already established that the glip is not tragged, the only remaining option is that it is slogged. Therefore, we can infer 'The glip is slogged'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
