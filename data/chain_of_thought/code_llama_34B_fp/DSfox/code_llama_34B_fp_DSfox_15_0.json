This statement is saying that the dreb (whatever that is) is not spent or used up.\n\nThe statement \"Either the dreb is spened or it is vroombed\" can be translated to \"Either the dreb is spent or it is vroombed\" in English. This statement is saying that the dreb is either spent or vroombed, but it does not say anything about the dreb being not spent.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot infer \"The dreb is vroombed\" because the second statement only says that the dreb is either spent or vroombed, and it does not say anything about the dreb being vroombed.\n\nAnswer: No.",
