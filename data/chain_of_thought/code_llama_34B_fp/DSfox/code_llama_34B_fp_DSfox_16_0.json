The second premise, 'Either the sneg is sproted or it is crampled', provides us with two options: either the sneg is sproted or it is crampled. Since we have already established that the sneg is not sproted, we can conclude that it must be crampled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The sneg is crampled' from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
