Either the smip is lupped or it is shripped.\n\nTo infer 'The smip is shripped', we need to show that the first statement implies the second statement.\n\nWe can start by analyzing the first statement: \"The smip is not lupped.\" This statement can be translated as \"It is not the case that the smip is lupped.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the second statement: \"Either the smip is lupped or it is shripped.\" This statement can be translated as \"It is not the case that the smip is lupped and it is not the case that the smip is shripped.\"\n\nNow, let's see if we can infer 'The smip is shripped' from the given statements. We can do this by using logical reasoning to show that the first statement implies the second statement.\n\nTo do this, we can use a proof by contradiction. We assume that the smip is not shripped, and then we show that this leads to a contradiction.\n\nAssume that the smip is not shripped. This means that it is not the case that the smip is shripped.\n\nNow, we can use the first statement to infer that the smip is not lupped. This is because if the smip is not lupped, then it is not the case that the smip is lupped and it is not the case that the smip is shripped.\n\nBut this is a contradiction, because we have already assumed that the smip is not shripped. Therefore, our assumption that the smip is not shripped must be false, and we can conclude that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
