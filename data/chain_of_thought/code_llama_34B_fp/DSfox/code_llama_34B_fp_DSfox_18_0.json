The second premise, 'Either the shank is nugged or it is plooked', is a disjunction that states that the shank is either in the state of being nugged or in the state of being plooked.\n\nSince the shank is not nugged, it must be in the state of being plooked, as there are no other possible states. Therefore, we can infer 'The shank is plooked'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
