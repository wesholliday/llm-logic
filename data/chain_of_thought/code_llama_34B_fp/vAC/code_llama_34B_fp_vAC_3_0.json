The first premise states that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. The second premise states that the book is a mystery novel. Therefore, if the book was written by James, it must be a mystery novel. This means that the conclusion, \"The book was written by James,\" follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
