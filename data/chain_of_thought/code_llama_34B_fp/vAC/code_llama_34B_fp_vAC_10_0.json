Modus ponens is a valid argument form that consists of two premises and a conclusion. The first premise states that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. The second premise states that the cat was outside. Therefore, based on the first premise, we can conclude that the dog was inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
