The first premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis, but it does not state that Jeff played basketball. The second premise states that Amy played tennis, but it does not state that Jeff played basketball. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that Jeff played basketball.\n\nAnswer: No",
