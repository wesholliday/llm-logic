The first premise states that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter, but it does not state that the alien visited Mars. The second premise states that the robot visited Jupiter, but it does not state that the alien visited Mars. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that the alien visited Mars based on these premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
