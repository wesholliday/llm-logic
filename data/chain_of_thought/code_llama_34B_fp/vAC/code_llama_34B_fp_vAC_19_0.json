The first premise states that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball, but it does not state that Tom watched football. The second premise states that Jen watched basketball, but it does not state that Tom watched football. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that Tom watched football.\n\nAnswer: No",
