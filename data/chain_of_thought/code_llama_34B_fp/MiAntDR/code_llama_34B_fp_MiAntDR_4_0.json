The phrase \"might be at 2 PM or cancelled\" suggests that there are two possible outcomes for the meeting: it might be held at 2 PM, or it might be cancelled. Since the information does not specify that the meeting will definitely be held at 2 PM, it is possible that it might be cancelled instead. Therefore, we can infer that the meeting might be cancelled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
