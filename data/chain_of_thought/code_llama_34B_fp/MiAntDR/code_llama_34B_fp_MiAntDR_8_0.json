This is because the statement mentions two possible scenarios: the restaurant being closed on Mondays and the restaurant being open for limited hours. Since we are not given any information about the restaurant's hours of operation on other days, we can infer that the restaurant might be open for limited hours on those days as well.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
