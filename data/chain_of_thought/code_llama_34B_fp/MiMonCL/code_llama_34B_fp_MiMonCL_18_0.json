This suggests that the performance is not a fixed, pre-determined event, but rather a dynamic and flexible one that can be shaped by the presence of guest artists. Improvisation is a common technique used in live performances to create a sense of spontaneity and unpredictability, and it is consistent with the idea of a performance that is shaped by the presence of guest artists.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
