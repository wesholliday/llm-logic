The glip might not have tragged.\n\nTo infer 'The glip was not slogged', we need to show that the first premise is false. We can do this by showing that the second premise is true, even if the first premise is false.\n\nIn this case, the second premise is 'The glip might not have tragged', which is a true statement. This means that even if the first premise is false, the second premise is still true. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The glip was not slogged' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No.",
