If the sneg was crampled and sproted the frink, then we would expect the statement \"The sneg might not have sproted the frink\" to be false. However, since the statement is true, it means that the sneg did not necessarily sprot the frink, which implies that the sneg was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
