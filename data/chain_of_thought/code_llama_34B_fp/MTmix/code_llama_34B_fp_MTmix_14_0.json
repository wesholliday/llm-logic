The clug might not have been snugged.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that the clug was not fleeked. This is because the first statement implies that if the clug was fleeked, then it must have been snugged. However, the second statement suggests that the clug might not have been snugged. This means that the clug was not fleeked, because if it had been fleeked, it would have had to be snugged, but it is possible that it was not snugged.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
