The first premise is \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked.\" This means that if the splat was morphed, it is certain that the splat quanked.\n\nThe second premise is \"The splat might not have quanked.\" This means that there is a possibility that the splat did not quank, even if it was morphed.\n\nThe conclusion is \"The splat was not morphed.\" This means that the splat was not in a morphed state.\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nIf the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked. But we don't know if the splat quanked or not. So, we can't conclude that the splat was morphed. Therefore, the argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
