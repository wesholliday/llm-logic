The smip might not have lupped the zoint.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that the smip was not shripped. This is because the first statement implies that the smip must have lupped the zoint if it was shripped, but the second statement suggests that the smip might not have lupped the zoint. If the smip was shripped, then it must have lupped the zoint, but the second statement suggests that this might not be the case. Therefore, we can conclude that the smip was not shripped.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
