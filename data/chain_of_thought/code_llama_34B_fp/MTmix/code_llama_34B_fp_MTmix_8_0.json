However, the second premise suggests that the sprocket might not have been daggled. This creates a logical contradiction, which means that the premises cannot both be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked, because the premises are logically inconsistent.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
