The first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. The second premise states that Mary was not at the wedding. However, this does not necessarily mean that Sue was not at the wedding. The conclusion that Sue was not at the wedding is not supported by the premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
