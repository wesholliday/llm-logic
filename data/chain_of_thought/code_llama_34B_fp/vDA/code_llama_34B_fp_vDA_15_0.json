The first premise states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. The second premise states that Sam did not take a plane. However, this does not necessarily mean that Erin did not take a train. The conclusion is based on a false assumption that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\n\nAnswer: No",
