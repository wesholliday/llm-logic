The first premise establishes a conditional relationship between the cake being chocolate and the muffins being blueberry. However, the second premise states that the cake was not chocolate, which means that the conditional relationship established in the first premise does not apply. Therefore, the conclusion that the muffins were not blueberry is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: No",
