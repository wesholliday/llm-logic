The first premise states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy would go to the zoo. The second premise states that Joe did not go to the park. However, this does not necessarily mean that Lucy did not go to the zoo. It is possible that Lucy went to the zoo even if Joe did not go to the park. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises, and the argument is not valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
