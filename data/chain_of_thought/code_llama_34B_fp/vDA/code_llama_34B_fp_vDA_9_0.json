            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis argument is not logically valid. The first premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. The second premise states that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Based on these two premises, we can conclude that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. However, this conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThe reason for this is that the first premise does not guarantee that Mark will buy the blue shirt if Lisa buys the red shirt. It is possible that Mark will buy the blue shirt regardless of whether Lisa buys the red shirt or not. Therefore, the conclusion that Mark did not buy the blue shirt is not necessarily true based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
