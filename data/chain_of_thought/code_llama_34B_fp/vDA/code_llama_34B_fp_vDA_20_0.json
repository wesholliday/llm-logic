The first premise establishes a conditional relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana, but the second premise only states that the apple was not red. It does not provide any information about the color of the banana. Therefore, the conclusion that the banana was not yellow cannot be logically deduced from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
