The first premise establishes a conditional relationship between the alien's visit to Mars and the robot's visit to Jupiter. However, the second premise states that the alien did not visit Mars, which means that the conditional relationship established in the first premise is not satisfied. Therefore, the conclusion that the robot did not visit Jupiter cannot be drawn.\n\nAnswer: No",
