The first premise states that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. The second premise states that the book was not written by James. However, this does not mean that the book is not a mystery novel. It is possible that the book was written by someone else and is still a mystery novel. Therefore, the conclusion that the book is not a mystery novel is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: No",
