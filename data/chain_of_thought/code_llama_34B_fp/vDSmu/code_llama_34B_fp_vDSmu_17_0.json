The first premise states that either the scarf is stuffed in the backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack. The second premise states that it's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack. Therefore, the only possible conclusion is that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
