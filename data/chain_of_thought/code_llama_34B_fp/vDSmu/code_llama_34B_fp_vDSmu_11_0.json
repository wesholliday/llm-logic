The first premise states that either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch, and the second premise states that it's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch. Therefore, the only possible conclusion is that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
