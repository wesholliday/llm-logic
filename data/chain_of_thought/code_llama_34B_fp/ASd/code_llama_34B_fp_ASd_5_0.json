However, this statement does not necessarily imply that the services will continue if the bill is paid and the check bounces.\n\nIn this scenario, the check bouncing could be a result of a mistake or an error, rather than a deliberate attempt to avoid paying the bill. In such a case, the services may still be able to continue, even if the check bounces.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the bill is paid and the check bounces, then the services will continue\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
