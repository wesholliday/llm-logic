However, this statement does not necessarily imply that the relationship between exercise and weight loss is linear or that it will hold true in all cases.\n\nIn the case of \"If I exercise and eat junk food, I will lose weight,\" we are adding an additional factor (eating junk food) to the equation. This factor could potentially have a negative impact on weight loss, as junk food is typically high in calories and low in nutrients. Therefore, it is unlikely that adding junk food to the equation will result in weight loss, and it is more likely that it will hinder weight loss efforts.\n\nAnswer: No.",
