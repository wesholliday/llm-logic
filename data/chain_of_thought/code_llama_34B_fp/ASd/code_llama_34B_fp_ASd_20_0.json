However, the statement \"If I take medication that expired, I will feel better\" is not necessarily true.\n\nThe expiration date on medication is an indicator of its shelf life, and it is important to follow this date to ensure the medication is safe and effective. Taking expired medication may not have the desired effect, and it may even be harmful.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If I take medication that expired, I will feel better\" from \"If I take medication, I will feel better.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
