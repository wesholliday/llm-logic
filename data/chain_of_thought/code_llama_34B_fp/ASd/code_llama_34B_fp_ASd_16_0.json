However, it does not imply that fertilizing the lawn is a sufficient condition for the lawn to be lush and green. In other words, there may be other factors that contribute to the lawn being lush and green, such as adequate watering, sunlight, and soil quality.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If I fertilize the lawn and there is a drought, it will be lush and green.\" The drought could potentially hinder the lawn's ability to thrive, regardless of whether it is fertilized or not.\n\nAnswer: No.",
