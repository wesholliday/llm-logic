However, the statement does not explicitly mention the pilot light.\n\nIf the pilot light is out, it is possible that the oven is not functioning properly, and therefore the kitchen may not be warm. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
