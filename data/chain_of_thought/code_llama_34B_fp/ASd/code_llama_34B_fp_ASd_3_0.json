However, if the garage is flooding, it may not be safe for the car to be in the garage anymore. The flooding could cause damage to the car or make it difficult to access.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the car is in the garage and the garage is flooding, then it is safe\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
