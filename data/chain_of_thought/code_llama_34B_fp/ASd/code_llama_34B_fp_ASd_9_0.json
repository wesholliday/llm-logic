This is because the statement \"If the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A\" only implies a correlation between the two, not a causal relationship. In other words, the statement only means that in general, well-written essays tend to result in high grades, but it does not guarantee that a well-written essay will always result in an A, especially if it is turned in late.\n\nAnswer: No.",
