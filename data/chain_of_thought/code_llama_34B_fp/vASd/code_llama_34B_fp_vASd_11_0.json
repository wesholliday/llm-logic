The premise states that if you get enough sleep, you won't be tired. However, the conclusion states that if you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired. The conclusion adds an additional condition, which is not implied by the premise. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
