The premise states that if I charge my phone, it will have power, but the conclusion states that if I charge my phone and it has a dead battery, it will have power. The conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise because the premise only states that charging the phone will give it power, it does not guarantee that the phone will have power if it has a dead battery. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
