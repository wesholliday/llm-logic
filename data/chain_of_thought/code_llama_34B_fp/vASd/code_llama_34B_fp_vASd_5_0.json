The premise states that if the bill is paid, then the services will continue. However, the conclusion states that if the bill is paid and the check bounces, then the services will continue. This conclusion is not necessarily true, as the services may still be discontinued even if the bill is paid and the check bounces. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
