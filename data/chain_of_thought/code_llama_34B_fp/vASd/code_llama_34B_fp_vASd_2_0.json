The premise only states that if we go to the concert, we'll have a good time, but it does not guarantee that we'll have a good time if a bomb goes off. In fact, the presence of a bomb would likely ruin the concert and make it a terrible experience, regardless of whether we go or not.\n\nAnswer: No.",
