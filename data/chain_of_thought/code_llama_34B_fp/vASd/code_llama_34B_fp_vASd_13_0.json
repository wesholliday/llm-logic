The premise states that exercising will lead to weight loss, but the conclusion states that exercising and eating junk food will also lead to weight loss. However, eating junk food can actually prevent weight loss, as it can lead to consuming more calories than the body burns. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
