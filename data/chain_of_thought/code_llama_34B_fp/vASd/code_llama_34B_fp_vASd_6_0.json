The premise states that screaming will hurt the person's ears, but the conclusion states that screaming and wearing earplugs will also hurt the person's ears. This is not necessarily true, as wearing earplugs can protect the ears from the harmful effects of screaming. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
