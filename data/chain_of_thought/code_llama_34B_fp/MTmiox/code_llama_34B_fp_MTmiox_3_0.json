If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that the splat was not morphed. This is because if the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked, according to the second statement. However, the first statement suggests that the splat might not have quanked. This creates a contradiction, which means that the assumption that the splat was morphed must be false. Therefore, we can conclude that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
