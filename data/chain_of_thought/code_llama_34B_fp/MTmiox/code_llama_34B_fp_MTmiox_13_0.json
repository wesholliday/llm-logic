If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged.\n\nTo infer 'The glip was not slogged', we need to show that the negation of the second statement is true. The negation of the second statement is:\n\n'The glip was not slogged or the glip did not tragged.'\n\nWe can see that the first statement implies that the glip might not have tragged, which means that the glip did not tragged. Therefore, the negation of the second statement is true, and we can infer that 'The glip was not slogged'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
