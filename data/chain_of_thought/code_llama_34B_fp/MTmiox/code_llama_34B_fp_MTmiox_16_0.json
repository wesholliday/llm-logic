If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink.\n\nTo infer 'The sneg was not crampled', we need to show that the negation of the second statement is true. The negation of the second statement is:\n\n2. The sneg was not crampled or the sneg did not sprot the frink.\n\nWe can see that the first statement implies the second statement, so if the first statement is true, then the second statement must also be true. Therefore, we can infer that 'The sneg was not crampled' is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
