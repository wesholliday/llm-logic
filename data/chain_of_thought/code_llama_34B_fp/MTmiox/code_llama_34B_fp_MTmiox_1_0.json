If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that the flugel was not blimmed. This is because if the flugel was blimmed, then it must have been zargled, according to the second statement. However, the first statement suggests that the flugel might not have been zargled. Therefore, the only possible conclusion is that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
