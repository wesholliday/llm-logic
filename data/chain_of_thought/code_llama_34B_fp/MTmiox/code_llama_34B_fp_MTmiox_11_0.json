If the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed.\n\nTo infer 'The flug was not blummed', we need to show that the negation of 'The flug was blummed' is true.\n\nNegation of 'The flug was blummed' is 'The flug was not blummed'.\n\nWe can infer 'The flug was not blummed' from the given statements as follows:\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the flug might not have been zimmed.\nFrom statement 2, we know that if the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed.\n\nIf the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed, as per statement 2.\n\nTherefore, if the flug was blummed, it cannot have been not blummed.\n\nSo, we can infer that the flug was not blummed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
