If the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that the smip was not shripped. This is because if the smip was shripped, then it must have lupped the zoint, according to the second statement. However, the first statement states that the smip might not have lupped the zoint. This means that the smip was not shripped, because if it was shripped, it would have lupped the zoint, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
