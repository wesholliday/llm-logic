This means that the twonk is either varnished or plinked, but we don't know which one it is.\n\nThe second premise states that 'The twonk is not plinked'. This means that the twonk is not plinked, but we still don't know whether it is varnished or not.\n\nHowever, since the twonk is not plinked, it must be varnished. Therefore, we can infer 'The twonk is varnished'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
