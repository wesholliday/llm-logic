The first premise states that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. However, the second premise only states that the bear was in the cave, without any information about the wolf. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the wolf was in the den based solely on the information provided in the premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
