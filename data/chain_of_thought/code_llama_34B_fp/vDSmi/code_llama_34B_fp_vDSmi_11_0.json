The first premise states that either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch. The second premise states that the newspaper might not be sitting on the porch. Therefore, if the newspaper is not sitting on the porch, it must be in the driveway. This is the conclusion of the argument.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
