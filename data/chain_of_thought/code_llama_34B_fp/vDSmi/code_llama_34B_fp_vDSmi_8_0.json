The first premise states that the remote control is either on the coffee table or hiding under the couch, but the second premise states that the remote control might not be hiding under the couch. This means that the only possibility left is that the remote control is on the coffee table, but this does not necessarily mean that it is on the coffee table. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
