The first premise states that Fido is either inside or in the garden, but the second premise states that Fido might not be in the garden. This means that the only possibility left is that Fido is inside, but this is not necessarily true. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises, and the argument is not valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
