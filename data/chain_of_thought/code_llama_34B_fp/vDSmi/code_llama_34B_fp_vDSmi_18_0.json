The first premise states that either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand. The second premise states that the notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand. Therefore, based on the first premise, if the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand, it must be in the drawer. This conclusion follows logically from the premises, making the argument valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
