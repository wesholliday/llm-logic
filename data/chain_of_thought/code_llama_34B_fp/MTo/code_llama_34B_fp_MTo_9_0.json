The second premise, 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt', is a conditional statement that implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark would have bought the blue shirt.\n\nSince we know that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, and the only way for Lisa to buy the red shirt is if Mark buys the blue shirt, we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
