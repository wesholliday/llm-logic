The second premise, 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den', tells us that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf would be in the den.\n\nSince the wolf was not in the den, and if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf would be in the den, we can conclude that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
