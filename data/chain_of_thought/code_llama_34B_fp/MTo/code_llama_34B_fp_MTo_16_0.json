The second premise, 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim', tells us that if the shirt was made of cotton, then the pants would be made of denim.\n\nSince we know that the pants were not made of denim, and if the shirt was made of cotton, then the pants would be made of denim, we can conclude that the shirt was not made of cotton. Therefore, the answer is 'yes'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
