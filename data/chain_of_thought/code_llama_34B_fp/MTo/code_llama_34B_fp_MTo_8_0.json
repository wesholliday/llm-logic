The second premise, 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake', tells us that if the vampire was in a state of being awake, then the mummy would also be in a state of being awake.\n\nSince we know that the mummy was not awake, and the second premise tells us that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would be awake, we can conclude that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
