The second premise, 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue', tells us that if the car was red, then the truck would be blue.\n\nSince the truck was not blue, we can conclude that the car was not red. If the car had been red, then the truck would have been blue, but since the truck was not blue, we know that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
