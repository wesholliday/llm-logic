The second premise, 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside', implies that if the dog was inside, the cat would be outside.\n\nSince the cat was not outside, and if the dog was inside, the cat would be outside, we can conclude that the dog must have been inside. Therefore, we can infer 'The dog was inside'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
