The second premise, 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest', tells us that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn would also be in the forest.\n\nSince we know that the unicorn was not in the forest, and the second premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn would also be in the forest, we can conclude that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
