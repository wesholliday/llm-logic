The second premise, 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', tells us that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue would have also attended the wedding.\n\nSince Sue did not attend the wedding, and if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue would have also attended the wedding, we can conclude that Mary did not attend the wedding. Therefore, the answer is 'yes'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
