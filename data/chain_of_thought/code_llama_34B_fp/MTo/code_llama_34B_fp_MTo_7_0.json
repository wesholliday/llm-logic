The second premise, \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race,\" tells us that if Alex did finish the race, then Chris would have also finished the race.\n\nSince we know that Chris did not finish the race, and if Alex had finished the race, then Chris would have finished the race, we can conclude that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
