However, the antecedent is not necessarily true, as we do not have any information about whether the alien visited Mars.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion: \"The alien did not visit Mars.\" This statement is the negation of the antecedent, which means that if the alien did not visit Mars, then the consequent (the robot visited Jupiter) must also be false. However, we do not have enough information to determine whether the robot visited Jupiter or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we cannot infer \"The alien did not visit Mars.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
