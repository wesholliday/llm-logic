The first premise, \"Bob did not choose pasta,\" tells us that Bob did not select pasta as his entree. The second premise, \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta,\" is a conditional statement that implies that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob would have chosen pasta. However, we know that Bob did not choose pasta, so it is impossible for Sue to have chosen pizza. Therefore, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
