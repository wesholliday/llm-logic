Guided tours are often included in premium or luxury vacation packages because they provide a unique and personalized experience for the traveler. Additionally, the fact that the vacation might include guided tours does not necessarily mean that it will be expensive, as the cost of the guided tours could be included in the overall cost of the vacation.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
