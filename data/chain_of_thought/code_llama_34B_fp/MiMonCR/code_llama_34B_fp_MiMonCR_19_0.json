This suggests that the possibility of the discovery leading to a Nobel Prize is not certain, but it is a possibility. Additionally, the word \"accidental\" does not necessarily imply that the discovery is not significant or important, and it is possible that the discovery could still be recognized with a Nobel Prize.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
