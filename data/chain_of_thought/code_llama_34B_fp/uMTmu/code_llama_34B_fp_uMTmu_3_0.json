The statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel\" is a conditional statement, which means that it is not necessarily true. The statement \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel\" means that the book could be any other type of novel, not just a mystery novel. Therefore, we can't conclude that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: No",
