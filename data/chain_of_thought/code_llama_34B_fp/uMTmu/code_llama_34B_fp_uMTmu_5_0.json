The statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis\" is a conditional statement, which means that it is possible for Jeff to play basketball without Amy playing tennis. The statement \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis\" means that Amy did not play tennis, but it does not provide any information about Jeff's actions. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: No.",
