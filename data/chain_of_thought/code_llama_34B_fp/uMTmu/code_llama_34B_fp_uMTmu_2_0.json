The statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest\" is a logical consequence of the premise \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" This means that the unicorn may or may not have been in the forest, and we can't draw any conclusions about the griffin's presence in the forest based on this information.\n\nAnswer: No",
