However, it's not the case that Chris must have finished the race (premise 2). This means that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nSince Chris did not finish the race, and the only way for Alex to have finished the race is if Chris finished the race, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
