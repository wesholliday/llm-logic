The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement, which means that it is possible for Lisa to buy the red shirt without Mark buying the blue shirt. The statement \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" means that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. However, this does not mean that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: No",
