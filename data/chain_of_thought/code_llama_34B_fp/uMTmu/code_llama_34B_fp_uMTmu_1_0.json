The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" is a logical consequence of the premise \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This means that the premise is a necessary condition for the conclusion, but it's not a sufficient condition.\n\nIn other words, the premise only rules out one possible scenario, but it doesn't guarantee that Mary was at the wedding. Therefore, we can't draw a conclusion about Mary's presence at the wedding based solely on this information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
