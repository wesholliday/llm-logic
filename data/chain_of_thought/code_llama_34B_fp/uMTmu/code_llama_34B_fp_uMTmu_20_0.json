In this case, the antecedent is \"the apple was red.\"\n\nNext, we can analyze the statement \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\" This statement is also a conditional statement, but it is negated, which means that it is only true if the antecedent is false. In this case, the antecedent is \"the banana must have been yellow.\"\n\nNow, we can use the information we have gathered to determine whether we can infer that the apple was not red. If the antecedent of the first statement is false (i.e., the apple was not red), then the statement is true regardless of the truth value of the consequent (i.e., the banana must have been yellow). Therefore, we cannot infer that the apple was not red based solely on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No.",
