The statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" is a conditional statement, which means that it is possible for the antecedent (Joe going to the park) to be true without the consequent (Lucy going to the zoo) being true. In this case, it is possible for Joe to have gone to the park without Lucy going to the zoo.\n\nAdditionally, the statement \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" means that it is not necessarily true that Lucy went to the zoo. This means that it is possible for Lucy to have not gone to the zoo, regardless of whether or not Joe went to the park.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: No.",
