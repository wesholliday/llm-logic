This means that if Ben did eat pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\n\nSecond, we can assume that the statement \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad\" is also true. This means that Kate did not eat salad.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that Ben did eat pasta. If Ben did eat pasta, then according to the first statement, Kate must have eaten salad. However, we have already established that Kate did not eat salad. This creates a contradiction, which means that our initial assumption that Ben did eat pasta must be false.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, we cannot infer that Ben did not eat pasta.",
