The statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry\" is a conditional statement, which means that it is possible for the cake to be chocolate and the muffins to be blueberry, but it is also possible for the cake to be chocolate and the muffins to be something else.\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry\" means that the muffins are not necessarily blueberry, but it does not provide any information about the cake. Therefore, we can't infer that the cake was not chocolate based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No.",
