However, it does not explicitly state that the zump might be in wobble.\n\nTo infer that the zump might be in wobble, we need to add the word \"might\" before \"be\" in the second part of the sentence. The sentence would then become \"The zump might be zibble quank or might be in wobble.\" This sentence clearly states that the zump might be in wobble.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the zump might be in wobble from the given sentence.",
