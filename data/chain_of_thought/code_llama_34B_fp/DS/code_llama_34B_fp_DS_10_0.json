The missing sock isn't under the bed.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nTo do this, we need to consider the possible scenarios that could be true. Let's call the missing sock \"S\".\n\nScenario 1: S is in the laundry basket.\nScenario 2: S is under the bed.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that either scenario 1 or scenario 2 is true.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that scenario 2 is false, since S is not under the bed.\n\nTherefore, the only possible scenario that can be true is scenario 1, where S is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.",
