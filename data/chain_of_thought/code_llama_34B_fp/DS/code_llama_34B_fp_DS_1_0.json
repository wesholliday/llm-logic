This means that Fido is either in one of these two places, but we don't know which one.\n\nThe second premise states that Fido is not in the garden. This means that Fido is not in the garden, but we don't know where Fido is.\n\nFrom these two premises, we can conclude that Fido is inside. If Fido were in the garden, the second premise would not be true. Therefore, the only possible conclusion is that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
