The premise states that the sunglasses might not be in her bag, which means that there is a possibility that they are not in her bag. However, this does not mean that it is not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag. The conclusion is a negation of the premise, and it is possible for the sunglasses to be in her bag even if there is a possibility that they might not be.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
