If the pen is not in the bag, then it is not the case that the pen must be in the bag. The argument is a correct use of the law of excluded middle, which states that for any proposition P, either P is true or its negation is true. In this case, the proposition is \"the pen is in the bag,\" and its negation is \"the pen is not in the bag.\" If the premise is true, then the conclusion must be true as well.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
