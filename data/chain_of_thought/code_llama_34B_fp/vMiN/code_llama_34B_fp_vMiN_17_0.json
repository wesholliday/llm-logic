The premise states that the scarf might not be stuffed in the backpack, which means it could be somewhere else or not exist at all. The conclusion states that it's not the case that the scarf must be stuffed in the backpack, which means it's possible that the scarf is not in the backpack. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion is a true statement based on the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
