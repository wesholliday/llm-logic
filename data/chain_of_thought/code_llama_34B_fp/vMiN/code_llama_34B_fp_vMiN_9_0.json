The premise states that Lisa might not have bought the red shirt, which means that it is possible that she did not buy it. However, the conclusion states that it is not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt, which means that it is possible that she did not buy it. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion is a true statement, regardless of whether the premise is true or false.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
