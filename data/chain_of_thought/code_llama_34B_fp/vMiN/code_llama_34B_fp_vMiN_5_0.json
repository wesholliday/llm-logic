The premise states that Jeff might not have played basketball, which means that it is possible that he did not play basketball. However, the conclusion states that it is not the case that Jeff must have played basketball, which means that it is possible that he did play basketball. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
