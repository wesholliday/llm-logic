The premise states that the jacket might not be draped over the chair, which means that it is possible that the jacket is not draped over the chair. However, this does not mean that it is necessarily the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair. Therefore, the conclusion that it's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair is a valid conclusion based on the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
