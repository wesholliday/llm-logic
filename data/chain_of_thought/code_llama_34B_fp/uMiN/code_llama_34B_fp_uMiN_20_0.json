If the sunglasses were definitely in her bag, we would not need to consider the possibility that they might not be there. Therefore, the statement \"The sunglasses might not be in her bag\" suggests that there is an open possibility that the sunglasses are not in her bag, which means we cannot infer that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\nAnswer: No.",
