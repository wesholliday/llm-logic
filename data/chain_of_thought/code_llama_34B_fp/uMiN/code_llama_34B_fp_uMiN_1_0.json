If we were certain that Mary was at the wedding, we would not need to consider the possibility that she might not have been there. Therefore, the statement \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" suggests that there is some uncertainty about Mary's attendance at the wedding, which means we cannot infer that it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No.",
