If the notebook must be in the drawer, then the statement would be false, as there would be no possibility that the notebook is not in the drawer. Therefore, the statement \"The notebook might not be in the drawer\" implies that the notebook is not necessarily in the drawer, which means that it's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
