The second premise states that it's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den. Therefore, we can conclude that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nHowever, this conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The first premise only states that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den. It does not state that if the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the bear was not in the cave based solely on the information provided in the premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
