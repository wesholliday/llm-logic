The second premise states that it's not the case that Erin must have taken a train. The conclusion is that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nThe argument is logically invalid because the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The first premise only states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. It does not state what would happen if Sam did not take a plane. Therefore, the conclusion that Sam did not take a plane is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: No.",
