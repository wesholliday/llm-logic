The second premise states that it's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. Therefore, we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nHowever, this conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The first premise only states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. It does not state that Lisa did not buy the red shirt if Mark did not buy the blue shirt. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt based solely on the information provided in the premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
