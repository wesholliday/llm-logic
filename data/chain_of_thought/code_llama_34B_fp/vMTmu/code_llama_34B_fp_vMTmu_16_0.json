The second premise states that it's not the case that the pants must have been denim. The conclusion is that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nThe argument is not valid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The first premise only states that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. It does not state that if the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
