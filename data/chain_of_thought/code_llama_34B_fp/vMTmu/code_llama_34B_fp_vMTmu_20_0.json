The second premise states that it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow. Therefore, we can conclude that the apple was not red.\n\nHowever, this conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The first premise only states that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. It does not state that if the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the apple was not red based solely on the information provided in the premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
