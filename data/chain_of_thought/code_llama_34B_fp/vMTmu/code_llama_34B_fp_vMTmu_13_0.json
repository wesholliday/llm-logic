The second premise states that it's not the case that the truck must have been blue. Therefore, we can conclude that the car was not red.\n\nHowever, this conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The first premise only states that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. It does not state that if the truck was not blue, then the car must not have been red. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the car was not red based solely on the information provided in the premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
