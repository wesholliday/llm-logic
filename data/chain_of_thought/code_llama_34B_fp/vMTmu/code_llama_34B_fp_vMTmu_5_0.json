The second premise states that it's not the case that Amy must have played tennis. The conclusion is that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nThe argument is logically invalid because the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The first premise only states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis, but it does not say anything about what happens if Jeff did not play basketball. Therefore, the conclusion that Jeff did not play basketball is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: No.",
