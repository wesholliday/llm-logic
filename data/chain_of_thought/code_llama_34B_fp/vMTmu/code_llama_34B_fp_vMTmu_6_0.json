The second premise states that it's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta. Therefore, we can conclude that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nHowever, this conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The first premise only states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. It does not state that if Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Sue did not choose pizza based solely on the information provided in the premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
