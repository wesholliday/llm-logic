The second premise states that it's not the case that the cat must have been outside. Therefore, we can conclude that the dog was not inside.\n\nHowever, this argument is based on a false assumption. The first premise assumes that the dog and cat are mutually exclusive, meaning that if the dog is inside, the cat must be outside. But this assumption is not necessarily true. It's possible that both the dog and cat are inside, or that neither of them are inside.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because it relies on a false assumption.\n\nAnswer: No.",
