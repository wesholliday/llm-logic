The second premise states that it's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad. The conclusion is that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nThe argument is logically invalid because the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The first premise only states that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad, but it does not state what would happen if Ben did not eat pasta. Therefore, the conclusion that Ben did not eat pasta cannot be logically deduced from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
