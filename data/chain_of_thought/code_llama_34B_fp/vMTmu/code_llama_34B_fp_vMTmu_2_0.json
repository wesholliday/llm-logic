The second premise states that it's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest. The conclusion is that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nThe argument is logically invalid because the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The first premise only states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest. It does not state that if the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest. Therefore, the conclusion that the griffin was not in the forest is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: No.",
