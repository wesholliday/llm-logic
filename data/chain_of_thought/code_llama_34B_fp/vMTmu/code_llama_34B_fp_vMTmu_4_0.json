The second premise states that it's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter. Therefore, we can conclude that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nHowever, this conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The first premise only states that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter. It does not state that the alien did not visit Mars. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the alien did not visit Mars based solely on the first two premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
