The second premise states that it's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. The conclusion is that Tom did not watch football.\n\nThe argument is logically invalid because the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The first premise only states that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball, but it does not state that if Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football. Therefore, the conclusion is not logically supported by the premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
