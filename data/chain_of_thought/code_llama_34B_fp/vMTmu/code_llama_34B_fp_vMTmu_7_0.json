The second premise states that it's not the case that Chris must have finished the race. Therefore, we can conclude that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nHowever, this conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The first premise only states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race. It does not state that if Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alex did not finish the race based solely on the information provided in the premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
