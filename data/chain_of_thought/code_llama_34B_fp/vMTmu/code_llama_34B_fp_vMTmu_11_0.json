The second premise states that it's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry. The conclusion is that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nThe argument is logically invalid because the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The first premise only states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry. It does not state that if the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake could not have been chocolate. Therefore, the conclusion that the cake was not chocolate is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: No.",
