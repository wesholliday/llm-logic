The second premise, 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', is a conditional statement that implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would also be at the wedding.\n\nSince we know that Mary was not at the wedding, we can conclude that the conditional statement is false. This means that the antecedent (Mary was at the wedding) is false, and the consequent (Sue was at the wedding) is also false. Therefore, we can infer that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
