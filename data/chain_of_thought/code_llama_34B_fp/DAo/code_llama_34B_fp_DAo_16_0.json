The second premise, 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim', states that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants would be denim.\n\nSince the shirt is not cotton, we can conclude that the pants are not denim. This is because if the shirt was cotton, then the pants would be denim, but since the shirt is not cotton, the pants cannot be denim.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
