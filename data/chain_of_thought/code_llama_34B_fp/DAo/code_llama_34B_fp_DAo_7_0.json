This is because the statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" implies that Chris's finishing the race is contingent on Alex's finishing the race. If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris may not have finished the race either.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
