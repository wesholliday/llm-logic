The second premise, 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest', implies that if the griffin is in the forest, the unicorn must also be in the forest.\n\nSince we know that the griffin is not in the forest, we can conclude that the unicorn is not in the forest either, based on the second premise. Therefore, we can infer 'The unicorn was not in the forest'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
