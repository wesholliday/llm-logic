The first premise, \"Sue did not choose pizza,\" tells us that Sue did not select pizza as her food option. The second premise, \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta,\" is a conditional statement that implies that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob would have chosen pasta.\n\nSince we know that Sue did not choose pizza, we can conclude that the conditional statement is false. Therefore, we cannot infer that Bob chose pasta. Therefore, we can infer that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
