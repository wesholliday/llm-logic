The first statement, \"The train might be late,\" implies that the train is not arriving on time, which could be due to various reasons such as traffic, mechanical issues, or other unforeseen circumstances. The second statement, \"The train might be crowded,\" suggests that the train is not empty, which could also be due to various reasons such as a large number of passengers, a popular route, or a holiday.\n\nSince both statements are related and suggest that the train is not running smoothly, we can infer that the train might be late and crowded.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
