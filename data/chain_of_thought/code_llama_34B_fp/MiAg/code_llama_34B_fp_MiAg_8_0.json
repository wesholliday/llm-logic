The first statement, \"The restaurant might be expensive,\" implies that the restaurant is of high quality and therefore, it is likely to be busy. The second statement, \"The restaurant might be busy,\" further supports this inference by suggesting that the restaurant is popular and well-liked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
