If we add the word \"or\" to the statement and include the word \"zizz,\" we are effectively saying that the blimple could be either a gribble or a zizz. However, this does not necessarily mean that the blimple is both a gribble and a zizz. It is possible that the blimple is one or the other, but we do not have enough information to determine which one it is.\n\nAnswer: No.",
