If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\n\nTo infer whether the whiffle was not shanked, we need to analyze the given statements and their logical relationships.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first statement: \"The whiffle did not tink.\" This statement implies that the whiffle did not make any sound, which means it was not tinked.\n\nNow, let's move on to the second statement: \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\" This statement implies that if the whiffle was shanked, it would have tinked. However, since the whiffle did not tink, we can infer that it was not shanked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can conclude that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
