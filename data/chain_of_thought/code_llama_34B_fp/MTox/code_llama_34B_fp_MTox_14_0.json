If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\n\nTo infer whether the clug was not fleeked, we need to analyze the given statements and their implications.\n\nStatement 1 implies that the clug did not snug together, which means it did not form a cohesive unit. This does not necessarily imply that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nStatement 2 is a conditional statement, which means that if the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged. However, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true, which means that if the clug snugged, it does not necessarily imply that the clug was fleeked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: No.",
