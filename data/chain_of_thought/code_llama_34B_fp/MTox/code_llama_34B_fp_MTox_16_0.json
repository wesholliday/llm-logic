If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\n\nTo infer whether the sneg was not crampled, we need to analyze the given statements and their implications.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first statement: \"The sneg did not sprot the frink.\" This statement implies that the sneg did not successfully sprot the frink, but it does not provide any information about the sneg's state of being crampled or not.\n\nNow, let's move on to the second statement: \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\" This statement implies that if the sneg was crampled, it would have sproted the frink. However, the statement does not mention what would happen if the sneg was not crampled.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot infer that the sneg was not crampled. The first statement does not provide any information about the sneg's state of being crampled, and the second statement only implies that if the sneg was crampled, it would have sproted the frink. Therefore, we cannot draw a conclusion about the sneg's state of being crampled.\n\nAnswer: No.",
