If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\n\nTo infer \"The dreb was not vroombed,\" we need to show that the negation of the second statement is true. The negation of the second statement is \"The dreb was not vroombed or the dreb was not spened.\"\n\nWe can see that the first statement \"The dreb was not spened\" is true, and the second statement \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\" is false. Therefore, the negation of the second statement \"The dreb was not vroombed or the dreb was not spened\" is also true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
