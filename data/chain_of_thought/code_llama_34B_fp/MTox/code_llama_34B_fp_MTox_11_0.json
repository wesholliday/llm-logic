If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\n\nTo infer 'The flug was not blummed', we need to use the principle of non-contradiction. This principle states that a statement cannot both be true and false at the same time.\n\nIn this case, if we assume that the flug was blummed, then according to the second statement, the flug was zimmed. However, this contradicts the first statement, which states that the flug was not zimmed. Therefore, we cannot infer that the flug was blummed.\n\nAnswer: No.",
