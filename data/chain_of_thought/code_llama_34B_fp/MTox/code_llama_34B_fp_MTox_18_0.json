This means that the shank was not joined or connected with anything else.\n\nThe second premise states that if the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged. This means that if the shank was plooked, it would have been joined or connected with something else, which is not the case since the first premise states that the shank was not nugged.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the shank was not plooked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
