If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that the zinger was not fraggled. This is because if the zinger was fraggled, then it would have been smoogled according to the second statement. However, we are given that the zinger was not smoogled, which means it cannot have been fraggled. Therefore, the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
