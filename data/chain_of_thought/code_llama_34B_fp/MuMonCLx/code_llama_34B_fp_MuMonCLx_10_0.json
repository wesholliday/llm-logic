However, this does not necessarily mean that the snork must be froodle. It is possible for the snork to be froodle and glorp without being froodle.\n\nFor example, if we have a snork that is both froodle and glorp, it is possible that the snork is froodle because it has the characteristics of froodle, but it is also glorp because it has the characteristics of glorp. In this case, we cannot infer that the snork must be froodle based solely on the fact that it is both froodle and glorp.\n\nAnswer: No.",
