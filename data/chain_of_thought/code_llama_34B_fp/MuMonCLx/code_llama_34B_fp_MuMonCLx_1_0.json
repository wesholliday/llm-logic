The words \"quimble,\" \"snorkel,\" \"flonk,\" and \"zump\" are not commonly used words in the English language, and it is not clear what they are supposed to refer to.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The quimble must be snorkel\" because the original statement is not a meaningful or coherent statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
