            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This statement is in the form of a conditional, where the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is \"the doll was plastic\" and the consequent (the \"then\" part) is \"the truck was metal.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic,\" we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. In particular, we need to determine whether the negation of the consequent (i.e., \"the truck was not metal\") logically implies the negation of the antecedent (i.e., \"the doll was not plastic\").\n\nIn this case, we can see that the negation of the consequent (\"the truck was not metal\") does not logically imply the negation of the antecedent (\"the doll was not plastic\"). For example, it is possible for the doll to be plastic even if the truck is not metal. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
