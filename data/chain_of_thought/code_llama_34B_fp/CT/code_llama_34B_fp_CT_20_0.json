It implies that the color of the apple is related to the color of the banana. However, it does not explicitly state that the color of the apple determines the color of the banana.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red\" from the given statement. The statement only implies a correlation between the colors of the apple and the banana, but it does not establish a causal relationship between them.\n\nAnswer: No.",
