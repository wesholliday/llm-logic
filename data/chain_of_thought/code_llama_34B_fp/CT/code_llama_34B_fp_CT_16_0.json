If the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim. However, it does not imply that if the pants are not denim, then the shirt is not cotton.\n\nFor example, it is possible that the person wearing the shirt and pants could have chosen to wear a cotton shirt with denim pants, but it is also possible that they could have chosen to wear a cotton shirt with non-denim pants. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: No.",
