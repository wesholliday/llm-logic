However, it does not imply that if Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\n\nTo infer that \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park,\" we would need additional information or evidence that establishes a causal relationship between Lucy's actions and Joe's actions. Without this additional information, we cannot infer that Joe did not go to the park based solely on the fact that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: No.",
