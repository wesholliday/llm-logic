            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den'. This statement is in the form of a conditional, specifically a material implication. The material implication can be represented as a logical expression:\n\n(Bear \u2208 Cave) \u2192 (Wolf \u2208 Den)\n\nwhere Bear \u2208 Cave and Wolf \u2208 Den represent the propositions that the bear is in the cave and the wolf is in the den, respectively.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave', we need to check if the converse of the given statement is logically valid. The converse of the statement is:\n\nIf the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\n\nThis converse can be represented as a logical expression:\n\n(Wolf \u2209 Den) \u2192 (Bear \u2209 Cave)\n\nTo determine if the converse is logically valid, we need to check if it is a tautology. A tautology is a statement that is always true, regardless of the values of its propositions.\n\nUnfortunately, the converse is not a tautology. It is possible for the wolf to be in the den and the bear to be in the cave, which would make the converse false. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
