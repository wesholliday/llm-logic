            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" implies that there is a causal relationship between the color of the car and the color of the truck. Specifically, if the car is red, then the truck is blue. However, this statement does not imply that the truck being blue is the only possible outcome when the car is red. There could be other factors at play that affect the color of the truck.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\" from the given statement. The statement only implies that if the car is red, then the truck is blue, but it does not provide any information about what happens when the truck is not blue.\n\nAnswer: No.",
