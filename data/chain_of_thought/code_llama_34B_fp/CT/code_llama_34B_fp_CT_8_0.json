It implies that the vampire's state of being awake causes the mummy to also be awake. However, it does not imply that the mummy's state of being awake causes the vampire to be awake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\" This is because the causal relationship between the vampire and the mummy only goes in one direction, from the vampire to the mummy.\n\nAnswer: No.",
