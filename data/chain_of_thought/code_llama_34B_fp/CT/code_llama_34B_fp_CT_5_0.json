However, it does not imply that if Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nTo infer that if Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball, we would need additional information or evidence. For example, if we knew that Jeff and Amy are identical twins, and that one of them playing basketball would necessarily mean the other played tennis, then we could infer that if Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nHowever, without this additional information, we cannot infer that if Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: No.",
