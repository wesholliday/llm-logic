            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This statement implies a causal relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball. However, it does not imply that if Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\n\nTo infer that if Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football, we would need additional information or a stronger causal relationship between the two activities. For example, if we knew that Tom and Jen always watched football and basketball together, then we could infer that if Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football. However, with the given information, we cannot make this inference.\n\nAnswer: No.",
