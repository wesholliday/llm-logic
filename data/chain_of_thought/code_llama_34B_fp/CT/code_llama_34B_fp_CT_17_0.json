This statement implies a causal relationship between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating the salad. However, it does not imply that Kate eating the salad is the cause of Ben eating pasta.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta', we need to consider the possibility of other factors that may have caused both Ben and Kate to eat their respective meals. For example, if both Ben and Kate were hungry and chose to eat the same meal, then it is possible that Kate did not eat the salad even if Ben did eat pasta.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
