This statement is in the form of a conditional, specifically a material conditional. The material conditional indicates that if the antecedent (the 'if' part) is true, then the consequent (the 'then' part) must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the antecedent is 'the book was written by James', and the consequent is 'the book is a mystery novel'. If we assume that the book was indeed written by James, then we can infer that it is a mystery novel.\n\nHowever, the reverse is not necessarily true. Just because the book is not a mystery novel does not mean that it was not written by James. There are other genres of books that James could have written, and we cannot infer that he did not write the book based solely on its genre.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
