            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This statement is in the form of a conditional, specifically a material conditional. The material conditional states that if a certain condition is met, then a certain outcome will occur. In this case, the condition is \"the griffin was in the forest,\" and the outcome is \"the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest,\" we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. The first statement is a material conditional, and the second statement is also a material conditional.\n\nIn order to infer the second statement from the first, we need to determine whether the first statement implies the second statement. To do this, we can use a technique called \"modus ponens.\" Modus ponens is a logical rule that allows us to deduce a conclusion from a premise and a conditional statement.\n\nIn this case, the premise is \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" The conditional statement is \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\" We can use modus ponens to deduce the conclusion that \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\" from \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
