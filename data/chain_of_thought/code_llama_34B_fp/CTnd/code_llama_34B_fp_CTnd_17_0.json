In other words, if a customer is greeted, it is likely that they were not greeted warmly.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer \"If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted\" from this statement. This is because the statement only implies a negative correlation between being greeted and being greeted warmly, and does not provide any information about the relationship between being greeted warmly and being greeted.\n\nAnswer: No.",
