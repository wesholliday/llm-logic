The principle of contraposition states that if a statement of the form \"If A, then B\" is true, then the statement of the form \"If not B, then not A\" is also true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the job was completed well, then it was not completed\" from the given statement, because the statement \"If the job was completed, then it was not completed well\" is a negation of the statement \"If the job was completed well, then it was completed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
