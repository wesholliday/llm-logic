In other words, if a customer is served, it is likely that they were not served promptly.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer \"If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served\" from the given statement. This is because the statement only implies that if a customer is served, they were not served promptly, but it does not imply that if a customer was served promptly, they were not served.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no, we cannot infer \"If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served\" from \"If the customer was served, then he was not served promptly\".",
