This means that the room was cleaned, but there may be some dirt or mess left in the room.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned\" implies that the room was cleaned thoroughly, which means that it was cleaned to a high standard and there is no dirt or mess left in the room.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned\" from \"If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
