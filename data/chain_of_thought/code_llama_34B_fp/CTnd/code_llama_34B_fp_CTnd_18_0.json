In other words, if the issue was discussed, it is likely that it was not discussed in depth. However, this does not mean that if the issue was discussed in depth, it was not discussed at all.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
