This means that the clothes were not washed properly.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer \"If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed\" from the given statement. The statement only implies that the clothes were washed, but it does not provide any information about whether they were washed properly or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that if the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed.\n\nAnswer: No.",
