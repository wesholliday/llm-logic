This means that there may be some mess or disorganization in the room.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied\" implies that the room was tidied thoroughly, which means that it is completely clean and organized.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied\" from \"If the room was tidied, then it was not tidied thoroughly\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
