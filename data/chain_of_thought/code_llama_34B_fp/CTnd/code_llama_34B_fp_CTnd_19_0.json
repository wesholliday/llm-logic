It states that if directions were provided, then they were not explained clearly. This means that if directions were provided, it is likely that they were not explained clearly.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer that if directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided. This is because there is no logical connection between the two statements. It is possible that directions were provided and were also explained clearly.\n\nAnswer: No.",
