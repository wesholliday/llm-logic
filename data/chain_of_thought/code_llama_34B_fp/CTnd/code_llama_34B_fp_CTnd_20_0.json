In other words, if a recommendation was made, it is likely that the recommendation was not strong.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer from this statement that \"If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made.\" This is because the statement only provides information about the strength of the recommendation, not whether a recommendation was made at all. It is possible that a strong recommendation was made, but we cannot infer this from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
