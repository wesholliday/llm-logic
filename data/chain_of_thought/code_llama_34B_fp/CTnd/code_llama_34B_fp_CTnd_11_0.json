It expresses a cause-and-effect relationship between going to the store and not buying vegetables. The statement does not imply that going to the store is the only way to buy vegetables, or that not buying vegetables means that I did not go to the store.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store\" from the given statement. The two statements are not logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: No.",
