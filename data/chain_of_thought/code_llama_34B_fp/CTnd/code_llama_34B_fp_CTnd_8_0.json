This means that the issue was not fully resolved or the solution was not satisfactory.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed\" implies that the issue was not addressed at all. This means that the issue was not dealt with or resolved.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed\" from \"If the issue was addressed, then it was not addressed effectively\". The two statements are not logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: No.",
