The negation of \"Ate a meal\" is \"Did not eat a meal\", and the negation of \"Did not eat a large meal\" is \"Ate a large meal\".\n\nTherefore, the inferred statement is \"Did not eat a large meal \u2227 Ate a meal\", which is logically equivalent to \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
