This is because the statement \"If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice\" implies that there was advice offered, but it was not helpful. Therefore, if helpful advice was offered, it would mean that there was advice offered, and it was helpful, which contradicts the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
