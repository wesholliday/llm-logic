This means that the instructions were not adequately explained, which is the opposite of being explained clearly.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given\" from the given statement. The correct inference would be \"If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were given.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
