It suggests that if Ben studied, he did not study diligently.\n\nTo infer \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study,\" we would need to reverse the conditional. However, reversing the conditional would result in a different statement, \"If Ben did not study diligently, then he studied.\" This statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement, and we cannot infer \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
