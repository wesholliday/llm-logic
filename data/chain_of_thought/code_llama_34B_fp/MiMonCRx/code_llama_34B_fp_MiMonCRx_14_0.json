The phrase \"might be blimped and zazzled\" suggests that the grazzle is in a state of being blimped and zazzled, which implies that it is in a state of being both blimped and zazzled. Since zazzled is a word that is derived from the word \"zazzle,\" it is likely that the grazzle is in a state of being zazzled as well.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
