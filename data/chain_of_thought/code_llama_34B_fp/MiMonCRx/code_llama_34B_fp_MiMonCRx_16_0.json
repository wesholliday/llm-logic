This word implies that there is a possibility or a chance that the snorkel is flumped. Additionally, the word \"zibbed\" is not a commonly used word, and it is not clear what it means. Therefore, it is possible that the sentence is using \"zibbed\" as a placeholder or a filler word, and the main point of the sentence is that the snorkel might be flumped.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
