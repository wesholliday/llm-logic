            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis is a classic example of a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that uses a set of premises to reach a conclusion. The first premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. The second premise states that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest, we need to consider the logical relationship between the premises. In this case, the first premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true. The second premise is a negative statement, which means that it is only true if the thing being described (the unicorn) is not in the forest.\n\nBased on these premises, we can conclude that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn would also be in the forest. However, since we know that the unicorn is not in the forest, we can infer that the griffin is not in the forest either.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
