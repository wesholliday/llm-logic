This means that if the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) is true, then the consequent (Amy played tennis) must also be true. However, since we know that Amy did not play tennis, we can conclude that the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) must be false. Therefore, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
