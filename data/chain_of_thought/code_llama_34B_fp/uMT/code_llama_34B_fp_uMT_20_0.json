This means that if the antecedent (the first part of the statement) is true, then the consequent (the second part of the statement) must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the antecedent is \"the apple was red,\" and the consequent is \"the banana was yellow.\" If the apple was red, then the banana must be yellow.\n\nHowever, we also know that the banana was not yellow. This means that the antecedent (the apple being red) must be false, because the consequent (the banana being yellow) is false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
