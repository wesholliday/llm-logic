            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis is a classic example of a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that uses a set of premises to reach a conclusion. The first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. The second premise states that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding, we need to evaluate the strength of the premises and the conclusion. The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is not necessarily true. However, the second premise is a negative statement, which means that it is a strong statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
