It's a disjunctive statement, meaning it presents two alternatives, but it does not exclude the possibility that the floob is actually both zibber zizz and bimboozle. Therefore, we cannot infer that the floob must be bimboozle, as the statement does not rule out the possibility that the floob is zibber zizz.\n\nAnswer: no"
