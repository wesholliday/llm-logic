In this case, the condition is that the glip was slogged.\n\nThe statement \"If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged\" is also a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that is true only if a certain condition is met. In this case, the condition is that the glip was not tragged.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer the second statement from the first statement, we need to look at the conditions that are implied by each statement.\n\nThe first statement implies that if the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged. This means that if the glip was slogged, then it was also tragged.\n\nThe second statement implies that if the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged. This means that if the glip was not tragged, then it was not slogged.\n\nNow, we can compare the two statements and see if they are logically equivalent. If the first statement implies that the glip was tragged if it was slogged, and the second statement implies that the glip was not slogged if it was not tragged, then we can infer that the glip was not slogged if it was not tragged.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the second statement from the first statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
