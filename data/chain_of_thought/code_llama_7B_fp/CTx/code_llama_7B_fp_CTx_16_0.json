However, this does not necessarily mean that the opposite of the conclusion (the sneg did not sprot the frink) implies the opposite of the premise (the sneg was not crampled).\n\nFor example, if the sneg was crampled and it did not sprot the frink, then the statement is still true, even though the premise and conclusion are opposite. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the sneg did not sprot the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: No.",
