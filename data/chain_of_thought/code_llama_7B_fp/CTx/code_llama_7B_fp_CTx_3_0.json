            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" implies that the splat quanked only if it was morphed. This means that the splat quanked is a necessary condition for the splat to be morphed.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed\". This statement asserts that the splat was not morphed only if it did not quank. This means that the splat was not morphed is a necessary condition for the splat not to quank.\n\nWe can infer that \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed\" is logically equivalent to \"If the splat quanked, then the splat was morphed\". This is because the first statement asserts that the splat was not morphed only if it did not quank, while the second statement asserts that the splat was morphed only if it quanked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed\" is logically equivalent to \"If the splat quanked, then the splat was morphed\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
