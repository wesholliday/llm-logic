In this case, the condition is that the shank was plooked.\n\nThe statement \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked\" is also a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that is true only if a certain condition is met. In this case, the condition is that the shank was not nugged.\n\nIf we assume that the shank was plooked, then we can infer that the shank was nugged, because the first statement is true. However, if we assume that the shank was not nugged, then we cannot infer that the shank was not plooked, because the second statement is not true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked\" from \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
