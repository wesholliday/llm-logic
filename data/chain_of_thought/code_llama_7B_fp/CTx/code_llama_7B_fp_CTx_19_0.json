The premises are the given statements, and the conclusion is the statement that we want to draw.\n\nIn this case, the premises are:\n\n1. If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\n2. The smonk did not plagged.\n\nTo draw the conclusion, we need to use the first premise to infer the second premise. We can do this by using the following reasoning:\n\n1. If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\n2. The smonk was not vreebled.\n3. Therefore, the smonk did not plagged.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can draw is:\n\nIf the smonk did not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
