In this case, the condition is that the fribble was snurgled, and the outcome is that the fribble crinked.\n\nTo infer the second statement, we need to analyze the structure of the conditional statement. We can do this by breaking it down into its constituent parts:\n\n* The condition: \"If the fribble was snurgled\"\n* The outcome: \"then the fribble crinked\"\n\nNow, we can see that the second statement is a negation of the first statement. In other words, if the fribble was not snurgled, then it did not crink.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is yes. We can infer the second statement from the first statement.",
