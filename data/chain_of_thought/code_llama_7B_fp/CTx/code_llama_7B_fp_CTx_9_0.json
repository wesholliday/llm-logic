In this case, the condition is that the twonk was plinked.\n\nThe statement \"If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked\" is also a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that is true only if a certain condition is met. In this case, the condition is that the twonk was not varnished.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer the second statement from the first statement, we need to look at the conditions that are implied by each statement.\n\nThe first statement implies that if the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished. This means that if the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished, and therefore, if the twonk was not varnished, then it was not plinked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the second statement from the first statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
