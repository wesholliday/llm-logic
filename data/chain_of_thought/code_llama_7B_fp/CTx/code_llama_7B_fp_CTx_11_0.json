The premises are the statements that are known to be true, and the conclusion is the statement that is inferred to be true based on the premises.\n\nIn this case, the premises are:\n\n1. If the flight was blummed, then the flight was zimmed.\n2. The flight was not zimmed.\n\nThe conclusion that can be inferred from these premises is:\n\n3. If the flight was not zimmed, then the flight was not blummed.\n\nThis conclusion is logically valid, as it follows from the premises and is not contradictory to them. Therefore, we can infer the conclusion from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
