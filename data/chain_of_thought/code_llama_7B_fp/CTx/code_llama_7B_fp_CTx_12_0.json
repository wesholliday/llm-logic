In this case, the condition is that the smip was shripped.\n\nThe statement \"If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped\" is also a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that is true only if certain conditions are met. In this case, the condition is that the smip did not lup the zoint.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer the second statement from the first statement, we need to look at the conditions that are implied by each statement.\n\nThe first statement implies that if the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint. This means that if the smip was shripped, then it is possible that the smip lupped the zoint.\n\nThe second statement implies that if the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped. This means that if the smip did not lup the zoint, then it is not possible that the smip was shripped.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the second statement from the first statement, because the first statement implies that the smip was shripped, and the second statement implies that the smip was not shripped.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
