However, this does not necessarily mean that the opposite of the conclusion (the wug was not garpled) implies the opposite of the premise (the wug was not sproonged).\n\nFor example, if the wug was sproonged and it was not garpled, then the statement would still be true, even though the opposite of the conclusion (the wug was not garpled) is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproonged. We can only infer that if the wug was sproonged, then it was garpled.",
