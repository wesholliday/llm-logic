            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a complex sentence that contains a conditional statement. The conditional statement is \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\" To infer the opposite of this conditional statement, we need to analyze the sentence carefully.\n\nFirstly, we need to identify the main clause and the dependent clause. The main clause is \"If the grommet was sploffed,\" and the dependent clause is \"then the grommet plopped the frink.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the meaning of the conditional statement. If the grommet was sploffed, it means that the grommet was subjected to a force that caused it to move or change its position. In this case, the grommet plopped the frink, which means that the grommet moved the frink to a new position.\n\nTherefore, the conditional statement \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" means that if the grommet was moved or changed its position, it would have plopped the frink.\n\nNow, let's infer the opposite of this conditional statement. If the grommet did not plop the frink, it means that the grommet did not move or change its position. In this case, it is not possible that the grommet was sploffed, because if the grommet was sploffed, it would have plopped the frink.\n\nTherefore, the opposite of the conditional statement \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" is \"If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
