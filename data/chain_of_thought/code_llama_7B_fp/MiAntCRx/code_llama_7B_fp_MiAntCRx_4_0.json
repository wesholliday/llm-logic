This statement is in the form of a conditional sentence, where 'The zizz might be' is the condition and 'quibble' is the consequence. The word 'might' indicates a possibility, not a certainty. The statement does not provide any information about 'blurble'. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The zizz might be blurble and quibble' because there is no connection or information about 'blurble' in the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
