            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The team might win or lose the match' is a classic example of a disjunctive statement, which means it expresses a possibility of two or more mutually exclusive outcomes. In this case, the outcomes are 'win' and 'lose'. The word 'or' is used to indicate that the team might achieve either one of these outcomes, but not both at the same time. This is a fundamental property of disjunctive statements, which implies that the possibilities are mutually exclusive. Therefore, we can infer that the team might win the match and the team might lose the match, but it cannot do both at the same time.\n\nAnswer: yes"
