Sam did not take a plane.\n\nFrom the first two statements, we can infer that Sam and Erin took different modes of transportation.\n\nNow, let's consider the third statement:\n\n3. Sam did not take a plane.\n\nThis statement contradicts the first statement, which implies that Sam took a plane. Therefore, we can conclude that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nNow, let's return to the second statement:\n\n2. Erin took a train.\n\nThis statement is still valid, even though Sam did not take a plane. Therefore, we can conclude that Erin took a train.\n\nFinally, let's consider the question: Can we infer that Erin did not take a train?\n\nThe answer is no. We cannot infer that Erin did not take a train based on the information provided. The information only tells us that Erin took a train, and does not provide any information about whether or not she took a train.",
