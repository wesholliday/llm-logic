Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nWe need to determine whether we can infer that Kate did not eat salad.\n\nTo do this, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements. The first statement implies that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. This means that if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad.\n\nHowever, we are also given the information that Ben did not eat pasta. This means that Ben did not eat pasta, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that Kate did not eat salad.\n\nAnswer: No.",
