Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nFrom the first two statements, we can infer that Mark bought the blue shirt. This is because if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nHowever, the third statement contradicts this inference. If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then it is possible that she bought the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
