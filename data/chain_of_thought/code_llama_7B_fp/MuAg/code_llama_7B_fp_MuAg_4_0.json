            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a conjunction of two independent clauses, \"The meeting must be at 2 PM\" and \"The meeting must be in the conference room\". The word \"and\" is used to connect these two clauses, indicating that both conditions must be met. The order of the clauses is not changed, and no additional words are added or removed. Therefore, the inference is that both conditions must be met simultaneously, resulting in the same meaning as the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
