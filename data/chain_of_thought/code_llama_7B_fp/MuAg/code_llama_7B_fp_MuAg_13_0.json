            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a conjunction of two conditions: \"The movie must have been in English\" and \"it must have had subtitles\". The word \"it\" in the second condition refers back to \"the movie\", which is the subject of the first condition. This means that the two conditions are describing the same thing, the movie. Therefore, we can infer that the movie must have been in English and had subtitles, because the two conditions are logically connected.\n\nAnswer: yes"
