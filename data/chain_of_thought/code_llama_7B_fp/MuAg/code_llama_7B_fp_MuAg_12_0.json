            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a conjunction of two independent clauses, \"The project must have been completed by Friday\" and \"it must have been under budget\". The word \"and\" is used to connect these two clauses, indicating that both conditions must be met. The phrase \"it must have been under budget\" is a pronoun reference to \"the project\", making it clear that the project itself must have been under budget, not just the cost of completing it. Therefore, the inference is that the project must have been completed by Friday and been under budget.\n\nAnswer: yes"
