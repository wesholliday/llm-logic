The original statement is a conjunction of two conditions: \"The software must have been updated\" and \"it must have been restarted\". The conclusion is also a conjunction of the same two conditions. In a syllogism, if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, we can logically infer that if the software must have been updated and it must have been restarted, then indeed the software must have been updated and restarted.\n\nAnswer: yes"
