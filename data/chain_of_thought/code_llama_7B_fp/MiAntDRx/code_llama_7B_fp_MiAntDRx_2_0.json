The phrase \"The quibble might be on the quibble or in the fizzle\" suggests that the quibble (a minor complaint or criticism) could either be directed at the quibble itself or at the fizzle (a sudden loss of energy or excitement). The phrase is structured as a conditional statement, implying that there are two possible locations for the quibble. \n\nGiven this structure, it is reasonable to infer that the quibble might indeed be in the fizzle, as it is one of the two possible locations mentioned in the original statement. \n\nAnswer: yes"
