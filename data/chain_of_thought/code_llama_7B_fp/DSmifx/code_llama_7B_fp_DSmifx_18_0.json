The shank might not be nugged.\n\nTo infer the third statement, \"The shank is plooked,\" we need to consider the possible combinations of the given statements.\n\nIf the shank must be nugged, then it cannot be plooked. Therefore, the third statement cannot be inferred from the given statements.\n\nIf the shank might not be nugged, then it could be either nugged or plooked. In this case, we cannot infer the third statement.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no.",
