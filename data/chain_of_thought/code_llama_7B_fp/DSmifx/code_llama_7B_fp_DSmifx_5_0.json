The zinger might not be smoogled.\n\nTo infer the third statement, \"The zinger is fraggled,\" we need to consider the possible combinations of the given statements.\n\nIf the zinger must be smoogled, then it is fraggled. This is because the first statement implies that the zinger must be smoogled, and the second statement does not contradict this. Therefore, we can infer that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nOn the other hand, if the zinger might not be smoogled, then it is possible that it is fraggled. However, this does not necessarily mean that the zinger is fraggled, as the second statement only provides a possibility that the zinger might not be smoogled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the zinger is fraggled if the first statement is true, but we cannot infer it if the second statement is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
