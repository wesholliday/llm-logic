In this case, the conclusion \"The sprocket is cranked\" follows logically from the premises.\n\nOn the other hand, if the sprocket might not be daggled, then it is possible that it is not cranked, even if it is daggled. In this case, the conclusion \"The sprocket is cranked\" does not follow logically from the premises.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the conclusion \"The sprocket is cranked\" from the premises \"Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked\" and \"The sprocket might not be daggled.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
