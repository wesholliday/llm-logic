Therefore, the first statement implies that the flob is not skizzled.\n\nOn the other hand, if the flob is not movated, then it is either skizzled or not movated. The second statement does not provide any information about the flob's skizzled status.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The flob is skizzled\" from these two statements alone. We need additional information to determine the flob's skizzled status.\n\nAnswer: No.",
