The wug might not be bimmed.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The wug is flooped,\" we need to consider the possible combinations of the given statements.\n\nIf the wug is bimmed, then it is flooped. Therefore, the first statement implies that the wug is flooped if it is bimmed.\n\nHowever, if the wug is not bimmed, then it is not flooped. Therefore, the second statement implies that the wug is not flooped if it is not bimmed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the wug is flooped if it is bimmed, and it is not flooped if it is not bimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
