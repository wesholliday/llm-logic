In this case, we can infer that the sneg is crampled.\n\nHowever, if the sneg might not be sproted, then it is possible that it is not crampled. In this case, we cannot infer that the sneg is crampled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The sneg is crampled\" from \"Either the sneg must be sproted or it is crampled\" together with \"The sneg might not be sproted\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
