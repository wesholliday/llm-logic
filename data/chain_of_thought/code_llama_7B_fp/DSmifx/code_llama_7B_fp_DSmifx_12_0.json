The smip might not be lupped.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The smip is shripped,\" we need to consider the possible combinations of the given statements.\n\nIf the smip is lupped, then it is not shripped. Therefore, the first statement implies that the smip is shripped.\n\nOn the other hand, if the smip is not lupped, then it is not shripped. Therefore, the second statement implies that the smip is shripped.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
