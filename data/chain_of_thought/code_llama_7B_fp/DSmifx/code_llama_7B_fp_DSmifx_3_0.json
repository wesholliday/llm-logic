The splat might not be quanked.\n\nTo infer the third statement, \"The splat is morphed,\" we need to consider the possible combinations of the given statements.\n\nIf the splat is quanked, then it is not morphed, as the first statement states that the splat must be quanked or it is morphed. Therefore, if the splat is quanked, we cannot infer that it is morphed.\n\nOn the other hand, if the splat is not quanked, then it is possible that it is morphed, as the second statement states that the splat might not be quanked. However, we cannot infer that the splat is morphed based solely on the second statement, as it does not provide any information about the splat's morphed status.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the third statement, \"The splat is morphed,\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No.",
