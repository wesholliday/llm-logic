The fleeg might not be surned.\n\nTo infer the third statement, \"The fleeg is bluttered,\" we need to consider the possible combinations of the given statements.\n\nIf the fleeg is surned, then it is not bluttered. Therefore, the first statement implies that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nOn the other hand, if the fleeg is not surned, then it might not be bluttered. However, the second statement does not provide any information about the fleeg's bluttering status.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the third statement based on the given statements alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
