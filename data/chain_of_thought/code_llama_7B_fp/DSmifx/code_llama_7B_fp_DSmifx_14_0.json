Either the clug must be snugged or it is fleeked.\n2. The clug might not be snugged.\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer that if the clug is not snugged, then it must be fleeked. However, we cannot infer that the clug is fleeked based on the first premise alone, as it does not rule out the possibility that the clug is snugged.\n\nAnswer: No.",
