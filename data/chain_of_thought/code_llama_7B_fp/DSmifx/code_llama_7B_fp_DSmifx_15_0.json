The dreb might not be spent.\n\nTo infer the third statement, \"The dreb is vroombed,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given statements.\n\nFirst, we need to consider the first statement. It states that either the dreb must be spent or it is vroombed. This means that if the dreb is not spent, it must be vroombed.\n\nNext, we need to consider the second statement. It states that the dreb might not be spent. This means that the dreb might be vroombed, but it might also be spent.\n\nNow, we need to use the first statement to infer the third statement. If the dreb is not spent, it must be vroombed. Therefore, we can infer that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
