Therefore, the first statement implies that the flug is not blummed.\n\nOn the other hand, if the flug might not be zimmed, then it could be blummed. However, this does not necessarily mean that the flug is blummed, as it could also be zimmed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the flug is blummed based solely on the given statements. We need more information to make a definitive conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No.",
