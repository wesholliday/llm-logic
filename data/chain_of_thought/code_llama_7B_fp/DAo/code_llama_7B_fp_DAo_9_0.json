            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given two statements:\n\n1. Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n2. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nWe need to determine whether we can infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nTo do this, we need to consider the truth table for the conditional statement:\n\nIf Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\n| Lisa bought red shirt | Mark bought blue shirt |\n| --- | --- |\n| No | Yes |\n| Yes | Yes |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This means that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then we can infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nHowever, if Lisa did buy the red shirt, then we cannot infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This is because the conditional statement only states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. It does not say that Mark did not buy the blue shirt if Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt if Lisa did not buy the red shirt. However, if Lisa did buy the red shirt, then we cannot infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
