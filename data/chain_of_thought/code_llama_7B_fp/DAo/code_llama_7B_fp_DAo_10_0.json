If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n\nTo infer \"The cat was not outside,\" we need to use logical reasoning to draw a conclusion from the given premises.\n\nFirst, we need to consider the first premise, \"The dog was not inside.\" This premise tells us that the dog was not in the room where the cat was.\n\nNext, we need to consider the second premise, \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This premise tells us that if the dog was inside the room, then the cat was outside the room.\n\nNow, we need to use the first premise to infer that the dog was not inside the room. This means that the dog was not in the room where the cat was.\n\nFinally, we need to use the second premise to infer that if the dog was inside the room, then the cat was outside the room. Since the dog was not inside the room, this means that the cat was not outside the room.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The cat was not outside.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
