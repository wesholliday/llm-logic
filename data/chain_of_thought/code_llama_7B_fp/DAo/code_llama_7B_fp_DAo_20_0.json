If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The banana was not yellow,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we need to consider the first premise, \"The apple was not red.\" This premise states that the apple is not red, which means it could be any color other than red.\n\nNext, we need to consider the second premise, \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This premise states that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow.\n\nNow, we can use the first premise to infer that the apple is not red. If the apple is not red, then it could be any color other than red.\n\nUsing the second premise, we can infer that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow. However, we have already established that the apple is not red, so this premise does not apply in this case.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the banana was not yellow.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
