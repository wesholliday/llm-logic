However, we are not told what Sue did choose.\n\nIf we assume that \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta,\" then we know that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. However, we are not told whether Sue chose pizza or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"Bob did not choose pasta\" based on these two statements alone. We need more information to make a conclusion about Bob's choice.",
