The first statement, \"The car was not red,\" implies that the car is not red, which means that the truck, which is connected to the car through the phrase \"If the car was red,\" must also not be red. This means that the truck must be blue, as stated in the second statement. Therefore, we can infer that the truck was not blue.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
