            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given two statements:\n\n1. Tom did not watch football.\n2. If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n\nWe need to determine whether we can infer that Jen did not watch basketball based on these two statements.\n\nTo do this, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. The first statement states that Tom did not watch football, while the second statement states that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n\nIf we assume that Tom did not watch football, then we can infer that Jen did not watch basketball, because the second statement implies that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. However, we know that Tom did not watch football, so we can conclude that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Jen did not watch basketball based on the two statements given.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
