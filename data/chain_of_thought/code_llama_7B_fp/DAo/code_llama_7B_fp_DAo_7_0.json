If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nWe need to determine whether we can infer that Chris did not finish the race based on these two statements.\n\nTo do this, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. The first statement states that Alex did not finish the race, while the second statement states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nIf we assume that Alex did not finish the race, then we can infer that Chris did not finish the race, because the second statement states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. However, if we assume that Alex did finish the race, then we cannot infer that Chris did not finish the race, because the second statement only states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Chris did not finish the race based on the two statements given.\n\nAnswer: No.",
