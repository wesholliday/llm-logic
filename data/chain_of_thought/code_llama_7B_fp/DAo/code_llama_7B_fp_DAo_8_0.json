If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The mummy was not awake,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the vampire was awake by using the first premise. If the vampire was not awake, then it is possible that the mummy was not awake.\n\nSecond, we can use the second premise to infer that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This means that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the mummy was not awake, based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
