The statement \"Mary was not at the wedding\" implies that Mary was not present at the wedding, and the conditional statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" implies that Sue was at the wedding if Mary was at the wedding. Therefore, if Mary was not at the wedding, it is likely that Sue was not at the wedding as well.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
