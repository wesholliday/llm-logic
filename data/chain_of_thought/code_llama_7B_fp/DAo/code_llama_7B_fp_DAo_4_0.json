If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nTo infer whether the robot visited Jupiter, we need to consider the relationship between the statements. The first statement states that the alien did not visit Mars, while the second statement states that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that the robot did not visit Jupiter if the alien did not visit Mars. This is because the second statement implies that the robot visited Jupiter only if the alien visited Mars, and since the alien did not visit Mars, the robot did not visit Jupiter either.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
