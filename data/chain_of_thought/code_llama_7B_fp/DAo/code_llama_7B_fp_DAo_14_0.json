If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The wolf was not in the den,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we need to consider the first premise: \"The bear was not in the cave.\" This means that the bear is not present in the cave, which means that the wolf is not in the den either.\n\nSecond, we need to consider the second premise: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\" This means that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf is in the den. However, we already know that the bear is not in the cave, so this premise does not apply.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the wolf was not in the den.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
