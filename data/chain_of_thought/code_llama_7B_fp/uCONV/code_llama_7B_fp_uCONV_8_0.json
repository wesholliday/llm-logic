The mummy and vampire are both fictional characters in a story, and their awareness is not explicitly stated in the story. However, we can make an educated guess based on the information provided.\n\nIf the mummy was awake, then it is likely that the vampire was also awake. The mummy and vampire are both undead creatures, and they are both depicted as being able to move and act independently. It is possible that the mummy and vampire were both awake and able to interact with each other, even if they were not explicitly stated as being awake in the story.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
