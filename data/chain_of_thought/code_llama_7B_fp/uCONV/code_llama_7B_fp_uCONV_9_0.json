Lisa bought the red shirt.\n2. Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n3. If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nThe fallacy in this argument is that the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The fact that Mark bought the blue shirt does not necessarily mean that Lisa bought the red shirt, as there could be other people who bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: No.",
