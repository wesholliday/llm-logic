The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a correct inference, but the statement \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red\" is not a correct inference.\n\nThe reason for this is that the first statement is based on the assumption that the apple was red, which is not necessarily true. The second statement is simply an assumption that the banana was yellow, which is not necessarily true either. Therefore, we cannot infer that the apple was red based on the assumption that the banana was yellow.\n\nAnswer: No.",
