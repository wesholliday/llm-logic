            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis is a classic example of a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (Mary was at the wedding) is true. However, the statement \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\" is not a conditional statement, but rather an affirmation of the consequent (Sue was at the wedding).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding. In fact, it is possible that Sue was at the wedding without Mary being there.\n\nAnswer: No.",
