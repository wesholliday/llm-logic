This is a classic example of a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent.\n\nThe consequent is the statement that if the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. This statement is not necessarily true, as there are many other types of books that can be written by James.\n\nThe premise of the question is the assumption that the book is a mystery novel. This is not necessarily true, as there are many other types of books that can be written about mysteries.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. In fact, there are many other types of books that can be written by James that are not mystery novels.\n\nAnswer: No.",
