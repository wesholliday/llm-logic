Sam took a plane.\n2. Erin took a train.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n3. If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane.\n\nThe fallacy in this argument is that the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The fact that Erin took a train does not necessarily mean that Sam took a plane. There could be other factors that led to Sam taking a plane, such as a change in plans or a last-minute decision.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane\" is not necessarily true, and we cannot infer it from the premises.",
