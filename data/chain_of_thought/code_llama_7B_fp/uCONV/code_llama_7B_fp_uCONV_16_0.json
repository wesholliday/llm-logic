The fallacy occurs when we infer that if a certain condition is true, then a subsequent condition must also be true. In this case, we are inferring that if the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton.\n\nHowever, this is not necessarily true. There are many other types of pants that are not denim, and there are many other types of shirts that are not cotton. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton.\n\nAnswer: No.",
