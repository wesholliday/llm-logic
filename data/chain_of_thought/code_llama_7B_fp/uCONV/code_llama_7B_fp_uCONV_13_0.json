The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a correct inference, but the statement \"If the truck was blue, then the car was red\" is not a correct inference.\n\nThe reason for this is that the first statement is based on the assumption that the car was red, which is not necessarily true. The second statement is simply an inference based on the assumption that the truck was blue, which is also not necessarily true. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the truck was blue, then the car was red.\n\nAnswer: No.",
