The fallacy occurs when we infer that if one event occurs, then another event must occur, based solely on the fact that the first event occurred.\n\nIn this case, we are told that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. However, we are not given any information about whether Amy played tennis before Jeff played basketball. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball.\n\nAnswer: No.",
