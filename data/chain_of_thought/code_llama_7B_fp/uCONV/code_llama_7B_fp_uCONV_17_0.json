The fallacy occurs when we infer that if one event has occurred, then another event must have occurred based on the fact that the second event is known to have occurred.\n\nIn this case, we are told that Ben ate pasta, and we are asked to infer that if Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta. However, we are not given any information about the relationship between Ben and Kate, so we cannot make this inference.\n\nAnswer: No.",
