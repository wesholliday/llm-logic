The fallacy occurs when we infer that if a certain condition is true, then another condition must also be true, without considering the possibility that the second condition may not be true.\n\nIn this case, we are asked to infer that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. However, we are not given any information about the truck's material, so we cannot infer that the truck was metal based on the fact that the doll was plastic.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is no, we cannot infer that if the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic.",
