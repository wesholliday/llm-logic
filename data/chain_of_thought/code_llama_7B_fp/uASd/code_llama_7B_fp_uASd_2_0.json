However, the statement \"If we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time\" is a more specific and unlikely scenario, as it implies that we will have a good time even if a bomb goes off while we are at the concert.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time. The statement is too specific and unlikely to be true.\n\nAnswer: No.",
