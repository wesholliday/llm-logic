The answer is no, we cannot infer that.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe match is struck, and it will light. However, if the match is soaked in water, it will not light. The water will extinguish the flame. So, the inference that if the match is struck and it has been soaked in water, then it will light is not valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
