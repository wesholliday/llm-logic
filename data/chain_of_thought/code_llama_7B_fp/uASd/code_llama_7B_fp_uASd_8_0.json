The answer is no, we cannot infer that.\n\nThe fact that the package has shipped does not necessarily mean that it will arrive today, even if it was misrouted. The package could be delayed due to various reasons such as bad weather, traffic, or mechanical issues with the delivery vehicle.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to infer that the package will arrive today if it was misrouted. We need to wait for the delivery status to be updated to confirm when the package will arrive.",
