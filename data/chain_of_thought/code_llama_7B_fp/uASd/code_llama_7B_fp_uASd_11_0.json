Sleep is an essential component of physical and mental restoration, but it's not the only factor that determines fatigue.\n\nThere are many other factors that can contribute to fatigue, such as physical exertion, stress, and a lack of physical activity. Additionally, some people may be more prone to fatigue due to genetic or environmental factors.\n\nTherefore, it's not accurate to make a general inference that if you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired. It's important to consider all the individual factors that can contribute to fatigue and to consult with a healthcare professional if you're experiencing persistent fatigue.\n\nAnswer: No.",
