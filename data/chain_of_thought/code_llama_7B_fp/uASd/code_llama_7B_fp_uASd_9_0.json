There are many factors that can affect the grade a teacher assigns to a student's essay, such as the quality of the writing, the depth of the analysis, the relevance of the topic, and the overall coherence of the essay.\n\nIn this case, the student's essay may still be well-written and turned in late, but the teacher may still assign a lower grade due to other factors. Therefore, it is not accurate to infer that if the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A.\n\nAnswer: No.",
