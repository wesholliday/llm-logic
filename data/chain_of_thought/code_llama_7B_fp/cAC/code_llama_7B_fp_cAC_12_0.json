However, the statement \"Lucy went to the zoo\" does not necessarily imply that Joe went to the park.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that Joe went to the park based solely on the information that Lucy went to the zoo. We need more information to make a conclusion about Joe's whereabouts.\n\nAnswer: No.",
