The truck was metal.\n\nTo determine whether we can conclude that the doll was plastic, we need to analyze the premises and their logical relationships.\n\nFirstly, we need to determine whether the conclusion \"The doll was plastic\" logically follows from the given premises. To do this, we need to evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\nThe argument is valid if and only if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, we need to determine whether the conclusion can be deduced from the premises using the rules of logic.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can determine that the argument is valid if and only if the conclusion \"The doll was plastic\" logically follows from the premises \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" and \"The truck was metal.\"\n\nTo determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises, we need to evaluate the validity of the argument using the rules of logic.\n\nFirstly, we need to determine whether the premise \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is a valid premise. To do this, we need to evaluate the validity of the conditional statement.\n\nA conditional statement is valid if and only if the antecedent (the statement before the \"if\") is true and the consequent (the statement after the \"if\") is true. In this case, the antecedent is \"the doll was plastic\" and the consequent is \"the truck was metal.\"\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can determine that the antecedent \"the doll was plastic\" is true, and the consequent \"the truck was metal\" is true. Therefore, the conditional statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is valid.\n\nNext, we need to determine whether the premise \"The truck was metal\" is a valid premise. To do this, we need to evaluate the validity of the statement \"The truck was metal.\"\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can determine that the statement \"The truck was metal\" is a valid premise.\n\nNow, we can evaluate the validity of the argument using the rules of logic.\n\nIf the argument is valid, then the conclusion \"The doll was plastic\" logically follows from the premises \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" and \"The truck was metal.\"\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can determine that the argument is valid. Therefore, we can conclude that the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
