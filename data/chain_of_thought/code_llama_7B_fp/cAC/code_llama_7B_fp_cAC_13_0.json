This means that if the car was red, then the truck would also be blue.\n\nThe second premise states that the truck was blue. This means that the truck is blue, regardless of whether the car was red or not.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the car was red, because the first premise implies that the car was red, and the second premise confirms that the truck was blue.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
