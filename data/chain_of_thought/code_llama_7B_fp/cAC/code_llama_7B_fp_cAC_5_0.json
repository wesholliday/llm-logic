This means that if Jeff did play basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\n\nThe fact that Amy played tennis is a separate statement that is not directly related to the premise. However, it is possible that Amy played tennis because Jeff played basketball. In other words, the fact that Amy played tennis could be a consequence of Jeff playing basketball.\n\nTherefore, based on the premise and the fact that Amy played tennis, we can conclude that Jeff played basketball.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
