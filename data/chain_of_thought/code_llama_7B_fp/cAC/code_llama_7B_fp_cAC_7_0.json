Chris finished the race.\n\nTo determine whether we can conclude that Alex finished the race, we need to analyze the statements and determine whether they are logically consistent.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Alex finished the race) is true, then the consequent (Chris finished the race) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement simply states that Chris finished the race.\n\nTo determine whether we can conclude that Alex finished the race, we need to consider whether the antecedent of the conditional statement is true. If the antecedent is true, then we can conclude that the consequent must also be true, which means that Chris finished the race.\n\nHowever, we are not given any information about Alex's finishing the race. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alex finished the race based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No.",
