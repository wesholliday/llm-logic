            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statements are:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n2. Sue was at the wedding.\n\nTo determine whether we can conclude that Mary was at the wedding, we need to analyze the statements and their logical relationships.\n\nFirstly, we need to determine the meaning of the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the consequent (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true. The second statement is an unconditional statement, which means that it is always true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements in terms of their logical relationships. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that is true only if the antecedent is true. The second statement is an unconditional statement, which means that it is always true.\n\nBased on the given statements, we can conclude that Sue was at the wedding. However, we cannot conclude that Mary was at the wedding, because the first statement is a conditional statement, and we cannot conclude the antecedent (Mary was at the wedding) based on the second statement (Sue was at the wedding).\n\nAnswer: No.",
