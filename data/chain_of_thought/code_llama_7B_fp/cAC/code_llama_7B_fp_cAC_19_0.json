Jen watched basketball.\n\nTo determine whether we can conclude that Tom watched football, we need to analyze the statements and their logical relationships.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This means that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that Jen watched basketball.

The statements do not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No.",
