            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a process of elimination, where we can infer a specific part of a statement from a more general statement. The original statement says that the application must have been completed online and included references. This means that the completion of the application online is a necessary condition, but the inclusion of references is also a necessary condition. However, the statement does not imply that the application must have been completed online if it was not included references. Therefore, we can infer that the application must have been completed online, but we cannot infer that the application must have included references.\n\nAnswer: yes"
