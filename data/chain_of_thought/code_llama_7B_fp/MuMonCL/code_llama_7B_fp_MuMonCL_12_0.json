            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The project must have been completed by Friday' from 'The project must have been completed by Friday and under budget', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statement. The phrase 'and' is a conjunction that connects two independent clauses. In this case, the two clauses are 'The project must have been completed by Friday' and 'The project must have been completed under budget'. The word 'and' indicates that both conditions must be met. However, the second clause 'The project must have been completed under budget' does not provide any new information about the deadline, it only provides information about the budget. Therefore, we can infer that the project must have been completed by Friday, as it is a necessary condition for the entire statement to be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
