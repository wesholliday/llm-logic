            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The concert must have been sold out' from 'The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM', we need to analyze the logical structure of the sentence. The phrase 'and started at 8 PM' is a separate clause that provides additional information about the concert, but it doesn't affect the necessity of the concert being sold out. The phrase 'must have been sold out' is a separate statement that is not dependent on the time the concert started. Therefore, we can infer that the concert must have been sold out regardless of the time it started.\n\nAnswer: yes"
