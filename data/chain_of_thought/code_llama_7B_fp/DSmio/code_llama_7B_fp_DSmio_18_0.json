Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\n\nTo infer the third statement, \"The notebook is in the drawer,\" we need to consider the possible combinations of the given statements.\n\nIf the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand, then it must be in the drawer. This is because the second statement states that either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand. If the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand, then it must be in the drawer.\n\nOn the other hand, if the notebook is sitting on the nightstand, then it cannot be in the drawer. This is because the first statement states that the notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand. If the notebook is sitting on the nightstand, then it cannot be in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The notebook is in the drawer\" if the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
