Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\n\nTo infer the location of the remote control, we need to consider both statements and their logical relationships.\n\n1. The first statement suggests that the remote control might not be hiding under the couch, which means it could be anywhere else in the room.\n2. The second statement states that either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch. This statement implies that if the remote control is not on the coffee table, it must be hiding under the couch.\n\nBased on these statements, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
