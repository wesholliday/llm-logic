This is because the first statement suggests that the missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor, which implies that it is not blending in.\n\nSecond, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box based on the second statement. This statement suggests that either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor. Since we have already eliminated the possibility that the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor, we can conclude that the missing puzzle piece must be in the box.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
