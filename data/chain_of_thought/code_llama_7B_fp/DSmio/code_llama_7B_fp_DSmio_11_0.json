Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The newspaper is in the driveway,\" we need to consider the possible combinations of the given premises.\n\nIf the newspaper is not sitting on the porch, then it must be in the driveway. This is because the second premise states that either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch. If the newspaper is not sitting on the porch, then it must be in the driveway, as the second premise does not specify any other possibility.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The newspaper is in the driveway\" can be inferred from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
