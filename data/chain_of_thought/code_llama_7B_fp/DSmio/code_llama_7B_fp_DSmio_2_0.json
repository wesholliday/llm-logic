Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The book is on the shelf,\" we need to consider the possible interpretations of the given premises and the relationship between them.\n\nIf the book is not resting on the table, then it must be on the shelf. This is because the second premise states that either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table. If the book is not resting on the table, then it must be on the shelf, as the second premise implies.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the book is on the shelf, given the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
