Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\n\nWe can infer that Fido is inside because the first statement implies that Fido might not be in the garden, and the second statement states that either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden. Since the first statement is false (Fido is inside), the second statement must be true, and therefore Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
