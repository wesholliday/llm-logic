This is because the second statement states that either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet. If the jacket is not hanging in the closet, then it must be draped over the chair, as stated in the second statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The jacket is draped over the chair\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
