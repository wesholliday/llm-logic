The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\n2. Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\n\nIf the sunglasses are not perched on her head, then they must be in her bag. This is because the second statement states that either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head. If the sunglasses are not perched on her head, then they must be in her bag, as the second statement implies.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
