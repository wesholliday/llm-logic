            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical inference problem. The statement \"The document must have been signed or notarized\" is a disjunction, which means it is a statement that is true if at least one of the two conditions (being signed or notarized) is met. The word \"or\" is used to connect the two conditions, which means that if one of them is true, the entire statement is true. However, the statement does not imply that both conditions must be met. Therefore, we can infer that the document could have been either signed or notarized, but we cannot conclude that it must have been notarized.\n\nAnswer: no"
