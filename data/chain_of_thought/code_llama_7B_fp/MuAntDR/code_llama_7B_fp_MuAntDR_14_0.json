The statement says 'or', which is a disjunctive conjunction. This means that the contract must meet at least one of the conditions: it must have been valid for a year or it must have been renewable. The statement does not imply that both conditions must be met. Therefore, we can infer that the contract must have been renewable, but we cannot infer that it must have been valid for a year.\n\nAnswer: yes"
