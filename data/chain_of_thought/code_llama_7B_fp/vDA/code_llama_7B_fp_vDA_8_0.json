The conclusion does not follow from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This means that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would also be awake.\n\nThe second premise states that the vampire was not awake. This means that the vampire was not awake, and therefore the mummy was not awake.\n\nThe conclusion states that the mummy was not awake. This conclusion does not follow from the premises. If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy could have been awake or not awake. The argument does not provide enough information to determine whether the mummy was awake or not.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid.",
