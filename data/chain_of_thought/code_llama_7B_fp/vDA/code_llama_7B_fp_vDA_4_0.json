The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that the conclusion follows from the premise only if the condition is true. In this case, the condition is that the alien visited Mars. However, the second premise states that the alien did not visit Mars, which means that the condition is false. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises, and the argument is not valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
