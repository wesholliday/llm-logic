The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Sue chose pizza) is true, then the consequent (Bob chose pasta) must also be true. However, the second premise states that Sue did not choose pizza, which means that the antecedent is false. Therefore, the argument is not valid, as the conclusion (Bob did not choose pasta) is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: No.",
