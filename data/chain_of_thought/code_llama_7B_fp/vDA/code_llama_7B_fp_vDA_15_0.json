The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Sam took a plane) is true, then the consequent (Erin took a train) must also be true. However, the second premise states that Sam did not take a plane, which means that the antecedent is false. Therefore, the argument is not valid, as the conclusion (Erin did not take a train) is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: No.",
