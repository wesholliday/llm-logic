The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that the conclusion follows from the premise only if the condition is true. In this case, the condition is that Lisa bought the red shirt. However, the second premise states that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, which means that the condition is false. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises, and the argument is not valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
