The first premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. However, the second premise states that Jeff did not play basketball. This means that the assumption in the first premise, that Jeff played basketball, is false. Therefore, the conclusion, that Amy did not play tennis, is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: No.",
