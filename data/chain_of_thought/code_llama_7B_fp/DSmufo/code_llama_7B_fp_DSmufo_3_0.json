Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The keys are in the drawer,\" we need to consider the possible interpretations of the given premises and the relationship between them.\n\nIf the first premise is true, then it means that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet. This means that the keys could be in the drawer or they could be somewhere else.\n\nIf the second premise is true, then it means that either the keys are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer. This means that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, since the first premise states that this is not the case. Therefore, the only possibility is that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
