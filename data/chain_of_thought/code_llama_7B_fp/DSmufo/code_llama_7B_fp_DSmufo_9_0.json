If the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor, then it must be in the box.\n\nSecond, we can use the second premise to further support the conclusion that the missing puzzle piece is in the box. If the missing puzzle piece is in the box, then it is either blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
