Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The book is on the shelf,\" we need to use logical reasoning to connect the given premises.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the book is resting on the table by considering the negation of the first premise: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\" This means that the book is not necessarily resting on the table, and we can therefore conclude that the book is not necessarily on the table.\n\nNext, we can use the second premise to infer that the book is either on the table or on the shelf. This means that we can conclude that the book is on the shelf, as the second premise implies that the book is not on the table.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the conclusion \"The book is on the shelf\" based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
