Either the remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The remote control is on the coffee table,\" we need to consider the possible interpretations of the given premises and the logical relationships between them.\n\nThe first premise states that it is not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch. This means that the remote control is not necessarily hiding under the couch, and it is possible that it is on the coffee table or somewhere else.\n\nThe second premise states that either the remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table. This means that if the remote control is not hiding under the couch, then it must be on the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table, based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
