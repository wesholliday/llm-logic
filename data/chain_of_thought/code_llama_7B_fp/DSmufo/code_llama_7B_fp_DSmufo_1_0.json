Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside.\n\nWe want to infer the conclusion \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nTo do this, we need to use the rules of logic and the given premises to arrive at the conclusion.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that Fido must be in the garden by using the first premise. This means that Fido is not in the garden.\n\nNext, we can use the second premise to arrive at the conclusion that Fido is inside. This is because the second premise states that either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside, and we have already determined that Fido is not in the garden. Therefore, the only possibility left is that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
