The first premise states that it is not the case that the pen must be on my desk. This means that the pen is not necessarily on my desk, and it could be in my bag or somewhere else.\n\nThe second premise states that either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag. This means that if the pen is not on my desk, it must be in my bag.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the pen is in my bag, based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
