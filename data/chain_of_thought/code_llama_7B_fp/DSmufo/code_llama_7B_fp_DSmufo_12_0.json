Either the jacket must be hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The jacket is draped over the chair,\" we need to consider the possible interpretations of the given premises and the relationship between them.\n\nThe first premise states that it is not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet. This means that the jacket is not necessarily hanging in the closet, and it could be in any other location.\n\nThe second premise states that either the jacket must be hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair. This means that if the jacket is not hanging in the closet, it must be draped over the chair.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair, as the first premise states that it is not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet, and the second premise states that if the jacket is not hanging in the closet, it must be draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
