The first premise states that it is not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry, which means that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry. The second premise states that either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar. Since the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, the only possibility is that they are in the jar. Therefore, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
