The first premise states that it is not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom. This means that the cat is not playing in the bedroom, which implies that the cat is not in the bedroom at all.\n\nThe second premise states that either the cat must be playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch. This means that if the cat is not playing in the bedroom, then it must be napping on the couch.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
