The negation is \"it's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\" This means that the missing sock can be anywhere but under the bed.\n\nNext, we need to identify the biconditional in the second premise. The biconditional is \"Either the missing sock must be under the bed or it's in the laundry basket.\" This means that if the missing sock is not under the bed, then it must be in the laundry basket.\n\nNow, we can use the negation of the first premise to eliminate the possibility that the missing sock is under the bed. This means that the missing sock is not under the bed, and therefore it must be in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
