Either the newspaper must be sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The newspaper is in the driveway,\" we need to use logical reasoning to connect the given premises.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the newspaper is sitting on the porch by using the first premise. If the newspaper is not sitting on the porch, then it must be in the driveway.\n\nSecond, we can use the second premise to confirm that the newspaper is in the driveway. If the newspaper is in the driveway, then it must be either sitting on the porch or in the driveway. Since we have already eliminated the possibility that the newspaper is sitting on the porch, we can conclude that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
