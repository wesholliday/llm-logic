This is because the first statement negates the possibility that the milk must be chilling in the fridge, and the second statement states that the milk is either chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter. Since the first statement negates the possibility that the milk must be chilling in the fridge, it is logically possible that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
