This means that the flugel is not zargled, which implies that it is not blimmed.\n\nSecond, we can infer that the flugel is blimmed by the second statement. This statement implies that if the flugel is not zargled, then it must be blimmed. Since we have already determined that the flugel is not zargled, we can conclude that it is blimmed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The flugel is blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
