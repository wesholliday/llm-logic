This is because the second statement states that either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed. If the splat is not quanked, then it is not possible for it to be quanked, so it must be morphed.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The splat is morphed\" can be drawn from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
