'The fleeg might not be surned' means that the fleeg might not be surged, which means that it might not be moved or carried. 'Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered' means that either the fleeg must be surged or it must be bluttered, which means that the fleeg must be moved or carried or it must be in a state of bluttering.\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of logic and deduction to the given statements. If 'The fleeg might not be surned', then it is possible that the fleeg is not surged. If 'Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered', then it is necessary that the fleeg is surged or it is bluttered.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The fleeg is bluttered' if 'The fleeg might not be surned' and 'Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered' are both true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
