If the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed, then it cannot be the case that the flug might not be zimmed. Therefore, we can conclude that the flug must be zimmed.\n\nNext, we can infer that the flug is blummed by the first statement. If the flug might not be zimmed, then it is not necessarily blummed. However, if the flug must be zimmed, then it is blummed. Therefore, we can conclude that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
