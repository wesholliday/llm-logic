This is because the second statement states that if the wug is garpled, it is sproinged. Therefore, if the wug is not garpled, it must be sproinged.\n\nHowever, if the wug is garpled, then it is not sproinged. This is because the first statement states that the wug might not be garpled. Therefore, if the wug is garpled, it cannot be sproinged.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The wug is sproinged\" if the wug is not garpled, but not if it is garpled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
