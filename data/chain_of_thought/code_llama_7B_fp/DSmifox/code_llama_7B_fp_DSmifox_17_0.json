If the flob is movated, then it is not skizzled, so the second statement is not true. Therefore, we can conclude that the flob is not movated.\n\nNext, we can infer that the flob is skizzled based on the second statement. If the flob is not movated, then it must be skizzled, since the second statement states that either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flob is skizzled based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
