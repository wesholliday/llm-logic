This means that the dreb is not necessarily spent, and it could still be in existence.\n\nSecond, we can infer that \"Either the dreb must be spent or it is vroombed\" is a necessary condition for \"The dreb is vroombed.\" This means that if the dreb is not spent, it must be vroombed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The dreb is vroombed\" is a necessary and sufficient condition for the dreb to be vroombed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
