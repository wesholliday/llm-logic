Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The sprocket is cranked,\" we need to consider the possible combinations of the given statements.\n\nIf the sprocket is not daggled, then it is possible that it is cranked. In this case, the conclusion \"The sprocket is cranked\" can be inferred.\n\nHowever, if the sprocket is daggled, then it is not possible for it to be cranked. In this case, the conclusion \"The sprocket is cranked\" cannot be inferred.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The sprocket is cranked\" can be inferred if the sprocket is not daggled, but it cannot be inferred if the sprocket is daggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
