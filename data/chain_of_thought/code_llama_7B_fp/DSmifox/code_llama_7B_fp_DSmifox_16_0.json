If the sneg is sproted, then it must be supported, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, we can conclude that the sneg is not sproted.\n\nSecond, we can infer that the sneg is crampled by the second statement. If the sneg must be sproted or it is crampled, and it is not sproted, then it must be crampled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sneg is crampled based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
