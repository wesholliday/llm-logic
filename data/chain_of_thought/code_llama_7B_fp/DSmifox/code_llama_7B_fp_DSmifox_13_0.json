This means that the glip is either tragged or it is slogged.\n\nSecond, we can infer that the glip is slogged by the second statement. This means that if the glip is not tragged, it must be slogged.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the glip is slogged based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
