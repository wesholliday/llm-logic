The given statement is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\" This statement is the opposite of the first statement, but it is still a logical deduction. If Sue was not at the wedding, then it is possible that Mary was not at the wedding. However, it is not necessarily true that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\" from \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
