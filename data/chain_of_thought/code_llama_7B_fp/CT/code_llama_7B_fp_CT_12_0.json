            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis is a classic example of a logical deduction problem. The given premise is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" We need to infer whether \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\" is also true.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to analyze the given premise and the conclusion we want to draw. The premise states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. This means that if Joe did go to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion we want to draw. If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then she did not go to the zoo. This means that if Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
