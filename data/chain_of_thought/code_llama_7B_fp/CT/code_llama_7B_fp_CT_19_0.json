            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis is a classic example of a logical deduction. The given premise is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" We can infer the conclusion \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\" by using the contrapositive method.\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement is the negation of the conclusion. In this case, the contrapositive of \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nThe contrapositive method involves assuming the negation of the conclusion and showing that it logically follows from the premises. In this case, we can assume that Jen did not watch basketball and show that it logically follows that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
