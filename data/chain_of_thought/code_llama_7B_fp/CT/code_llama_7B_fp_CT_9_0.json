            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis is a classic example of a logical deduction problem. The given premise is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" We need to infer whether \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" is also true.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. Mark bought the blue shirt and Lisa bought the red shirt. In this case, the premise is true, and the conclusion is also true.\n2. Mark did not buy the blue shirt and Lisa bought the red shirt. In this case, the premise is false, and the conclusion is also false.\n3. Mark bought the blue shirt and Lisa did not buy the red shirt. In this case, the premise is true, but the conclusion is false.\n4. Mark did not buy the blue shirt and Lisa did not buy the red shirt. In this case, the premise is false, and the conclusion is also false.\n\nBased on the above scenarios, we can conclude that the inference \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" is not necessarily true. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nAnswer: No",
