However, it does not necessarily mean that if the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\n\nFor example, if the car was red and the truck was blue, then the statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is true. But if the truck was not blue, then the statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is still true, but it does not imply that the car was not red.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\" from \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
