            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis is a classic example of a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. The fallacy occurs when we assume that because one statement is true, the other statement must also be true. In this case, we are assuming that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\n\nFor example, imagine that the doll was actually made of wood, and the truck was made of plastic. In this case, the statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" would still be true, even though the conclusion does not logically follow.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\" based on the assumption that \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"",
