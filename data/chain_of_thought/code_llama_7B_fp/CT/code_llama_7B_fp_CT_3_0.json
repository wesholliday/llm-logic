The first condition is that the book was written by James, and the second condition is that the book is a mystery novel. The statement is saying that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\" This statement is also a conditional statement, but it is the opposite of the first statement. It is saying that if the book is not a mystery novel, then it cannot have been written by James.\n\nThe two statements are related because they are both conditional statements that imply a relationship between the two conditions. The first statement implies that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. The second statement implies that if the book is not a mystery novel, then it cannot have been written by James.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James. This is because the first statement implies that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel, and the second statement implies that if the book is not a mystery novel, then it cannot have been written by James.",
