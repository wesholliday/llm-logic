However, it does not necessarily mean that if Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nFor example, Jeff could have played basketball and Amy could have not played tennis for various reasons. In this case, the statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" would still be true, but the inference \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\" would not be true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\" from the statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\".",
