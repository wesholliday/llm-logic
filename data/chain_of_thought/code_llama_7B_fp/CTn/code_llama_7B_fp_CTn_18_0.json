This means that the truck is not metal, and therefore, it is possible that the doll is not plastic.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that the doll is plastic. It is possible that the doll is made of a different material, such as wood or fabric, that is not plastic.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic\" based on the information provided. We need more information to make a conclusion about the material of the doll.",
