However, this does not necessarily mean that the conclusion logically implies the premise.\n\nFor example, if the griffin was in the forest and the unicorn was not in the forest, then the statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest\" is true. However, this does not mean that the statement \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\" is necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\" from \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
