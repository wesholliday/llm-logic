The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is true if and only if the condition is true. In this case, the condition is \"If the book was written by James.\"\n\nThe second statement is also a conditional statement, which means that it is true if and only if the condition is true. In this case, the condition is \"If the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship between the two statements. If the first statement is true, then the book was not written by James. This means that the book is not a mystery novel. Therefore, the second statement is true.\n\nOn the other hand, if the second statement is true, then the book is a mystery novel. This means that the book was written by James. Therefore, the first statement is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the second statement from the first statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
