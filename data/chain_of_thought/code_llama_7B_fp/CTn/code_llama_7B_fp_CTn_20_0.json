The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow\" is an example of this fallacy because it implies that the opposite of the conclusion is true. In other words, it is saying that if the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow, but it does not say anything about the banana being yellow or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red\" from the original statement. The original statement only implies that the apple was not red, and it does not provide any information about the banana.\n\nAnswer: No.",
