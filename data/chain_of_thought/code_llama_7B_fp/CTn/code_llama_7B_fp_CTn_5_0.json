This means that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\n\nHowever, it does not necessarily mean that if Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball. There could be other factors that led to Jeff not playing basketball, such as a personal preference or a lack of interest.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball. We can only infer that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.",
