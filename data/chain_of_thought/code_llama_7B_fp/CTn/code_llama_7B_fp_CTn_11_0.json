However, this does not necessarily mean that the opposite of the conclusion (the muffins were blueberry) implies the opposite of the premise (the cake was not chocolate).\n\nFor example, if the cake was chocolate and the muffins were blueberry, then the statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry\" would be true. However, this does not mean that the statement \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\" would also be true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\" from \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
