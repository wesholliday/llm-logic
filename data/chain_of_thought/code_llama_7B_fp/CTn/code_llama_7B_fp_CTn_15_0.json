In this case, the first condition is \"If Sam took a plane,\" and the second condition is \"then Erin did not take a train.\"\n\nTo infer the second condition from the first condition, we need to analyze the relationship between the two conditions. The first condition states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin did not take a train. This means that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
