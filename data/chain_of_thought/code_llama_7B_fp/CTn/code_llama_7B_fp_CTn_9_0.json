In this case, the original statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\" The converse of this statement would be \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\nHowever, this converse is not necessarily true. It is possible that Mark bought the blue shirt and Lisa did not buy the red shirt, even if Mark did not buy the blue shirt because Lisa bought the red shirt. In other words, the converse of the original statement does not logically follow from the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" from \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"",
