            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis argument is logically valid because the first premise is a conditional statement, which is a valid form of argument. The conditional statement is in the form of \"If A, then B,\" where A is the antecedent and B is the consequent. In this case, the antecedent is \"the shirt was cotton\" and the consequent is \"the pants were denim.\"\n\nThe second premise is also a valid statement, as it is a fact that the shirt was cotton.\n\nThe conclusion is also a valid statement, as it is a conclusion that logically follows from the premises. The conclusion is \"The pants were denim,\" which is a valid statement because it is a fact that the pants were indeed denim.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it is a valid form of argument with valid premises and a valid conclusion.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
