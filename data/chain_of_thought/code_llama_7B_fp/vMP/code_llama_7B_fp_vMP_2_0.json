The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. This is a conditional statement, which means that the conclusion follows from the premise if a certain condition is met. In this case, the condition is that the griffin was in the forest.\n\nThe second premise states that the griffin was in the forest. This is a factual statement, and it is not necessarily related to the first premise.\n\nThe conclusion states that the unicorn was in the forest. This is also a factual statement, and it is not necessarily related to the first premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.",
