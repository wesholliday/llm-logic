This means that Tom watched football, but it does not necessarily mean that Jen watched basketball.\n\nThe conclusion states that Jen watched basketball. This means that Jen watched basketball, but it does not necessarily mean that Tom watched football.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.",
