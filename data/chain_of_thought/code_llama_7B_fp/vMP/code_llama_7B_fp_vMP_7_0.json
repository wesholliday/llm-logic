The first premise states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. The second premise states that Alex finished the race. The conclusion states that Chris finished the race, which is a direct result of the first premise.\n\nTherefore, this argument is logically valid because it uses a conditional statement in its conclusion, which is a valid form of argumentation.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
