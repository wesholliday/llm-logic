The argument is based on a conditional statement, which means that the conclusion follows from the premises only if the premises are true. In this case, the premise \"The car was red\" is true, but the conclusion \"The truck was blue\" is not necessarily true.\n\nTo see why, consider the possibility that the car was not red, but the truck was blue. In this case, the premise \"The car was red\" would be false, but the conclusion \"The truck was blue\" would still be true. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
