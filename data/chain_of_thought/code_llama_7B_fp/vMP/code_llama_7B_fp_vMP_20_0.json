The argument assumes that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. However, this is not necessarily true. The apple and banana are two separate objects, and their colors do not necessarily determine each other's colors.\n\nFor example, imagine that the apple was red because it was a type of apple that is commonly associated with red fruit, but it was not actually red in color. Similarly, the banana could be yellow even if it was not actually yellow in color. In this case, the argument would be false, even though the second premise is true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.",
