The argument is based on a conditional statement, which means that the conclusion only follows if the premises are true. In this case, the premise \"Joe went to the park\" is not sufficient to guarantee that Lucy went to the zoo. There could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo, such as she wanted to see the animals or she was invited by someone else. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
