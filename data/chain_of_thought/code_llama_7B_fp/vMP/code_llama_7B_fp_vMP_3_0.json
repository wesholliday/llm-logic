            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis argument is logically valid because it uses a conditional statement (if-then) in the first premise, which is a valid form of argumentation. The first premise states that if the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. This implies that the book is a mystery novel, but it does not necessarily mean that the book was written by James.\n\nThe second premise states that the book was written by James. This is a factual statement that is independent of the first premise.\n\nThe conclusion states that the book is a mystery novel. This is a conclusion that logically follows from the first premise and the second premise.\n\nTherefore, this argument is logically valid because it uses a valid form of argumentation (conditional statement) and the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
