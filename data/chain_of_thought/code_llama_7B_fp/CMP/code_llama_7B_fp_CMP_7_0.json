    "user_prompt": "Suppose that tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources. Forecasts indicate it\u2019s likely tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. These are the only major sources, so if solar power doesn\u2019t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn\u2019t, wind power will. Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will\" can be logically deduced from the given information.\n\nFirstly, it is mentioned that tidal power is likely to generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. This suggests that tidal power is the leading renewable energy source and is likely to generate the most electricity.\n\nSecondly, it is mentioned that if solar power doesn't generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn't, wind power will. This implies that if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will likely take its place as the leading renewable energy source.\n\nFinally, it is stated that tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't. This suggests that tidal power is likely to generate the most electricity, which means that wind power will likely take its place as the leading renewable energy source if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, it can be logically deduced that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
