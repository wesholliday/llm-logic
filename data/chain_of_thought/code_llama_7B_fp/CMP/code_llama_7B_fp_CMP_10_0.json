    "user_prompt": "Suppose that spring, summer, and winter are the most popular travel seasons. Forecasts show it's likely most vacations this year will happen in spring, followed closely by summer, with many fewer happening in the winter. These are by far the top seasons, so if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will. Moreover, spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

Since summer is the second most popular travel season, it's likely that many vacations will happen in the summer.\n3. If many vacations happen in the summer, it's likely that the number of travelers will be higher in the summer than in the spring.\n4. If the number of travelers is higher in the summer than in the spring, it's likely that the number of vacations will be higher in the summer than in the spring.\n5. Since it's unlikely that the number of vacations will be higher in the winter than in the spring, it's likely that if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
