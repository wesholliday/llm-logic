    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it\u2019s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn\u2019t get the offer, then if Priya doesn\u2019t, Diego will. Moreover, it\u2019s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn\u2019t get the offer, Diego will?",

If Priya doesn't get the offer, then it is likely that Diego will get the offer. However, if Julian doesn't get the offer, then it is not necessarily true that Diego will get the offer.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is \"yes\" because if Priya doesn't get the offer, then it is likely that Diego will get the offer. However, if Julian doesn't get the offer, then it is not necessarily true that Diego will get the offer.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
