    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Ford, Toyota, and Honda lead US auto sales. Industry analysis expects Ford will sell the most vehicles this year, followed closely by Toyota, with Honda lagging significantly behind. These brands lead the market, so if Toyota isn\u2019t #1 in sales, then if Ford isn\u2019t, Honda will be. Moreover, Ford likely will lead in sales and hence Toyota likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Ford doesn\u2019t lead in sales, Honda will?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If Ford doesn't lead in sales, Honda will\" can be logically inferred from the given information. The analysis suggests that Ford is expected to lead in sales this year, followed closely by Toyota, and Honda lagging significantly behind. If Ford doesn't lead in sales, it is likely that Toyota will take its place as the top seller. However, this does not necessarily mean that Honda will not lead in sales.\n\nThere are several factors that could affect Honda's sales, such as changes in the market, competition, or pricing strategies. Therefore, it is not necessarily true that Honda will not lead in sales if Ford doesn't.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
