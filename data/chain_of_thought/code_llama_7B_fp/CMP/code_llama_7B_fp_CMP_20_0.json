    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers\" can be logically deduced from the given information.\n\nFirstly, the statement \"coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers\" is based on the assumption that coffee is the most popular morning beverage. This assumption is supported by the fact that coffee is the most popular morning drink, as indicated by market research.\n\nSecondly, the statement \"tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers\" is based on the assumption that tea is the second most popular morning beverage. This assumption is supported by the fact that tea is the second most popular morning drink, as indicated by market research.\n\nThirdly, the statement \"soda consumed much less in the mornings\" is based on the assumption that soda is the least popular morning beverage. This assumption is supported by the fact that soda is consumed much less in the mornings compared to coffee and tea.\n\nTherefore, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, it is likely that soda will retain the most morning drinkers. This is because soda is the least popular morning beverage, and if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, it is likely that soda will take its place as the most popular morning drink.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
