    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the Lakers, Warriors, and Celtics have the best odds to win the NBA championship. Based on expert projections, it is most likely the Lakers will win, followed closely by the Warriors, with the Celtics having much lower odds. These are the only top contenders, so if the Warriors don\u2019t win, then if the Lakers don\u2019t win, the Celtics will win. Moreover, it is most likely the Lakers will win and hence that the Warriors won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the Lakers don\u2019t win, the Celtics will?",

If the Warriors don't win, then it is likely that the Lakers will win, as they have the best odds. However, if the Lakers don't win, it is also possible that the Celtics will win, as they have lower odds.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that it is likely that, if the Lakers don't win, the Celtics will. It is possible that the Warriors will win, in which case the Celtics will not win.\n\nAnswer: No.",
