    "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it\u2019s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be. Moreover, it\u2019s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"if apples aren't the top-selling fruit, oranges will be\" can be logically deduced from the given information. The information states that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits, and that apples are likely to be the top-selling fruit this year. If apples are not the top-selling fruit, then it is likely that bananas will be, as they are the second most purchased fruit. Moreover, the information states that oranges are the third most purchased fruit, so if apples are not the top-selling fruit, oranges will likely be.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
