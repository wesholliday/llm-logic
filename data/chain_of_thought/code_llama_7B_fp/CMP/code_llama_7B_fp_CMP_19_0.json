    "user_prompt": "Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don\u2019t increase the most, then if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won\u2019t increase the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement is a conditional statement, and it is asking whether it is likely that if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. The statement is based on the assumption that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year, and that rents are expected to increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less.\n\nTo determine whether it is likely that if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most, we need to analyze the reasoning behind the statement. The statement is based on the assumption that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year, and that rents are expected to increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less.\n\nIf rents don't increase the most, it is likely that mortgage rates will increase the most. This is because mortgage rates are expected to rise much less than rents and home prices, and if rents don't increase the most, it is likely that mortgage rates will increase the most.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes. It is likely that if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most.",
