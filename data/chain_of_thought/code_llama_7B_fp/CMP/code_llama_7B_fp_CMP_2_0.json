    "user_prompt": "Suppose that banana bread, chocolate chip cookies, and carrot cake are the most popular baked goods. According to a consumer survey, it is very likely that banana bread will be the top seller, followed closely by chocolate chip cookies, with carrot cake far behind. These are the only top sellers, so if chocolate chip cookies aren\u2019t the top seller, then if banana bread isn\u2019t, carrot cake will be. Moreover, it is likely banana bread will be top and hence that chocolate chip cookies won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if banana bread isn\u2019t the top seller, carrot cake will be?",

The survey results suggest that banana bread is the most popular baked good, followed by chocolate chip cookies, and carrot cake is far behind. If banana bread isn't the top seller, then it is likely that chocolate chip cookies will be, and therefore it is unlikely that carrot cake will be the top seller.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
