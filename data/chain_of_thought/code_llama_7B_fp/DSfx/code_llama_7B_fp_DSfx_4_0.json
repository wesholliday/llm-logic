This means that the fribble is either snurgled or not crinked.\n\nSecond, we can deduce that 'The fribble is snurgled' from the second premise. This means that the fribble is not crinked, and therefore it must be snurgled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The fribble is snurgled' from 'Either the fribble is crinked or it is snurgled' together with 'The fribble is not crinked'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
