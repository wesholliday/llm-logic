            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer \"The dreb is vroombed\" from \"Either the dreb is spended or it is vroombed\" together with \"The dreb is not spended\", we need to use logical reasoning and the principles of deduction.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the meaning of the given statements. \"Either the dreb is spended or it is vroombed\" means that the dreb is either spent or vroombed, and \"The dreb is not spended\" means that the dreb is not spent.\n\nNext, we need to identify the premises and the conclusion. The premises are \"Either the dreb is spended or it is vroombed\" and \"The dreb is not spended\", and the conclusion is \"The dreb is vroombed\".\n\nNow, we need to use the rules of deduction to infer the conclusion from the premises. The rule of deduction is:\n\nIf A is true, and B is true, and A implies B, then B is true.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nA = \"Either the dreb is spended or it is vroombed\"\nB = \"The dreb is vroombed\"\n\nWe also have:\n\nA implies B, because if the dreb is either spent or vroombed, then it must be vroombed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that B is true, and the conclusion \"The dreb is vroombed\" is logically deduced from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
