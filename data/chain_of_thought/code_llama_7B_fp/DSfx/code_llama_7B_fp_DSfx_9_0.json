Either the twonk is varnished or it is plinked.\n2. The twonk is not plinked.\n\nTo infer the conclusion, we need to use the first premise to eliminate the possibility that the twonk is plinked. If the twonk is plinked, then it cannot be varnished, since the two statements are mutually exclusive. Therefore, we can conclude that the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
