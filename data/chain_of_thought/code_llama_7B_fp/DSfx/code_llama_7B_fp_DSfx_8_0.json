            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The sprocket is cranked\" from the premises \"Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked\" and \"The sprocket is not daggled,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the principles of deduction.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the relationship between the premises. The first premise states that either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked. The second premise states that the sprocket is not daggled.\n\nNext, we need to determine whether the conclusion \"The sprocket is cranked\" is logically implied by the premises. To do this, we need to consider the possible interpretations of the words \"either\" and \"not.\"\n\nIf \"either\" means \"at least one of,\" then the first premise implies that the sprocket is either daggled or cranked. If \"not\" means \"not both,\" then the second premise implies that the sprocket is not both daggled and cranked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
