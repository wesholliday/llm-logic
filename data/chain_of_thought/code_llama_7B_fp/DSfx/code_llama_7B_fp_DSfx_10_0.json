'Either the wug is garpled or it is sproinged' means that the wug is either being garpled or it is being sproonged. 'The wug is not garpled' means that the wug is not being garpled.\n\nNow, let's apply the principles of deduction. If we know that either the wug is garpled or it is sproonged, and we also know that the wug is not garpled, then we can infer that the wug is sproonged. This is because if the wug is not garpled, then it must be sproonged.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes. We can infer that the wug is sproonged from the given statements.",
