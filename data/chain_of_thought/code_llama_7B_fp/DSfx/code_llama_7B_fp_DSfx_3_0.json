Therefore, if the splat is quanked, we cannot infer that it is morphed.\n\nOn the other hand, if the splat is not quanked, then it is either morphed or not morphed. If the splat is not morphed, then it is not quanked, as the two statements are also mutually exclusive. Therefore, if the splat is not quanked, we can infer that it is morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
