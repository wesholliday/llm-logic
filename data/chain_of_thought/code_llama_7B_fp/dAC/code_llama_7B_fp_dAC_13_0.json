The first statement, \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue,\" implies that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. This means that if the car was red, then we can conclude that the truck was blue.\n\nThe second statement, \"The truck was blue,\" confirms that the truck was indeed blue. This means that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. Therefore, we can deduce that the car was red.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
