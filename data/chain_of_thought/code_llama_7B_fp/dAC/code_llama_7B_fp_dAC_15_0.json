If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n2. Erin took a train.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. This means that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train, and vice versa.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that Erin took a train. This means that Erin did not take a plane, since the first statement states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n\nTherefore, we can deduce that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
