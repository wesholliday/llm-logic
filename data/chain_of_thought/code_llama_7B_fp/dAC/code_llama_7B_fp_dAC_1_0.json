The first premise, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. The second premise, \"Sue was at the wedding,\" states that Sue was indeed at the wedding. Therefore, we can logically deduce that Mary was also at the wedding, as the two premises are consistent with each other.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
