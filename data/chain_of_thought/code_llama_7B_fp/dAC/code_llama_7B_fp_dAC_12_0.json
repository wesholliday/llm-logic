This means that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nThe second sentence, \"Lucy went to the zoo,\" simply states that Lucy went to the zoo. It does not provide any information about whether Joe went to the park or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot deduce whether Joe went to the park or not based on the two sentences provided. The information provided is incomplete and does not allow us to make a conclusion about Joe's whereabouts.\n\nAnswer: No.",
