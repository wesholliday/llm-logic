The first premise states that if the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. The second premise states that the book is a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of deduction. We need to start with the conclusion, which is 'The book was written by James'. We then need to use the premises to arrive at the conclusion.\n\nUsing the first premise, we can deduce that if the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. This means that if the book is a mystery novel, then it was written by James.\n\nUsing the second premise, we can deduce that the book is a mystery novel. This means that the book was written by James.\n\nTherefore, we can deduce that 'The book was written by James' from 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' and 'The book is a mystery novel'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
