The premise \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is not necessarily true, as there may be other factors that could have caused Sue to be at the wedding without Mary being there. Therefore, the conclusion \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\" is not necessarily true either.\n\nAnswer: No.",
