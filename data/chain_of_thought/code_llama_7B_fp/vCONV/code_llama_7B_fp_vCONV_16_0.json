The premise states that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. However, the conclusion states that if the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton. This is a reversal of the premise, as the conclusion implies that the shirt was cotton, which is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: No.",
