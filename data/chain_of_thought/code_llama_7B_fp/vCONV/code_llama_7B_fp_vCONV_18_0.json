The conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nThe premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. This is a conditional statement, which means that the conclusion is only true if the premise is true. However, the conclusion states that if the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic. This is also a conditional statement, but it is not necessarily true that if the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic.\n\nFor the argument to be logically valid, the conclusion would need to logically follow from the premise. In this case, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise, so the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
