The conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nThe premise states that if the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. This is a conditional statement, which means that the conclusion (the book is a mystery novel) is only true if the premise (the book was written by James) is true.\n\nThe conclusion states that if the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James. This is also a conditional statement, which means that the conclusion (the book was written by James) is only true if the premise (the book is a mystery novel) is true.\n\nHowever, the premise and conclusion are not logically equivalent. The premise states that the book is a mystery novel if it was written by James, while the conclusion states that the book was written by James if it is a mystery novel. These two statements are not the same, and therefore the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
