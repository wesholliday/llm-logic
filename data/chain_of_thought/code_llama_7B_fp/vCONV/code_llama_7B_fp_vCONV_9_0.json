In other words, the premise does not entail the conclusion.\n\nTo see why, let's consider the possible worlds interpretation of the argument. In this interpretation, the premise and conclusion are both true, but the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nPremise: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\nConclusion: If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nNow, suppose that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, and Mark did buy the blue shirt. This means that the premise is false, but the conclusion is still true. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
