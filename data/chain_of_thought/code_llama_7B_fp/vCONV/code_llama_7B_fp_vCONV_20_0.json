The premise \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is not necessarily true, as there are many possible reasons why the apple might not be red, such as it being a different variety or having been picked at a different time. Similarly, the conclusion \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red\" is not necessarily true, as there are many possible reasons why the banana might not be yellow, such as it being a different variety or having been picked at a different time.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid because it is based on a false premise and a false conclusion.",
