The conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nThe premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This means that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would also be awake. However, the conclusion states that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake. This means that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire would also be awake.\n\nHowever, this argument is not valid because the premise does not logically follow from the conclusion. The conclusion does not provide any evidence or reason to support the idea that the vampire was awake if the mummy was awake. In fact, the conclusion states the opposite, that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid.",
