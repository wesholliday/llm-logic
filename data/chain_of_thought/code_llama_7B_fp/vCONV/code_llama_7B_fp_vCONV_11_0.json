The premise states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. However, the conclusion states that if the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate. This is a conditional statement, and it is not necessarily true that if the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate.\n\nFor example, imagine that the cake was chocolate, but the muffins were not blueberry. In this case, the premise would be true, but the conclusion would not be true. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
