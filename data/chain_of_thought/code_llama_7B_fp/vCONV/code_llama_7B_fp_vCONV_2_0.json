The conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nThe premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. This means that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was also in the forest.\n\nThe conclusion states that if the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was in the forest. This means that if the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was also in the forest.\n\nHowever, the premise does not logically guarantee that the unicorn was in the forest. It only states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: No.",
