However, the statement 'The project must have been completed by Friday or next week' implies that the project was completed on or before next week, which is a broader time frame. The original statement does not provide any information about the project's status after Friday, so we cannot infer that it must have been completed by next week. The two statements are not logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: no"
