            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The exam must have been difficult\" implies that the exam was indeed challenging, as the word \"difficult\" is a synonym for \"challenging\". The use of \"must have been\" suggests a conclusion or inference based on the outcome of the exam, which is that it was challenging.
