            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical inference using the principle of addition. The original statement \"The keys must be in the drawer\" implies that the keys are definitely in the drawer, but it does not provide any information about their location outside of the drawer. To infer that the keys must be in the drawer or on the table, we would need additional information that suggests the keys are not in the drawer but are instead on the table. However, the original statement does not provide this information, so we cannot make this inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
