            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is \"The zazzle must be crunk and it must be flonk by crunk\". The word \"it\" is a pronoun that refers back to \"the zazzle\". The phrase \"by crunk\" is a prepositional phrase that modifies the verb \"must be flonk\". Since \"it\" refers to \"the zazzle\", we can infer that \"the zazzle\" is the subject of the verb \"must be flonk\". Therefore, we can rewrite the original statement as \"The zazzle must be crunk and the zazzle must be flonk by crunk\". This is equivalent to \"The zazzle must be crunk and the zazzle must be flonk by crunk\", which is the same as \"The zazzle must be crunk and flonk by crunk\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
