            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The room must have been cleaned daily' implies that cleaning the room is a regular and routine task, but it does not provide any information about whether the cleaning is done upon request or not. The word \"must\" suggests a requirement or a necessity, but it does not specify the circumstances under which the cleaning is done. Therefore, we cannot infer that the room is cleaned upon request, as the original statement only mentions that it is cleaned daily, without any additional conditions.\n\nAnswer: no"
