However, the statement 'The package must have been delivered tomorrow or today' is a broader statement that includes the possibility of the package being delivered on the next day, which is not necessarily implied by the original statement. The original statement does not provide any information about the package being delivered on the next day, so we cannot infer that it must have been delivered tomorrow.\n\nAnswer: no"
