            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The concert must have been sold out' implies that the concert had reached its capacity, meaning all available tickets had been purchased. This does not necessarily imply that the concert was postponed. Postponement would mean that the concert was originally scheduled for a different date, which is not indicated by the statement. Therefore, we can infer that the concert was sold out, but we cannot infer that it was postponed.\n\nAnswer: no"
