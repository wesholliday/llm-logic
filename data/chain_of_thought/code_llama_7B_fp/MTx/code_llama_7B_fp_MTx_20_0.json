If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\n2. The fleeg did not surn.\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it would have surpassed or outdone something. However, we know that the fleeg did not surn, which means that it did not surpass or outdo anything.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the fleeg was not bluttered, since if it was bluttered, it would have surpassed or outdone something, but it did not.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
