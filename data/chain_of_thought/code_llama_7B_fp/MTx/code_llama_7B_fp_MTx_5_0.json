'If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled' means that if the zinger was fraggled, it would have been smoogled. 'The zinger was not smoogled' means that the zinger was not smoogled.\n\nNow, let's apply the principles of deduction. If the premise 'If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled' is true, and the conclusion 'The zinger was not smoogled' is true, then we can infer that the premise 'The zinger was fraggled' is false.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes. We can infer that 'The zinger was not fraggled' from 'If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled' together with 'The zinger was not smoogled'.",
