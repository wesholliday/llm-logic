The premises are independent statements, so we can infer the conclusion without assuming any additional information.\n2. The conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises, so it is a valid inference.\n3. The conclusion is not contradictory to the premises, so it is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
