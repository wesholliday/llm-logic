We need to use the principle of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time.\n\nIf we assume that \"The smonk was vreebled,\" then we can infer that \"The smonk plagged\" because \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\" However, this assumption leads to a contradiction, because \"The smonk did not plagged\" is also true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The smonk was not vreebled\" from \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged\" together with \"The smonk did not plagged.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
