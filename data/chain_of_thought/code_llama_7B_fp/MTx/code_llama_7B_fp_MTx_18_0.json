The shank was not nugged.\n\nTo infer the conclusion, we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\n1. Premise 1: If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\n2. Premise 2: The shank was not nugged.\n3. Conclusion: The shank was not plooked.\n\nTo draw the conclusion, we need to use the following rule of inference:\n\nIf A implies B, and B is false, then A is false.\n\nIn this case, we have two premises:\n\n1. If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\n2. The shank was not nugged.\n\nWe can infer that the shank was not plooked because the second premise contradicts the first premise. If the shank was plooked, then it would have been nugged, but since it was not nugged, we can conclude that the shank was not plooked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
