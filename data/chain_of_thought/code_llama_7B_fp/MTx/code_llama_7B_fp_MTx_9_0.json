If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished. This means that if the twonk was hit with a plink, it would be coated with a layer of varnish.\n\nHowever, we are given that the twonk was not varnished. This means that the twonk was not coated with varnish, even if it was plinked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the twonk was not plinked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
