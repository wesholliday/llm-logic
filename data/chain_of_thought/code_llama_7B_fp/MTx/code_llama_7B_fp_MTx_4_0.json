The premises are:\n\t* If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\n\t* The fribble did not crink.\n2. The conclusion we want to draw is:\n\t* The fribble was not snurgled.\n\nTo draw this conclusion, we need to use the first premise to infer that the fribble crinked, given that it was snurgled. Then, we can use the second premise to infer that the fribble did not crink, which contradicts the conclusion we want to draw. Therefore, we can conclude that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
