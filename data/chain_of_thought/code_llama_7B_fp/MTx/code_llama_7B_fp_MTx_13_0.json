If we assume that the glip was slogged, then we can infer that the glip was tragged. However, if we also know that the glip was not tragged, then we can infer that the glip was not slogged.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The glip was not slogged\" from \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\" together with \"The glip was not tragged.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
