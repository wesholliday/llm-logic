If the flug was blummed, then it was zimmed. Therefore, if the flug was not zimmed, it was not blummed. In other words, if the flug was not compressed, it was not blurred.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The flug was not blummed\" from \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed\" together with \"The flug was not zimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
