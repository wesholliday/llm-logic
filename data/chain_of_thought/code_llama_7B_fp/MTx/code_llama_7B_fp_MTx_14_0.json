The premise 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged' is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the clug was fleeked) is true, then the consequent (the clug snugged) must also be true.\n2. The premise 'The clug did not snugged' is a negative statement, which means that the clug did not perform the action of snugging.\n3. Based on the given premises, we can infer that if the clug was fleeked, then it must have snugged. Therefore, if the clug did not snug, then it must not have been fleeked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
