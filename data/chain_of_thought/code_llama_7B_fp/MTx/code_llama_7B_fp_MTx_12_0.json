We need to use the premises to deduce the conclusion. The conclusion is \"The smip was not shripped\".\n\nTo deduce the conclusion, we need to use the following steps:\n\n1. If the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n2. If the premise is false, then the conclusion may or may not be true.\n\nIn this case, we have two premises: \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint\" and \"The smip did not lup the zoint\". We need to use these premises to deduce the conclusion \"The smip was not shripped\".\n\nTo deduce the conclusion, we need to consider the possible truth values of the premises. If the premise \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint\" is true, then the conclusion \"The smip was not shripped\" must also be true. This is because if the smip was shripped (i.e., it was stretched), then it would have lumped the zoint (i.e., it would have formed a lump with the zoint). However, we know that the smip did not form a lump with the zoint (i.e., it did not lump the zoint), so the conclusion \"The smip was not shripped\" must also be true.\n\nOn the other hand, if the premise \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint\" is false, then the conclusion \"The smip was not shripped\" may or may not be true. This is because if the smip was not shripped (i.e., it was not stretched), then it would not have lumped the zoint (i.e., it would not have formed a lump with the zoint), regardless of whether the smip did or did not form a lump with the zoint.\n\nTherefore, we can deduce the conclusion \"The smip was not shripped\" from the premises \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint\" and \"The smip did not lup the zoint\" using the rules of logic and deduction.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
