We need to use the premises to draw a conclusion.\n\nIf the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated. (Premise 1)\nThe flob did not movated. (Premise 2)\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer that the flob was not skizzled. This is because if the flob was skizzled, then it would have moved, but since it did not move, it must not have been skizzled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
