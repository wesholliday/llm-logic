            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer \"The dreb was not vroombed\" from \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spended\" together with \"The dreb was not spended\", we need to follow the rules of logical reasoning.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the meaning of the given statements. \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spended\" means that if the dreb was vroombed (i.e., it was used for a purpose), then it was also spent (i.e., it was used up). \"The dreb was not spended\" means that the dreb was not used up.\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of logical reasoning to the given statements. If the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, we need to determine whether the premises are true or not.\n\nThe first premise is \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spended\". This premise is true if the dreb was vroombed and the dreb was spended. However, the second premise is \"The dreb was not spended\". This premise is true if the dreb was not spended.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion. The conclusion is \"The dreb was not vroombed\". This conclusion is true if the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The dreb was not vroombed\" from \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spended\" together with \"The dreb was not spended\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
