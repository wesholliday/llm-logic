If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\n2. The whiffle did not tink.\n\nTo infer the conclusion, we need to use the first premise to find a connection between the whiffle being shanked and the whiffle tinking. We can do this by assuming that the whiffle was shanked and then using the first premise to deduce that the whiffle tinked.\n\nUsing this method, we can deduce that if the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked. However, we also know that the whiffle did not tink, which means that the assumption that the whiffle was shanked must be false. Therefore, we can infer that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
