            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The grommet was not sploffed\" from the premises \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" and \"The grommet did not plop the frink,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the meaning of the premises. \"If the grommet was sploffed\" means that if the grommet was damaged or harmed in some way, then the grommet would plop the frink. \"The grommet did not plop the frink\" means that the grommet did not plop the frink, even if it was damaged or harmed.\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of inference. We can use the premise \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" to infer that if the grommet was not sploffed, then it did not plop the frink. This is because if the grommet was not sploffed, then it was not damaged or harmed, and therefore it did not plop the frink.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The grommet was not sploffed\" from the premises \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" and \"The grommet did not plop the frink.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
