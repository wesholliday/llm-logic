If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n2. The sprocket was not daggled.\n\nTo infer the conclusion, we need to use the first premise to deduce the conclusion. The first premise states that if the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled. This means that if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled.\n\nHowever, the second premise states that the sprocket was not daggled. This means that if the sprocket was cranked, it must not have been daggled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
