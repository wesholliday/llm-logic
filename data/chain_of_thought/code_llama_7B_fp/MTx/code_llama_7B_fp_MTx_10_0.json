            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The wug was not sproinged\" from the premises \"If the wug was sproonged, then it was garpled\" and \"The wug was not garpled,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the meaning of the words \"sproonged\" and \"garpled.\" \"Sproonged\" means \"to spring\" or \"to leap,\" and \"garpled\" means \"to grasp\" or \"to seize.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the premises:\n\n1. If the wug was sproonged, then it was garpled.\n2. The wug was not garpled.\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer that if the wug was sproonged, then it was garpled. This means that if the wug was able to spring or leap, then it was also able to be grasped or seized.\n\nHowever, we are given the additional information that the wug was not garpled. This means that the wug was not able to be grasped or seized.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the wug was not sproonged, because if it was sproonged, then it would have been garpled. But since it was not garpled, then it must not have been sproonged.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
