If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spended.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The dreb was spended,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the meaning of the words \"vroombed\" and \"spended.\"\n\n\"Vroombed\" means to have been used or employed, and \"spended\" means to have been spent or consumed.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given premises:\n\n1. The dreb was vroombed.\n\nThis means that the dreb was used or employed at some point in the past.\n\n2. If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spended.\n\nThis means that if the dreb was used or employed, then it was also spent or consumed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the dreb was spended, since it was used or employed and therefore also spent or consumed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
