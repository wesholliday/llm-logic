If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The sprocket was daggled,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to determine whether the premises are true or false. If they are false, then the conclusion cannot be true, regardless of the rules of inference.\n\nNext, we need to determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. If the conclusion logically follows from the premises, then we can infer it.\n\nIn this case, the premises are true, and the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Therefore, we can infer that the sprocket was daggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
