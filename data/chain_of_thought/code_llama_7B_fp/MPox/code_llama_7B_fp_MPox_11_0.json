If the flight was blurred, then the flight was zimmed.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The flight was zimmed,\" we need to use logical reasoning to connect the premises.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the meaning of the words \"blurred\" and \"zimmed.\" \"Blurred\" means to make something unclear or indistinct, while \"zimmed\" means to make something clear or sharp.\n\nBased on these definitions, we can infer that \"The flight was blurred\" means that the flight was unclear or indistinct, and \"The flight was zimmed\" means that the flight was clear or sharp.\n\nNow, let's apply this understanding to the given premises. If the flight was blurred, then it means that it was unclear or indistinct. If the flight was zimmed, then it means that it was clear or sharp.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The flight was zimmed\" based on the premises \"The flight was blurred\" and \"If the flight was blurred, then the flight was zimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
