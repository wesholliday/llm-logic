The sentence \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" is a conditional statement that implies that if the grommet was damaged, then it would have plopped the frink.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the grommet plopped the frink based on the conditional statement. However, we cannot infer that the grommet plopped the frink without the context of the conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
