If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\n\nTo infer \"It was varnished,\" we need to use the syllogism form of reasoning, which involves drawing a conclusion based on two premises. The syllogism form is:\n\nAll A are B.\nAll B are C.\nTherefore, all A are C.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n1. All twonks are plinked.\n2. All plinked twonks are varnished.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that all twonks that are plinked are varnished.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
