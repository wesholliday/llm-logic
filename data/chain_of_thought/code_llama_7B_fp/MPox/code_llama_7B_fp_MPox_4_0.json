The premise 'The fribble was snurgled' is a fact.\n2. The premise 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked' is a conditional statement.\n3. The conclusion 'The fribble crinked' is also a fact.\n\nTo infer the conclusion from the premises, we need to use the rules of inference, specifically Modus Ponens, which states that if a conditional statement is true, and the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The fribble crinked' from the given premises using Modus Ponens.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
