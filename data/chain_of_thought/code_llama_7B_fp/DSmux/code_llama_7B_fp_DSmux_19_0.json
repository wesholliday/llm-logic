It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The smonk is vreebled,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the negation in the second premise. The negation is \"It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged.\" This means that the conclusion \"The smonk must be plagged\" is true.\n\nNext, we need to consider the first premise. The first premise states that either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged. This means that if the smonk is not vreebled, then it must be plagged.\n\nNow, we need to use the rules of inference to draw the conclusion. We can use the rule of excluded middle to conclude that either the smonk is vreebled or it is not vreebled. If the smonk is not vreebled, then it must be plagged, which contradicts the second premise. Therefore, we can conclude that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
