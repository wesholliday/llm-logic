It's not the case that the twonk must be plinked.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The twonk is varnished,\" we need to use logical reasoning to connect the given premises.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the twonk must be plinked. This is because the second premise states that it is not the case that the twonk must be plinked. If the twonk must be plinked, then the second premise would be false, which contradicts the first premise. Therefore, we can conclude that the twonk is not plinked.\n\nNext, we can infer that the twonk is varnished. This is because the first premise states that either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked. If the twonk is not plinked, then it must be varnished. Therefore, we can conclude that the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
