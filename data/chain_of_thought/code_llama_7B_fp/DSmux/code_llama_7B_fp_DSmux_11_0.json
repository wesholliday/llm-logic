It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The flug is blummed,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the negation in the second premise. The negation is \"It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed.\" This means that the flug must not be zimmed.\n\nNext, we need to consider the first premise. The first premise states that either the flug is blummed or it must be zimmed. This means that the flug is either blummed or it must be zimmed.\n\nNow, we need to use the negation in the second premise to infer the conclusion. If the flug must not be zimmed, then it must be blummed. Therefore, the conclusion is \"The flug is blummed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
