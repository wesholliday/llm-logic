It's not the case that the glip must be tragged.\n\nTo infer the conclusion, we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the premises and the conclusion. The premises are:\n\n1. Either the glip is slogged or it must be tragged.\n2. It's not the case that the glip must be tragged.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n3. The glip is slogged.\n\nNow, we need to apply the rules of inference to derive the conclusion from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise states that either the glip is slogged or it must be tragged.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the glip must be tragged.\n\nTo infer the conclusion, we need to use the following rule of inference:\n\nIf A or B, then C.\n\nIn this case, A is \"the glip is slogged,\" B is \"it must be tragged,\" and C is \"the glip is slogged.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer the conclusion \"The glip is slogged\" from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
