This means that if the wug is not sproinged, then it must be garpled.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the wug must be garpled. This means that if the wug is not garpled, then it must be sproinged.\n\nSince the second premise contradicts the first premise, we can conclude that the wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
