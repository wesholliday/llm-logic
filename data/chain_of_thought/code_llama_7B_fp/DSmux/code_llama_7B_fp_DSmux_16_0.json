It's not the case that the sneg must be sproted.\n\nWe need to determine whether we can infer the statement \"The sneg is cramped\" from these two statements.\n\nTo do this, we need to analyze the meaning of each statement and determine whether they are logically consistent with each other.\n\nThe first statement \"Either the sneg is cramped or it must be sproted\" means that if the sneg is not cramped, then it must be sproted. This statement is a tautology, which means that it is always true.\n\nThe second statement \"It's not the case that the sneg must be sproted\" means that the sneg must not be sproted. This statement is a contradiction, which means that it is always false.\n\nSince the two statements are logically inconsistent with each other, we cannot infer the statement \"The sneg is cramped\" from them. Therefore, the answer is no.",
