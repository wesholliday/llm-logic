It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped.\n\nWe need to determine whether we can infer the statement \"The grommet is sploffed\" from these two statements.\n\nTo do this, we need to analyze the meaning of each statement and determine whether they are logically consistent with each other.\n\nThe first statement \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped\" means that either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped. This statement is a tautology, which means that it is always true.\n\nThe second statement \"It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped\" means that it is not the case that the grommet must be plopped. This statement is a contradiction, which means that it is always false.\n\nSince the two statements are logically inconsistent with each other, we cannot infer the statement \"The grommet is sploffed\" from them. Therefore, the answer is no.",
