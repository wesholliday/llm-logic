It's not the case that the shank must be nugged.\n\nWe need to determine whether we can infer the statement \"The shank is plooked\" from these two statements.\n\nTo do this, we need to analyze the meaning of each statement and determine whether they are logically consistent with each other.\n\n1. Either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged.\n\nThis statement means that either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged. It does not necessarily mean that the shank is both plooked and nugged.\n\n2. It's not the case that the shank must be nugged.\n\nThis statement means that it is not the case that the shank must be nugged. It does not necessarily mean that the shank is plooked.\n\nNow, let's analyze the two statements together:\n\nIf the shank is plooked, then it must be nugged. Therefore, either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged.\n\nIf the shank is not plooked, then it must not be nugged. Therefore, it is not the case that the shank must be nugged.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shank is plooked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
