It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The fleeg is bluttered,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the negation in the second premise. The negation is \"It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned.\" This means that the fleeg must not be surned.\n\nNext, we need to consider the first premise. The first premise states that either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned. This means that if the fleeg is not bluttered, then it must be surned.\n\nNow, we need to combine the two premises. If the fleeg is not bluttered, then it must be surned. But we also know that the fleeg must not be surned, which means that the fleeg must be bluttered.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
