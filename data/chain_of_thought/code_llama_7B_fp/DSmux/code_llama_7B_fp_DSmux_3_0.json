It's not the case that the splat must be quanked.\n\nWe need to determine whether we can infer the statement \"The splat is morphed\" from these two statements.\n\nTo do this, we need to analyze the meaning of each statement and determine whether they are logically consistent with each other.\n\n1. Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked.\n\nThis statement means that either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked. It does not necessarily mean that the splat is both morphed and quanked.\n\n2. It's not the case that the splat must be quanked.\n\nThis statement means that it is not the case that the splat must be quanked. It does not necessarily mean that the splat is not quanked.\n\nNow, let's analyze the two statements together:\n\nIf the splat is morphed, then it must be quanked. Therefore, the statement \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked\" is logically consistent with the statement \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked\".\n\nOn the other hand, if the splat is not morphed, then it is not quanked. Therefore, the statement \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked\" is also logically consistent with the statement \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked\".\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"The splat is morphed\" from the two given statements.\n\nAnswer: No.",
