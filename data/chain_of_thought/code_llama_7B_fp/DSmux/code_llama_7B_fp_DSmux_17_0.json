It's not the case that the flob must be movated.\n\nWe need to determine whether we can infer the statement \"The flob is skizzled\" from these two statements.\n\nTo do this, we need to analyze the structure of the two statements and determine whether they are logically consistent with each other.\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction, which means that it is either the case that the flob is skizzled or it must be movated. The second statement is a negation, which means that it is not the case that the flob must be movated.\n\nIf we assume that the first statement is true, then we can infer that either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated. However, if we assume that the second statement is true, then we can infer that it is not the case that the flob must be movated.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"The flob is skizzled\" from these two statements.\n\nAnswer: No.",
