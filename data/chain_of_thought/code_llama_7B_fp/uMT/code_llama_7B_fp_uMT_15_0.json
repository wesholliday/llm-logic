Erin did not take a train.\n\nFrom the first two statements, we can infer that Sam and Erin took different modes of transportation. However, the third statement contradicts this inference. If Erin did not take a train, then it is possible that she took a plane.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Sam did not take a plane based on the given information.",
