Amy did not play tennis.\n\nWe want to infer whether Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nTo do this, we can use a process of elimination. We know that Amy did not play tennis, so if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. This means that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
