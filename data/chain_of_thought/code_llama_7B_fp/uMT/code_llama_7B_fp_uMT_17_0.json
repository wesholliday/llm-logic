Kate did not eat salad.\n\nWe want to know if we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nTo do this, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements. The first statement implies that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. This means that if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad.\n\nThe second statement says that Kate did not eat salad. This means that Kate did eat salad, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: No.",
