Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nWe want to know if we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nTo do this, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements. The first statement implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. This means that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nThe second statement says that Lucy did not go to the zoo. This means that Lucy did not go to the zoo, regardless of whether Joe went to the park or not.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
