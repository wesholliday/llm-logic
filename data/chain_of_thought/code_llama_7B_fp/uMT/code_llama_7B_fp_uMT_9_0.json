Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nFrom the first two statements, we can infer that Mark did not buy the red shirt. This is because if Mark bought the blue shirt, then he would have bought the red shirt as well, since they are the same color. However, we know that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, so he must have bought the red shirt instead.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
