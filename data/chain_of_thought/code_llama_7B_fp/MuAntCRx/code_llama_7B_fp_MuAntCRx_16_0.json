            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The grooble must snork wozzle grooble and frazzle quibble wibble' from 'The grooble must frazzle quibble wibble', we need to analyze the relationship between the two sentences. The original sentence is a simple statement that the grooble must perform two actions: frazzle quibble and wibble. The proposed inference adds a new action, snork wozzle, to the grooble's actions. However, there is no logical connection between the original sentence and the proposed inference. The addition of snork wozzle is not implied by the original sentence, and it does not follow from the information provided. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The grooble must snork wozzle grooble and frazzle quibble wibble' from 'The grooble must frazzle quibble wibble'.\n\nAnswer: no"
