Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The glip is slogged,\" we need to use logical reasoning to connect the given premises.\n\nFirst, we can negate the first premise to get \"The glip must be tragged.\" This is the contrapositive of the first premise.\n\nNext, we can use the second premise to infer that \"Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged.\" This is a tautology, which means that it is always true.\n\nNow, we can use the contrapositive of the second premise to infer that \"If the glip is not slogged, then it must be tragged.\" This is the negation of the second premise.\n\nFinally, we can use the first premise to infer that \"The glip must be tragged.\" This is the contrapositive of the first premise.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The glip is slogged\" based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
