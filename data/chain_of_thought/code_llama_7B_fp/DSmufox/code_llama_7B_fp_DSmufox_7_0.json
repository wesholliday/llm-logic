If the whiffle must be tinked, then the first premise would be false, and we would not be able to infer that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nNext, we can use the second premise to infer that the whiffle is either tinked or shanked. If the whiffle is tinked, then the second premise would be true, and we would be able to infer that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
