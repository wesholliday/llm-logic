Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The sprocket is cranked,\" we need to use logical reasoning to connect the given premises.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the sprocket must be daggled, since the first premise states that it is not the case that the sprocket must be daggled. This means that the sprocket is not necessarily daggled, and we can proceed to the next premise.\n\nSecond, we can infer that the sprocket must be cranked, since the second premise states that either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked. This means that if the sprocket is not daggled, it must be cranked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sprocket is cranked, based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
