The first statement asserts that the negation of the premise is true, while the second statement asserts that either the premise is true or the conclusion is true.\n\nIf we assume that the first statement is true, then the negation of the premise is false, which means that the premise is true. Therefore, the second statement asserts that either the premise is true or the conclusion is true, which implies that the conclusion is true.\n\nOn the other hand, if we assume that the second statement is true, then either the premise is true or the conclusion is true. If the premise is true, then the first statement asserts that the negation of the premise is false, which means that the premise is false. This contradicts the assumption that the second statement is true. Therefore, the assumption that the second statement is true leads to a logical contradiction.\n\nIn conclusion, we cannot infer the statement \"The smonk is vreebled\" from the given statements. The first statement asserts that the negation of the premise is true, while the second statement asserts that either the premise is true or the conclusion is true. These two statements are inconsistent with each other, which means that we cannot infer the conclusion from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
