The first premise asserts that the negation of the condition \"the fleeg must be surned\" is true.\n2. The second premise asserts that either the condition \"the fleeg must be surned\" or the condition \"the fleeg is bluttered\" is true.\n\nNow, we can apply the rules of logical inference to determine whether we can infer the conclusion \"The fleeg is bluttered\" from the premises.\n\n1. The conclusion \"The fleeg is bluttered\" is a statement that asserts that the condition \"the fleeg is bluttered\" is true.\n2. The premises \"It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned\" and \"Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered\" are both statements that asserts that either the condition \"the fleeg must be surned\" or the condition \"the fleeg is bluttered\" is true.\n\nBased on the above, we can infer the conclusion \"The fleeg is bluttered\" from the premises \"It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned\" and \"Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered\" using the rules of logical inference.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
