The first premise states that it is not the case that the splat must be quanked, which means that the quanking of the splat is not necessary. The second premise states that either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed, which means that if the quanking of the splat is not necessary, then it must be morphed. Therefore, we can infer that the splat is morphed based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
