'It's not the case that the clug must be snugged' means that the clug is not required to be snugged. 'Either the clug must be snugged or it is fleeked' means that either the clug must be snugged or it is fleeked.\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of logical reasoning to the given premises. We need to use the principle of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time.\n\nIf we assume that 'The clug is fleeked', then we have a contradiction. If the clug is fleeked, then it must be snugged, but we know that it is not required to be snugged. Therefore, we can conclude that 'The clug is not fleeked'.\n\nOn the other hand, if we assume that 'The clug is not fleeked', then we have a contradiction. If the clug is not fleeked, then it must be snugged, but we know that it is not required to be snugged. Therefore, we can conclude that 'The clug is fleeked'.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The clug is fleeked' from 'It's not the case that the clug must be snugged' together with 'Either the clug must be snugged or it is fleeked'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
