Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The grommet is sploffed,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to negate the first premise to get the contrapositive: \"The grommet must be plopped.\"\n\nNext, we need to use the second premise to eliminate the possibility that the grommet must be plopped. If the grommet must be plopped, then it cannot be sploffed. Therefore, we can conclude that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
