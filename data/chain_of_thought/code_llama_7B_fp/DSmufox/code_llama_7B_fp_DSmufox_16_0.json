If the sneg is sproted, then it is crampled, so we can conclude that the sneg is crampled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the conclusion \"The sneg is crampled\" from the premises \"It's not the case that the sneg must be sproted\" and \"Either the sneg must be sproted or it is crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
