If the wug is bimmed, then it is not flooped, so we can conclude that \"The wug is not flooped.\"\n\nThird, we need to use the negation of the first premise to eliminate the possibility that the wug is not flooped. If the wug is not flooped, then it must be bimmed, so we can conclude that \"The wug is flooped.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer the conclusion \"The wug is flooped\" from the premises \"It's not the case that the wug must be bimmed\" and \"Either the wug must be bimmed or it is flooped.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
