This means that the flug is not zimmed, which means that it is blummed.\n\nSecond, we can use the second premise to infer that either the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed. This means that if the flug is not zimmed, then it must be blummed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
