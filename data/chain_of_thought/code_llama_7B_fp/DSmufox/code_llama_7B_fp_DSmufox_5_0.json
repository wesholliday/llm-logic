This means that the zinger is not smoogled, which implies that it is fraggled.\n\nSecond, we can infer that the zinger is fraggled by the second statement. This statement states that either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled. Since we have already determined that the zinger is not smoogled, the only possibility left is that it is fraggled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The zinger is fraggled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
