Either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The shank is plooked,\" we need to use logical reasoning to connect the given premises.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the shank must be nugged, since the first premise states that it is not the case that the shank must be nugged. This means that the shank is not required to be nugged, and we can infer that it is not nugged.\n\nSecond, we can use the second premise to infer that either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked. This means that if the shank is not nugged, it must be plooked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shank is plooked, based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
