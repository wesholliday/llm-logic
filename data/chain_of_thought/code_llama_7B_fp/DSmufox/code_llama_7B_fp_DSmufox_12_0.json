This is because if \"It's not the case that the smip must be lupped\" were true, then \"Either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped\" would also be false, since \"It's not the case that the smip must be lupped\" implies that \"the smip must not be lupped\".\n\nNext, we can deduce that \"Either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped\" is true. This is because if \"Either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped\" were false, then \"It's not the case that the smip must be lupped\" would also be false, since \"Either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped\" implies that \"the smip must be lupped\" or \"the smip must be shripped\".\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The smip is shripped\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
