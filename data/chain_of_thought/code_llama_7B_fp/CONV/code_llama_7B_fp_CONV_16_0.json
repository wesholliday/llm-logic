If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n2. The shirt was cotton.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n3. The pants were denim.\n\nHowever, this conclusion is not necessarily true, as the premise \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" does not necessarily imply that the pants were denim if the shirt was not cotton.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton\" based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
