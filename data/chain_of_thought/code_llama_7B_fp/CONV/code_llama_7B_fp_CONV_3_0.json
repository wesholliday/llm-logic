            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is a conditional statement that implies a causal relationship between the two conditions. In other words, if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James.\" This statement is also a conditional statement, but it is a different type of conditional statement. It is a material conditional, which means that it is a statement about the possibility of one event (the book being a mystery novel) given the possibility of another event (the book being written by James).\n\nTo determine whether we can infer the second statement from the first statement, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements. The first statement implies that the book is a mystery novel if it was written by James, while the second statement implies that the book was written by James if it is a mystery novel.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer the second statement from the first statement. However, we need to be careful not to draw an incorrect conclusion. If the book was not written by James, then the first statement does not necessarily imply that it is a mystery novel. Therefore, we need to be cautious when using this type of reasoning.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
