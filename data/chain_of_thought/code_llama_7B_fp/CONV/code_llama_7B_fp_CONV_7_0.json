In this case, the original statement is \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" The converse of this statement would be \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\"\n\nHowever, we cannot infer the converse of the original statement from the given information. The fact that Alex finished the race does not necessarily mean that Chris finished the race, as there may be other factors that influenced Chris's performance. Therefore, we cannot make a conclusion about Chris's race performance based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No.",
