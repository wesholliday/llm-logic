This means that if the mummy is awake, then the vampire must also be awake.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that if the mummy is not awake, then the vampire is not awake. The mummy's state of being awake could be independent of the vampire's state of being awake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake\" based solely on the fact that \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
