            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis is a classic example of a logical fallacy known as a \"modus ponens\" or \"hypothetical syllogism.\" The fallacy lies in the assumption that because the premise \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is true, we can infer that the conclusion \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\" is also true.\n\nHowever, this is not necessarily the case. The premise \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" does not necessarily imply that Sue was at the wedding, as there may be other factors that led to Sue's absence. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\" is true.\n\nAnswer: No.",
