If the bear was in the case, then the wolf was in the den.\n2. The wolf was in the den.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n3. The bear was in the case.\n\nHowever, this conclusion is not logically implied by the premises. The first premise only implies that if the bear was in the case, then the wolf was in the den. It does not imply that the wolf was in the den, or that the bear was in the case. Therefore, the conclusion is not a logical inference from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
