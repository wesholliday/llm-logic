However, this does not necessarily mean that the conclusion implies the premise.\n\nFor example, if the griffin was in the forest and the unicorn was not, then the statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" is still true, but it does not imply that the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was in the forest\" from \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\".",
