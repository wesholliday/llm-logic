            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The computer might be working or broken' from 'The computer might be broken', let's break down the meaning of the original statement. 'The computer might be broken' implies that there is a possibility that the computer is in a state of being broken, but it does not exclude the possibility that the computer is actually working. The word 'might' introduces a degree of uncertainty, suggesting that the computer's state is not certain. Therefore, the original statement does not rule out the possibility that the computer is working.\n\nAnswer: yes"
