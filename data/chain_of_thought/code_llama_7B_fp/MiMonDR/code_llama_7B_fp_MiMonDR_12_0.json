However, it does not rule out the possibility that the food might not be spicy. In fact, it explicitly leaves open the possibility that the food might be spicy, but it does not exclude the possibility that it might be mild. Therefore, we can infer that the food might be mild or spicy.\n\nAnswer: yes"
