In this case, the antecedent is \"the book was written by James.\"\n\nThe statement \"The book is a mystery novel\" is an independent statement, which means that it is true regardless of whether the antecedent is true or not.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the statement \"The book was written by James\" is not necessarily true, even if the book is a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: No.",
