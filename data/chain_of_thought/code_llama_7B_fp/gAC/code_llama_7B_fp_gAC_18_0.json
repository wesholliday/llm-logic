Therefore, if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true, and the conditional statement is true.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether the antecedent is true or not. The antecedent is \"the doll was plastic.\" We are not given any information about the doll, so we cannot determine whether it was plastic or not. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the antecedent is true or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot determine whether \"The doll was plastic\" is true or not, and we cannot determine whether \"The doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is true or not.\n\nAnswer: No.",
