In this case, the antecedent is \"the apple was red\" and the consequent is \"the banana was yellow\".\n\nThe statement \"The banana was yellow\" is also true, so the conditional statement is also true.\n\nTherefore, it does not follow that \"The apple was red\" is true. The conditional statement is only true if the antecedent is true and the consequent is true, and the antecedent is true, but the consequent is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: No.",
