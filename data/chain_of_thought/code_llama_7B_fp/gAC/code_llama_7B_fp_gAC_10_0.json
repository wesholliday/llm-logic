If both of these statements are true, then the conditional statement is also true.\n\nThe statement \"The cat was outside\" is a separate statement that is not related to the conditional statement. It is not necessary for the conditional statement to be true in order for this statement to be true.\n\nTherefore, it does not follow that \"The dog was inside\" is true just because \"The cat was outside\" is true. The conditional statement must be true in order for the conclusion to be true.",
