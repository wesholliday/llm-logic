Therefore, if the second premise is true, we can conclude that the first premise is also true.\n\nHowever, if the second premise is false, then the first premise may be false as well. In this case, we cannot conclude that the first premise is true.\n\nTherefore, we need to evaluate the validity of the second premise. If the second premise is true, then the first premise is also true. If the second premise is false, then the first premise may be false as well.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo.",
