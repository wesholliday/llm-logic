In this case, the condition is \"Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe statement \"Sue was at the wedding\" is a separate statement that is not necessarily related to the condition \"Mary was at the wedding.\" However, if \"Sue was at the wedding\" is true, then it is also true that \"Mary was at the wedding,\" because \"Sue was at the wedding\" implies that \"Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\nTherefore, if \"Sue was at the wedding\" is true and \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true, then it follows that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
