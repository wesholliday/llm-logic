'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' is true:\nThis statement is a conditional statement, and it is true because the antecedent (the part before the 'then') is true and the consequent (the part after the 'then') is true.\n2. 'Erin took a train' is true:\nThis statement is a simple statement, and it is true because Erin did indeed take a train.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the conditional statement 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' and the statement 'Erin took a train' separately:\n\n1. Evaluating the conditional statement 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train':\nThe antecedent of this statement is 'Sam took a plane', and the consequent is 'Erin took a train'. Since the antecedent is true (Sam did indeed take a plane), the conditional statement is also true.\n2. Evaluating the statement 'Erin took a train':\nThis statement is true because Erin did indeed take a train.\n\nNow, let's see if the conditional statement 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' implies that 'Sam took a plane' is true:\n\nIf the conditional statement 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' is true, and the statement 'Erin took a train' is true, then it follows that 'Sam took a plane' is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
