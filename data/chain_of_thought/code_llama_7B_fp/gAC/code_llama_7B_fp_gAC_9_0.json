This statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is true if the condition is met and the conclusion is true. In this case, the condition is 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and the conclusion is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n\nThe second statement is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'. This statement is also true.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether the first statement is true or not. If the first statement is true, then the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, we need to determine whether the condition is met.\n\nThe condition is 'Lisa bought the red shirt'. We know that this statement is true, since we have been given that information. Therefore, the condition is met.\n\nSince the condition is met and the conclusion is true, we can conclude that the first statement is true. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
