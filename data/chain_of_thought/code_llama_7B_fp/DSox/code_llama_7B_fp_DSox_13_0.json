This means that the glip is either slogged or tragged.\n\nSecond, we can infer that the glip is slogged by the second statement. This means that either the glip is slogged or it is tragged. Since we have already eliminated the possibility that the glip is not tragged, we can conclude that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
