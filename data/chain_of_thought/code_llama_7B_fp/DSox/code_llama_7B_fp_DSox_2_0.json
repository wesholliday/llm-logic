This means that the wug must be flooped.\n\nSecond, we can use the second premise to further support our inference. The second premise states that either the wug is flooped or it is bimmed. Since we have already determined that the wug is not bimmed, the only remaining possibility is that it is flooped.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the wug is flooped based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
