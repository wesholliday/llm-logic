This means that the flob is not movated, and we can assume that it is not skizzled.\n\nSecond, we can use the second statement to infer that either the flob is skizzled or it is movated. This means that if the flob is not movated, then it must be skizzled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
