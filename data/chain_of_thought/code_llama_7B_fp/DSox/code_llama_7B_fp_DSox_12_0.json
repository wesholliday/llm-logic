This means that the smip is not lupped, and we can assume that it is not lupped for the purpose of our inference.\n\nNext, we can use the second statement to infer that either the smip is shripped or it is lupped. This means that we have two possible options: either the smip is shripped, or it is lupped.\n\nSince we have already eliminated the possibility that the smip is lupped, the only remaining option is that the smip is shripped. Therefore, we can infer that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
