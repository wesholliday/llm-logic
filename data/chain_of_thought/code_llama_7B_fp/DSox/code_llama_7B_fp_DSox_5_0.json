This means that the zinger is not smoogled.\n\nSecond, we can infer that the zinger is fraggled by the second statement. This means that either the zinger is fraggled or it is smoogled. Since we have already determined that the zinger is not smoogled, we can infer that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
