'The fleeg is not surned' means that the fleeg is not surned, which means that it is not surged. 'Either the fleeg is bluttered or it is surned' means that either the fleeg is bluttered or it is surned, which means that it is either bluttered or surged.\n\nNow, let's apply the principles of deduction to the given statements. If the fleeg is not surned, then it is not surged. Therefore, if the fleeg is not surned, it is bluttered.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The fleeg is bluttered' from 'The fleeg is not surned' together with 'Either the fleeg is bluttered or it is surned'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
