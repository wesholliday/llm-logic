This means that the splat is not quanked, which implies that it is not morphed.\n\nSecond, we can infer that the splat is morphed by the second statement. This statement implies that either the splat is morphed or it is quanked. Since we have already determined that the splat is not quanked, we can conclude that the splat must be morphed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the splat is morphed based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
