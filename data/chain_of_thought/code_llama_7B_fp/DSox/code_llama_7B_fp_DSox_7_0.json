This means that the whiffle is tinked.\n\nNext, we can use the given information 'Either the whiffle is shanked or it is tinked' to infer that the whiffle is shanked. This is because if the whiffle is tinked, then it is not shanked, and if the whiffle is shanked, then it is tinked. Therefore, if the whiffle is tinked, then it is shanked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The whiffle is shanked' from 'The whiffle is not tinked' together with 'Either the whiffle is shanked or it is tinked'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
