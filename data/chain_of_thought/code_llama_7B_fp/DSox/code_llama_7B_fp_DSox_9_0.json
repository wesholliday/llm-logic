This means that the twonk is not plinked, which implies that it is not varnished.\n\nSecond, we can infer that the twonk is varnished by the second statement. This statement implies that either the twonk is varnished or it is plinked. Since we have already determined that the twonk is not plinked, we can conclude that the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
