Therefore, we can conclude that the fribble is not crinked.\n\nSecond, we can infer that the fribble is either snurgled or it is not snurgled, based on the second statement.\n\nThird, we can use the law of excluded middle to conclude that the fribble is snurgled. This law states that every statement is either true or false, and that there is no middle ground. Therefore, if the fribble is not crinked, and it is either snurgled or it is not snurgled, then it must be snurgled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
