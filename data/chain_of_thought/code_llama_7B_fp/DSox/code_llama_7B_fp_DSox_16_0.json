If the sneg is sproted, then it cannot be crampled, as the two words have different meanings. Therefore, we can conclude that the sneg is not sproted.\n\nNext, we can use the second statement to infer that the sneg is either crampled or sproted. If the sneg is crampled, then it cannot be sproted, as the two words have different meanings. Therefore, we can conclude that the sneg is crampled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
