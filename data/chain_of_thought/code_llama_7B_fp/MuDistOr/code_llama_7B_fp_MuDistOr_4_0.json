            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a compound sentence with a disjunctive conjunction \"or\", which means it presents two alternatives that are mutually exclusive. The statement implies that the keys were either in the drawer or on the hook, but not both. The original statement is structured as \"A or B\", where A is \"the keys must have been in the drawer\" and B is \"the keys must have been on the hook\". The inference we are asked to make is \"A or B\", which is the same as the original statement. This is a tautology, as the original statement and the inference are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: yes"
