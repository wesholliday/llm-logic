The statement \"The flight must have been delayed or it must have been cancelled\" is a more specific and logically equivalent statement that conveys the same information. However, the original statement does not logically imply the second statement, because it does not rule out the possibility that the flight was both delayed and cancelled.\n\nAnswer: no"
