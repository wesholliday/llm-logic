This means that both clauses can stand alone as separate sentences. However, the word \"or\" in this context is not an exclusive \"or\", but an inclusive \"or\", which means that both conditions can be true at the same time. Therefore, we can infer that the candidate must have had a degree and also must have had relevant work experience.\n\nAnswer: no"
