The word \"or\" is used to connect the two options, indicating that the exam must have been either multiple choice or essay-based, but not necessarily both. This is an \"inclusive or,\" where both options are possible. Therefore, we can infer that the exam must have been multiple choice or it must have been essay-based, as the two options are presented as mutually exclusive alternatives.\n\nAnswer: yes"
