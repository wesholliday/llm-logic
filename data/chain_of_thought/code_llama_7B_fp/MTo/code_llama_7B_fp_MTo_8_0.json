If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The vampire was not awake,\" we need to use logical reasoning to draw a conclusion from the given premises.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the mummy was awake by using the premise \"The mummy was not awake.\" This means that the mummy was in a state of sleep or unconsciousness.\n\nNext, we can use the premise \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" to infer that the vampire was not awake. This is because if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would also be awake, but we know that the mummy was not awake. Therefore, we can conclude that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
