If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n\nTo infer the conclusion, we need to use logical reasoning. We can start by considering the first premise, \"The truck was not blue.\" This means that the truck is not blue, and we can assume that it is some other color.\n\nNext, we consider the second premise, \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This means that if the car is red, then the truck is blue. We can assume that the car is not red, since we have already established that the truck is not blue.\n\nNow, we can infer the conclusion, \"The car was not red.\" This is because if the car was red, then the truck would be blue, but since the truck is not blue, the car must not be red.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
