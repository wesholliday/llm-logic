            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given two statements:\n\n1. Jen did not watch basketball.\n2. If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n\nWe need to determine whether we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nTo do this, we need to use the conditional statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This statement implies that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n\nNow, let's consider the first statement: Jen did not watch basketball. This statement does not directly contradict the conditional statement, but it does provide some information. If Jen did not watch basketball, then it is possible that Tom did not watch football either.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer that Tom did not watch football based solely on the first statement. We need to consider the conditional statement as well. If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Tom did not watch football based on the first statement alone. We need to consider both statements together to make a conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No.",
