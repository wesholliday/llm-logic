If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then it is likely that she did not go to the park either. The statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. Therefore, if we know that Lucy did not go to the zoo, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
