If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The doll was not plastic,\" we need to use logical reasoning.\n\nStep 1: We know that the truck was not metal, so we can conclude that the truck was not plastic.\n\nStep 2: We also know that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. Therefore, if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nStep 3: We can infer that the doll was not plastic, because if the doll was plastic, then the truck would have been metal. However, we know that the truck was not metal, so the doll must not have been plastic.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
