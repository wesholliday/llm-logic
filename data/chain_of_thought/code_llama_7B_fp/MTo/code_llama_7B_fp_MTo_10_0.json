If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The dog was inside,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the cat was outside by using the first premise. If the cat was outside, then the second premise would not hold, since the cat was not outside. Therefore, we can conclude that the cat was not outside.\n\nNext, we can use the second premise to infer that the dog was inside if it was inside, then the cat was outside. This means that the dog was inside if the cat was outside.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the dog was inside based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
