If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nWe need to determine whether we can infer that Alex did not finish the race based on these two statements.\n\nTo do this, we need to analyze the statements and determine whether they are logically consistent with each other.\n\nIf Chris did not finish the race, then it is possible that Alex did finish the race. However, if Alex did finish the race, then Chris must have finished the race as well, since the statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is a conditional statement that implies that if a condition is true, then a certain conclusion must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Alex did not finish the race based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No.",
