If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nTo infer whether the apple was red or not, we need to analyze the given statements and their logical relationships.\n\nFirstly, we can see that the first statement is a fact, which means that the banana was not yellow.\n\nSecondly, we can see that the second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible combinations of the given statements:\n\n1. The banana was not yellow and the apple was red: This combination is not possible, as the first statement states that the banana was not yellow, and the second statement states that the banana was yellow if the apple was red.\n2. The banana was not yellow and the apple was not red: This combination is also not possible, as the first statement states that the banana was not yellow, and the second statement states that the banana was yellow if the apple was red.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
