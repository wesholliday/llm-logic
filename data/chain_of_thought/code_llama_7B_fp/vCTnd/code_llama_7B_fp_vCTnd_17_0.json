The premise is a conditional statement, \"If the customer was greeted, then they were not greeted warmly,\" which is not necessarily true. It is possible that the customer was greeted warmly, but not necessarily not greeted warmly.\n\nThe conclusion, \"If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted,\" is also a conditional statement, but it is not necessarily true. It is possible that the customer was greeted warmly, but not necessarily not greeted.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because it does not follow from the premise to the conclusion.",
