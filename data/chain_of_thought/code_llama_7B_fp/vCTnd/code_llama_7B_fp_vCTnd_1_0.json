Therefore, the conclusion \"If it's raining hard, then it's not raining\" is also always true, regardless of the actual weather conditions.\n\nHowever, this argument is not a contradiction, which means that it is not necessarily false. Therefore, it is not necessarily logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
