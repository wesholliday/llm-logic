The premise of the argument is a conditional statement, \"If the room was tidied, then it was not tidied thoroughly.\" This statement is not necessarily true, as it is possible for a room to be tidied without being tidied thoroughly.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is also a conditional statement, \"If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied.\" This statement is also not necessarily true, as it is possible for a room to be tidied thoroughly without being tidied at all.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because it is based on a false premise.",
