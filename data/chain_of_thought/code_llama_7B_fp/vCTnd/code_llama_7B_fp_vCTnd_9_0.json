The premise of the argument is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the conditions outlined in the premise are met. In this case, the premise states that if instructions were given, then they were not explained clearly. However, the conclusion of the argument states that if instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given. This means that the conclusion is not necessarily true, as the premise does not necessarily imply the conclusion.\n\nFor example, imagine that a person was given instructions to do something, but the instructions were unclear and confusing. In this case, the premise would be true, as instructions were given, but the conclusion would not be true, as the instructions were not explained clearly. Therefore, this argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
