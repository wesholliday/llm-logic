The premise \"If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice\" is not necessarily true. There may be cases where advice was offered, but it was helpful and useful. Therefore, the conclusion \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered\" is not necessarily true either.\n\nAnswer: No.",
