The premise of the argument is a conditional statement, \"If the clothes were washed, then they were not washed properly.\" This statement is not necessarily true, as it is possible for the clothes to have been washed properly without being washed improperly.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is also a conditional statement, \"If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed.\" This statement is also not necessarily true, as it is possible for the clothes to have been washed properly and still not have been washed.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because it does not follow from the premise to the conclusion.",
