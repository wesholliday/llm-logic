The premise states that if Alex exercises, then he did not exercise much, but the conclusion states that if Alex exercises much, then he did not exercise. This is a contradiction, as it is possible for Alex to exercise much without exercising at all. Therefore, this argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
