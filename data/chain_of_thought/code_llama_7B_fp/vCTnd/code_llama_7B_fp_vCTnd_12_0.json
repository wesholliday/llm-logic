The premise states that if Jane studied, then she did not study long, but the conclusion states that if Jane studied long, then she did not study. This is a contradiction, as it implies that if Jane studied long, then she did not study, but if she did not study, then she did not study long. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
