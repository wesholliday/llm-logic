            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis argument is not logically valid. The premise \"If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth\" is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the \"if\") is true and the consequent (the part after the \"if\") is false. In this case, the antecedent is \"If the issue was discussed,\" which is a statement about the issue being discussed, and the consequent is \"it was not discussed in depth,\" which is a statement about the issue being discussed in depth.\n\nThe conclusion \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed\" is also a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the \"if\") is true and the consequent (the part after the \"if\") is false. In this case, the antecedent is \"If the issue was discussed in depth,\" which is a statement about the issue being discussed in depth, and the consequent is \"it was not discussed,\" which is a statement about the issue not being discussed.\n\nThe problem with this argument is that the premise and conclusion are both conditional statements, but they are not logically equivalent. The premise is a conditional statement that says \"If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth,\" which is a statement about the issue being discussed and not being discussed in depth. The conclusion is a conditional statement that says \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed,\" which is a statement about the issue being discussed in depth and not being discussed.\n\nThese two statements are not logically equivalent, because the premise is saying that if the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth, while the conclusion is saying that if the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed. These two statements are contradictory, because they are saying opposite things about what happens if the issue is discussed.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid.",
