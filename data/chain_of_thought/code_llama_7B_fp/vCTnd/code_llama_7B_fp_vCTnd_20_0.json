The premise \"If a recommendation was made, then it was not a strong recommendation\" is not necessarily true. A recommendation can be made without being a strong recommendation, and a strong recommendation can be made without being a recommendation at all. Therefore, the conclusion \"If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made\" is not necessarily true either.\n\nAnswer: No.",
