The premise states that if you water the plants, they will grow, but the conclusion states that if you water the plants and there is no sunlight, they will still grow. This is a conditional statement, and it is not necessarily true that if you water the plants and there is no sunlight, they will still grow.\n\nAnswer: No.",
