The premise states that if you fertilize the lawn, it will be lush and green. The conclusion states that if you fertilize the lawn and there is a drought, it will be lush and green. This is a conditional statement, and it is not necessarily true that if you fertilize the lawn and there is a drought, it will be lush and green.\n\nFor example, suppose it is a hot summer day and there is a drought. If you fertilize the lawn, it may not be lush and green, even if it was previously not lush and green. In this case, the conclusion would not logically follow from the premise.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid.",
