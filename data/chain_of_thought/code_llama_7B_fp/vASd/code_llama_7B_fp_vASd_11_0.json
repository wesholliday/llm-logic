The premise states that if you get enough sleep, you won't be tired, but the conclusion states that if you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired. This is a conditional statement, and it is not necessarily true that if you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired.\n\nFor example, if you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you may still be tired because you may have to work for a long time or you may have to work in a physically demanding job. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
