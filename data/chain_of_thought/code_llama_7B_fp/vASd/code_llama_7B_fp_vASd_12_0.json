The premise states that if I finish my homework, I can play video games. However, the conclusion states that if I finish my homework and my computer catches on fire, I can play video games. This is a conditional statement, and it is not necessarily true that if my computer catches on fire, I will be able to play video games.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.",
