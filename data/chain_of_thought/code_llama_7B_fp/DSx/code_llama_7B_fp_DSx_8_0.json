Either the sprocket is cranked or it is daggled.\n2. The sprocket is not daggled.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that the sprocket is cranked. This is because the first statement implies that the sprocket is either cranked or daggled, and the second statement contradicts the possibility that the sprocket is daggled. Therefore, the only possible conclusion is that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
