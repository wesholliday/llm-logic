Either the whiffle is shanked or it is tinked.\n2. The whiffle is not tinked.\n\nTo infer the conclusion, we need to use the first premise to eliminate the possibility that the whiffle is tinked. If the whiffle is tinked, then it cannot be shanked, so we can eliminate that possibility. Therefore, the only possibility left is that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
