Either the zinger is fraggled or it is smoogled.\n2. The zinger is not smoogled.\n\nTo infer the conclusion, we need to use the first premise to eliminate the possibility that the zinger is smoogled. If the zinger is smoogled, then it cannot be fraggled, since the two terms are mutually exclusive. Therefore, if the zinger is not smoogled, it must be fraggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
