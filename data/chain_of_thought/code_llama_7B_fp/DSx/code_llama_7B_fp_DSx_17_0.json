This is because if the flob is movated, then it is not skizzled, since \"Either the flob is skizzled or it is movated\" implies that the flob is either skizzled or movated, but not both. Therefore, if the flob is not movated, then it must be skizzled.\n\nNext, we can deduce that \"The flob is skizzled\" from the premise \"Either the flob is skizzled or it is movated.\" This is because if the flob is skizzled, then it is either skizzled or movated, but not both. Therefore, if the flob is skizzled, then it must be either skizzled or movated.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The flob is skizzled\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
