Either the flugel is blimmed or it is zargled.\n2. The flugel is not zargled.\n\nTo infer the conclusion, we need to use the first premise to eliminate the possibility that the flugel is zargled. If the flugel is zargled, then it cannot be blimmed, since the two statements are mutually exclusive. Therefore, if the flugel is not zargled, it must be blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
