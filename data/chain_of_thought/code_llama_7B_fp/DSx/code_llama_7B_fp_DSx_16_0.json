The second premise \"The sneg is not sproted\" means that the sneg is not stretched.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible combinations of the two premises:\n\n1. The sneg is cramped: In this case, the sneg is not stretched, which means that the second premise is true. Therefore, we can infer that the sneg is cramped.\n2. The sneg is stretched: In this case, the sneg is not cramped, which means that the first premise is true. Therefore, we can infer that the sneg is stretched.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can infer that the sneg is cramped.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
