Either the fribble is snurgled or it is crinked.\n2. The fribble is not crinked.\n\nTo infer the conclusion, we need to use the first premise to eliminate the possibility that the fribble is crinked. If the fribble is crinked, then it cannot be snurgled, so the first premise is false. Therefore, we can conclude that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
