This means that the possibility of the clug not being fleeked exists.\n\nNow, if we want to infer that it is not the case that the clug must have been fleeked, we need to consider the opposite of the sentence \"The clug might not have been fleeked\". This would be \"The clug must have been fleeked\".\n\nTherefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the clug must have been fleeked, which means that it is possible that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
