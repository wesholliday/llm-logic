This implies that it is not certain that the grommet was sploffed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the grommet must have been sploffed. This is equivalent to saying that it is possible that the grommet was not sploffed, which is the opposite of what the original sentence states.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
