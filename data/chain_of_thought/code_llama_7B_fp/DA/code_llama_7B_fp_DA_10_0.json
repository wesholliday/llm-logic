'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside' means that if the dog was in the house, then the cat was outside the house. 'The dog was not inside' means that the dog was not in the house.\n\nNow, let's apply the logical reasoning. If the dog was not inside, then it is possible that the cat was outside. However, if the dog was inside, then it is not possible that the cat was outside.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The cat was not outside' if the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
