The first premise states that if the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. This premise is logically consistent because it is a conditional statement, and the antecedent (if the book was written by James) is true, and the consequent (the book is a mystery novel) is true.\n\nThe second premise states that the book was not written by James. This premise is also logically consistent because it is a simple statement that is not dependent on any other premises.\n\nNow, we can apply the rules of logical inference to determine whether we can infer the conclusion \"The book is not a mystery novel\" from the premises. The rule of inference we need to use is called Modus Tollens, which states that if the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, then the consequent is true.\n\nIn this case, the antecedent of the conditional statement is \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\", and the consequent is \"The book is not a mystery novel\". Since the antecedent is false (the book was not written by James), we can infer that the consequent is true (the book is not a mystery novel).\n\nTherefore, we can infer the conclusion \"The book is not a mystery novel\" from the premises \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" and \"The book was not written by James\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
