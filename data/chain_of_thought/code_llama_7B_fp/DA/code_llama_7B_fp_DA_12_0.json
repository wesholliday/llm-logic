Joe did not go to the park.\n\nTo infer whether Lucy did not go to the zoo, we need to analyze the given statements and their logical relationships.\n\nFirstly, we need to understand the meaning of the given statements. The first statement means that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. This implies that Lucy went to the zoo only if Joe went to the park.\n\nThe second statement means that Joe did not go to the park. This means that Joe did not go to the park, which means that Lucy did not go to the zoo either.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
