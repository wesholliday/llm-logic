If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n2. Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that Mark bought the blue shirt. However, the second statement contradicts this inference. If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then it is possible that she did not buy the blue shirt either. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: No.",
