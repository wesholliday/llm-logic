The first premise states that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is also in the forest. This means that if the griffin is not in the forest, then the unicorn is not in the forest.\n\nThe second premise states that the griffin is not in the forest. This means that the griffin is not in the forest, and therefore the unicorn is not in the forest.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
