'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' means that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would also be awake. 'The vampire was not awake' means that the vampire was not awake.\n\nNow, let's apply the premises to the conclusion. If the vampire was not awake, then it is possible that the mummy was not awake. However, if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would also be awake. Therefore, we can infer that the mummy was not awake if the vampire was not awake, but we cannot infer that the mummy was not awake if the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: No.",
