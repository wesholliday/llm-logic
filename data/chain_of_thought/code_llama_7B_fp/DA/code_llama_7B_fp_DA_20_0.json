The apple was not red.\n\nTo infer the conclusion that the banana was not yellow, we need to use logical reasoning. The first premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. This means that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\n\nThe second premise states that the apple was not red. This contradicts the first premise, as the first premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. Therefore, we can infer that the banana was not yellow.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
