Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nTo infer whether Sue was at the wedding or not, we need to analyze the given statements and their logical relationships.\n\nFirstly, we need to understand the meaning of the given statements. The first statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" means that if Mary was present at the wedding, then it is likely that Sue was also present at the wedding. The second statement \"Mary was not at the wedding\" means that Mary was not present at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements together:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n2. Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that Sue was not at the wedding. This is because if Mary was not at the wedding, then it is unlikely that Sue was also present at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
