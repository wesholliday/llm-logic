The car was not red.\n\nTo infer the conclusion, we need to use logical reasoning. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the premise (the car was red) is true, then the conclusion (the truck was blue) must also be true. The second statement is a negative statement, which means that the car was not red.\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of inference to arrive at the conclusion.\n\n1. If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n2. The car was not red.\n\nWe can infer the conclusion by using the following steps:\n\n1. If the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n2. The premise is false, so the conclusion cannot be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the truck was not blue.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
