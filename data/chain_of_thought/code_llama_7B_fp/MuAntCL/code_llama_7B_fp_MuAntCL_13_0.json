            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The movie must have been in English\" implies that the movie was spoken in the English language, but it does not necessarily mean that it had subtitles. The presence of subtitles is not a requirement for a movie to be in English. Many English-language movies do not have subtitles, as they are intended for native English speakers or those who understand the language. Therefore, we cannot infer that the movie must have had subtitles based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
