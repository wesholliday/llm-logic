            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The document must have been signed' implies that the document has undergone a basic level of authentication, which is the act of signing. However, it does not necessarily imply that the document has been notarized, which is a separate process that involves verifying the identity of the signer and witnessing the signing. Notarization is an additional step that can be taken after a document has been signed, but it is not a requirement for a document to be considered signed. Therefore, we cannot infer that the document must have been signed and notarized based solely on the statement 'The document must have been signed'.\n\nAnswer: no"
