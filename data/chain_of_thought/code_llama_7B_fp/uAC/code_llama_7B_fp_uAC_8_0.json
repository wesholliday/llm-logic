This means that if the vampire is awake, then it is logically possible that the mummy is also awake.\n\nHowever, the statement \"Also, the mummy was awake\" does not necessarily imply that the vampire was awake. It only means that the mummy was awake, but it does not provide any information about the vampire's state.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the vampire was awake based on the information provided. The only thing we can conclude is that the mummy was awake, but we cannot say anything about the vampire's state.\n\nAnswer: No.",
