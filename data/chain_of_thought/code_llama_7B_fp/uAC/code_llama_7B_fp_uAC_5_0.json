Amy played tennis.\n\nWe want to know if we can infer that Jeff played basketball.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to look at the relationship between the two statements. The first statement implies that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. This means that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\n\nThe second statement says that Amy played tennis. This means that Amy did play tennis, regardless of whether Jeff played basketball or not.\n\nSo, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball, because if he did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis. However, we cannot infer that Jeff played basketball, because we do not know whether he played basketball or not.\n\nAnswer: No.",
