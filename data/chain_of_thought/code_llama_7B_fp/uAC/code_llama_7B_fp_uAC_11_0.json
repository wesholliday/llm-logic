This is a conditional statement, which means that the conclusion (the muffins being blueberry) follows logically from the premise (the cake being chocolate).\n\nThe second statement \"The muffins were blueberry\" is a separate statement that does not necessarily imply anything about the cake. It simply states that the muffins are blueberry.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the cake was chocolate based on the two statements given. The second statement does not provide any information about the cake, and the first statement only implies that the muffins are blueberry if the cake is chocolate.",
