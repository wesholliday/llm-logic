This is because the statement is a conditional statement, which means that the conclusion (the truck being metal) follows logically from the premise (the doll being plastic).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the doll was plastic based on the information that the truck was metal. However, we cannot infer the opposite, that the truck was metal based on the fact that the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
