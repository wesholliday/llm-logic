This statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the condition stated in the \"if\" clause is met. In this case, the condition is that the book was written by James.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the book was written by James, because the statement implies that the book is a mystery novel if it was written by James. This means that the book must have been written by James in order for the statement to be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
