This means that if the car was red, then we can infer that the truck was blue.\n\nHowever, the statement \"Also, the truck was blue\" does not necessarily imply that the car was red. It simply states that the truck was blue, without providing any additional information about the car.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the car was red based on the information provided. The statement \"Also, the truck was blue\" does not provide any additional information about the car, and the statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" does not logically imply that the car was red.\n\nAnswer: No.",
