Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nFrom the first two statements, we can infer that Mark bought the blue shirt, and Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nNow, let's consider the third statement:\n\n\"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThis statement is a contradiction to the first two statements. If Mark bought the blue shirt, then it means that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Therefore, we cannot infer that Lisa bought the red shirt based on the third statement alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
