Also, Chris finished the race.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This means that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race, and we can also conclude that Chris finished the race.\n\nNow, we have two statements:\n\n1. If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n2. Chris finished the race.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can infer that Alex finished the race. This is because if the first statement is true, then the second statement must also be true. Therefore, if Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
