This means that if the shirt was cotton, then it is likely that the pants were denim. However, it does not necessarily mean that the shirt was cotton.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the shirt was cotton based solely on the fact that the pants were denim. We need more information or evidence to make a conclusion about the shirt's material.\n\nAnswer: No.",
