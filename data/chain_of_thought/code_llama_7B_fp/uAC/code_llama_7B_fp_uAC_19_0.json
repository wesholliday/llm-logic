Jen watched basketball.\n\nWe want to know if we can infer that Tom watched football.\n\nTo do this, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements. The first statement implies that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This means that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nThe second statement simply states that Jen watched basketball. This does not provide any information about Tom.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Tom watched football based on the two statements given.",
