To infer whether Sue chose pizza, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements.\n\nIf Sue chose pizza and Bob chose pasta, then it is possible that Sue chose pasta as well. However, if Bob chose pasta, it is unlikely that Sue chose pizza, as Bob's choice of pasta would have influenced Sue's choice.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Sue chose pizza based on the information provided. The only conclusion we can draw is that Bob chose pasta.\n\nAnswer: No.",
