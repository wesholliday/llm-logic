Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nWe want to know if we can infer that Joe went to the park.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to look at the information provided in the two statements. The first statement tells us that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. This means that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo as well.\n\nThe second statement tells us that Lucy went to the zoo. This means that Lucy went to the zoo, regardless of whether or not Joe went to the park.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, we can infer that Lucy went to the zoo, but we cannot infer that Joe went to the park.\n\nAnswer: No.",
