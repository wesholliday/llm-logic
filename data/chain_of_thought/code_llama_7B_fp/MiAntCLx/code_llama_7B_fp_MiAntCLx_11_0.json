This statement implies that \"fizzle\" and \"frazzle\" are interchangeable or synonymous, as the word \"might be\" suggests a possibility or equivalence between the two. However, it does not provide any information about the relationship between \"frazzle\" and \"quork\". The statement does not mention \"quork\" at all, so we cannot infer any connection between \"frazzle\" and \"quork\" based on this statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
