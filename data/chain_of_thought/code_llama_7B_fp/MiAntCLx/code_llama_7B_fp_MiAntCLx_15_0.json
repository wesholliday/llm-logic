The phrase \"The quork might be wobble flonk wobble\" is a sequence of words that does not convey any specific meaning or implication. \n\nWhen we try to infer additional information from this statement, we are essentially trying to make a logical connection between the original statement and the new statement \"The quork might be wobble flonk wobble and wumble a snizzle\". However, since the original statement is nonsensical, there is no logical basis for making such an inference. The words \"wobble flonk wobble\" and \"wumble a snizzle\" are not related to each other in any way, and there is no indication that the original statement implies the existence of \"wumble a snizzle\".\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
