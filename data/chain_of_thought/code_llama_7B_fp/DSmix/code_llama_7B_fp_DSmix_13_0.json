The glip might not be tragged.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The glip is slogged,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given statements.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the glip is not slogged by the second statement. If the glip might not be tragged, then it is not necessary that it is slogged. Therefore, we can conclude that the glip is slogged.\n\nSecond, we can use the first statement to further support our conclusion. If the glip is slogged or it must be tragged, then it is slogged. Therefore, we can conclude that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
