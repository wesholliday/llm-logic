The first premise states that either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled. The second premise states that the sprocket might not be daggled.\n\nIf we assume that the sprocket is not daggled, then it must be cranked. This is because if the sprocket is not daggled, then it must be cranked, as the first premise states. However, if the sprocket is daggled, then it cannot be cranked, as the second premise states.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
