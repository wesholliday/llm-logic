In this case, we can infer that the wug is flooped.\n\nOn the other hand, if the wug might not be bimmed, then it is possible that it is not flooped. In this case, we cannot infer that the wug is flooped.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The wug is flooped' from 'Either the wug is flooped or it must be bimmed' together with 'The wug might not be bimmed'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
