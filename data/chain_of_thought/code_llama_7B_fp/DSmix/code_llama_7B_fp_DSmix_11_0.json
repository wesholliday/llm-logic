The flug might not be zimmed.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The flug is blummed,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given statements.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the flug is not blummed by the second statement. This means that the flug must be blummed.\n\nSecond, we can infer that the flug is blummed based on the first statement. This means that either the flug is blummed or it must be zimmed. Since we have already determined that the flug is blummed, we can conclude that it must be zimmed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
