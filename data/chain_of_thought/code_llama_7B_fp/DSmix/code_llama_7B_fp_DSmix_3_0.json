The splat might not be quanked.\n\nTo infer the third statement, we need to use logical reasoning.\n\nIf the splat is morphed, then it must be quanked. Therefore, the first statement implies that the splat is morphed.\n\nOn the other hand, if the splat is not quanked, then it might not be morphed. However, this does not necessarily mean that the splat is morphed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the third statement from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No.",
