The shank might not be nugged.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The shank is plooked,\" we need to consider the possible combinations of the given statements.\n\nIf the shank is plooked, then it must be nugged, as stated in the first statement. Therefore, if the shank is plooked, it cannot be nugged, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nOn the other hand, if the shank is not plooked, then it might not be nugged, as stated in the second statement. Therefore, if the shank is not plooked, it cannot be nugged, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the conclusion \"The shank is plooked\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No.",
