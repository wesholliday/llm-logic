This premise implies that the flugel is either blimmed or it is not blimmed.\n\nThe second premise states that the flugel might not be zargled. This premise implies that the flugel might be blimmed or it might not be zargled.\n\nThe conclusion \"The flugel is blimmed\" states that the flugel is blimmed. This conclusion is not necessarily implied by the premises.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the conclusion \"The flugel is blimmed\" from the premises \"Either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled\" and \"The flugel might not be zargled.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
