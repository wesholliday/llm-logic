The flob might not be movated.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The flob is skizzled,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given information.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the flob is not skizzled by the second statement \"The flob might not be movated.\" This means that the flob is either skizzled or movated.\n\nNext, we can use the first statement to infer that the flob is skizzled. If the flob is not movated, then it must be skizzled, as the first statement states that either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
