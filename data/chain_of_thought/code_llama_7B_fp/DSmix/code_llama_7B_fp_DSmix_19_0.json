The smonk might not be plagged.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The smonk is vreebled,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given statements.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the smonk is plagged by the second statement. This means that the smonk is either vreebled or not plagged.\n\nNext, we can infer that the smonk is vreebled because the first statement implies that if the smonk is not vreebled, it must be plagged. This means that if the smonk is not vreebled, it must be plagged, which contradicts the second statement. Therefore, we can conclude that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
