The grommet might not be plopped.\n\nTo infer the conclusion, we need to consider the possible combinations of the given statements.\n\nIf the grommet is sploffed, then it must be plopped. Therefore, the conclusion \"The grommet is sploffed\" follows logically from the first statement.\n\nOn the other hand, if the grommet might not be plopped, then it is possible that it is not sploffed. In this case, the conclusion \"The grommet is sploffed\" does not follow logically from the given statements.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The grommet is sploffed\" can be inferred from the given statements if and only if the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
