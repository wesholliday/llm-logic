The first premise, \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake,\" states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was also awake. This means that if the vampire was awake, then it is also true that the mummy was awake.\n\nThe second premise, \"The mummy was awake,\" states that the mummy was indeed awake. This premise is independent of the first premise, and it does not contradict it.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can logically conclude that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
