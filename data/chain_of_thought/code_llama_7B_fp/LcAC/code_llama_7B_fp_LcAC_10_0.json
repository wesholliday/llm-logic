The first premise is \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This means that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n\nThe second premise is \"The cat was outside.\" This means that the cat was outside, regardless of whether the dog was inside or outside.\n\nNow, we need to use the first premise to deduce that the dog was inside. We can do this by using the contrapositive of the first premise, which is \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside.\"\n\nTherefore, we can logically conclude that the dog was inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
