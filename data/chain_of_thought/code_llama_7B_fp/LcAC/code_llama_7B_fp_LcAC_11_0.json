The first statement, \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry,\" implies that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. This means that if the cake was chocolate, then we can conclude that the muffins were blueberry.\n\nThe second statement, \"The muffins were blueberry,\" simply states that the muffins were blueberry, without any additional information.\n\nTherefore, to logically conclude that the cake was chocolate, we need to consider both statements together. If the muffins were blueberry, and the cake was chocolate, then we can conclude that the cake was chocolate. However, if the muffins were blueberry and the cake was not chocolate, then we cannot logically conclude that the cake was chocolate.\n\nAnswer: No.",
