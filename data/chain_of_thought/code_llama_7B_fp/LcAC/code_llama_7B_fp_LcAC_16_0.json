The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" implies that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. This means that if the shirt was cotton, then we can infer that the pants were denim.\n\nHowever, we are given the additional information that the pants were denim. This information does not contradict the first statement, but rather provides additional information that can help us make a conclusion.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can logically conclude that the shirt was cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
