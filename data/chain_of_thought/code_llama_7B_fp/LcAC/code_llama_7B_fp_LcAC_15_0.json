The first premise is \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" The second premise is \"Erin took a train.\"\n\nNow, we need to use the first premise to deduce that Sam took a plane. We can do this by using the following steps:\n\n1. If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n2. Erin took a train.\n3. Therefore, if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n\nIn this deduction, we have used the first premise to deduce that Sam took a plane, based on the fact that Erin took a train. Therefore, we can logically conclude that Sam took a plane.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
