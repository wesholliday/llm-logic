Chris finished the race.\n\nTo determine whether we can logically conclude that Alex finished the race, we need to analyze the given statements and their logical relationships.\n\nFirstly, we need to determine the meaning of the given statements. \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" means that if Alex finished the race, then Chris also finished the race. This implies that Chris finished the race only if Alex finished the race.\n\nSecondly, we need to identify the premises and the conclusion of the argument. The premises are \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" and \"Chris finished the race.\" The conclusion is \"Alex finished the race.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\n1. The premises are true. If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This is a logical implication, and it is true.\n2. The conclusion is also true. Chris finished the race. This is also a logical implication, and it is true.\n\nTherefore, we can logically conclude that Alex finished the race. The argument is valid, and we can draw the conclusion that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
