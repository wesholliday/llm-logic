The truck was metal.\n\nTo determine whether we can logically conclude that the doll was plastic, we need to analyze the validity of the premises and the soundness of the conclusion.\n\n1. The validity of the first premise is based on the assumption that the doll was plastic. If this assumption is false, then the premise is not valid. However, we are given no information about the material of the doll, so we can assume that it is valid.\n2. The validity of the second premise is based on the assumption that the truck was metal. If this assumption is false, then the premise is not valid. However, we are given that the truck was metal, so we can assume that it is valid.\n\nNow, let's analyze the soundness of the conclusion.\n\nIf the conclusion is \"The doll was plastic,\" then we can conclude that the doll was plastic based on the premises. However, if the conclusion is \"The doll was not plastic,\" then we cannot conclude that the doll was not plastic based on the premises.\n\nTherefore, we can logically conclude that the doll was plastic based on the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
