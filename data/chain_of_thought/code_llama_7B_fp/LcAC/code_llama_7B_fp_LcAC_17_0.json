The premise \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that implies a certain outcome if a certain condition is met. In this case, the condition is that Ben ate pasta.\n2. The premise \"Kate ate salad\" is an independent statement, which means that it is a statement that is not dependent on any other statement.\n3. The conclusion \"Ben ate pasta\" is also an independent statement, which means that it is a statement that is not dependent on any other statement.\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of logical deduction to determine whether we can logically conclude that Ben ate pasta based on the given premises.\n\n1. We can only logically conclude that Ben ate pasta if the premise \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" is true.\n2.
