The unicorn was in the forest.\n\nTo logically conclude that the griffin was in the forest, we need to use the first premise to reason backwards. We can do this by assuming that the griffin was not in the forest, and then using the first premise to arrive at a contradiction.\n\nAssume that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\n1. If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\n2. The unicorn was in the forest.\n\nFrom the second premise, we know that the unicorn was in the forest. But from the first premise, we know that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. Therefore, we have a contradiction, which means that our assumption that the griffin was not in the forest must be false.\n\nTherefore, we can logically conclude that the griffin was in the forest.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
