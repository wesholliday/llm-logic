            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statements are:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n2. Sue was at the wedding.\n\nTo determine whether we can logically conclude that Mary was at the wedding, we need to analyze the statements and their logical relationships.\n\nFirstly, we need to determine the meaning of the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the consequent (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true. The second statement is an unconditional statement, which means that it is always true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationships between the statements. The first statement is a conditional statement, and the second statement is an unconditional statement. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that Mary was at the wedding based on these two statements alone.\n\nHowever, if we have additional information that contradicts the first statement, then we can logically conclude that Mary was not at the wedding. For example, if we know that Mary was not at the wedding, then we can conclude that Sue was not at the wedding, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no, we cannot logically conclude that Mary was at the wedding based on the given statements.",
