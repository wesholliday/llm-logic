The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry. This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n\nThe second premise states that it is not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry. This is a negation, which means that the statement must be false.\n\nThe conclusion states that the cookies are in the jar. This statement is not necessarily true, as it is possible that the cookies are hidden in the pantry, even if the second premise is false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.",
