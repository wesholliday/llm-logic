The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist. This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\nThe second premise states that it is not the case that the watch must be on his wrist. This is a negation, which means that the opposite of the statement must be true.\n\nThe conclusion states that the watch is charging on the dresser. This is a statement that is not necessarily true, as it is not logically implied by the premises.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid.",
