The first statement, \"The toy isn't sitting on the shelf,\" implies that the toy is not in its usual location, which is on the shelf. The second statement, \"Either the toy is sitting on the shelf or it is in the toy box,\" provides a logical alternative to the first statement, which suggests that the toy could be in the toy box. Therefore, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
