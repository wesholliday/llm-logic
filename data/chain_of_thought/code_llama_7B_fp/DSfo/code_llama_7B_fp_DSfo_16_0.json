Either the pen is on my desk or it is in my bag.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The pen is in my bag,\" we need to use logical reasoning.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the pen is on my desk, since the first premise states that it isn't. This means that the pen must be in my bag.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The pen is in my bag\" can be logically inferred from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
