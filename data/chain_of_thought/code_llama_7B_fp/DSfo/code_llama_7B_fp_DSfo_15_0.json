Either the shoes are lined up by the door or they are in the closet.\n\nWe want to infer whether the shoes are in the closet or not.\n\nTo do this, we can use a process of elimination. We know that the shoes are not lined up by the door, so we can eliminate the possibility that they are lined up by the door. This leaves us with the possibility that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
