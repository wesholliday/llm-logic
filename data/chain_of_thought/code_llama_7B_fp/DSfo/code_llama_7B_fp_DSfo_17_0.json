The first statement, \"The scarf isn't draped on the coat rack,\" indicates that the scarf is not currently hanging on the coat rack, which means it must be somewhere else. The second statement, \"Either the scarf is draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack,\" provides a logical contradiction if the scarf is not draped on the coat rack. This contradiction can only be resolved if the scarf is actually stuffed in your backpack. Therefore, we can infer that the scarf is stuffed in your backpack based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
