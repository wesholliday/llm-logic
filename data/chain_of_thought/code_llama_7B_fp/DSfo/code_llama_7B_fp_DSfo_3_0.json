Either the keys are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The keys are in the drawer,\" we need to consider the possible combinations of the given premises.\n\nIf the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, then it is possible that they are in the drawer. This is because the second premise states that either the keys are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer, and the first premise rules out the possibility that the keys are dangling in the cabinet. Therefore, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
