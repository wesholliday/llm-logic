If the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor, then it cannot be in the box, as the second premise states that either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it is blending in on the floor. Therefore, we can conclude that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor.\n\nNext, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box based on the second premise. If the missing puzzle piece is in the box, then it is not blending in on the floor, as we have already established that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor. Therefore, we can conclude that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
