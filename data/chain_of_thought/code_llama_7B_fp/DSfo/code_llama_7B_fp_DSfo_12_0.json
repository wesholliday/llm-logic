Therefore, the jacket must be draped over the chair.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The jacket is draped over the chair\" can be inferred from the premises \"The jacket isn't hanging in the closet\" and \"Either the jacket is hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
