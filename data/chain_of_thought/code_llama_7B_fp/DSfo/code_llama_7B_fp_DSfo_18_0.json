The first statement, \"The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand,\" indicates that the notebook is not in the same location as the nightstand. The second statement, \"Either the notebook is sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer,\" provides a logical alternative to the first statement, which implies that the notebook is in the drawer. Therefore, we can conclude that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
