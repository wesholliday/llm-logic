Either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside.\n\nWe want to infer whether Fido is inside.\n\nTo do this, we need to consider the possible combinations of the two statements.\n\nIf Fido is not in the garden, then it is possible that Fido is inside. In this case, the first statement would be false, and the second statement would be true, so we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
