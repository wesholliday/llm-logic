This means that the umbrella must be in the car.\n\nSecond, we can infer that the umbrella is in the car because the second statement states that either the umbrella is tucked away in the closet or it is in the car. Since we have already eliminated the possibility that the umbrella is tucked away in the closet, the only remaining possibility is that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The umbrella is in the car.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
