Either the book is resting on the table or it is on the shelf.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The book is on the shelf,\" we need to consider the possible interpretations of the given premises and the relationship between them.\n\nFrom the first premise, we can infer that the book is not resting on the table. This means that the book is either on the shelf or it is somewhere else.\n\nFrom the second premise, we can infer that the book is either resting on the table or it is on the shelf.
