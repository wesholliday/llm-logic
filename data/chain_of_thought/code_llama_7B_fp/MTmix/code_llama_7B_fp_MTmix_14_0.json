This means that if the clug was fleeked, it must have been snugged, and therefore, it cannot be the case that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nOn the other hand, 'The clug might not have been snugged' suggests that it is possible that the clug was not snugged, even if it was fleeked. This means that the possibility of the clug not being snugged is not ruled out, even if it was fleeked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The clug was not fleeked' from 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged' together with 'The clug might not have been snugged'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
