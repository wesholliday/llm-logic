It might not have been surned.\n\nTo infer \"The fleeg was not bluttered,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we need to consider the first premise:\n\nIf the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\n\nThis premise implies that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned. This means that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it was surned.\n\nNext, we need to consider the second premise:\n\nIt might not have been surned.\n\nThis premise suggests that it is possible that the fleeg was not surned, even if it was bluttered. This means that the fleeg might not have been surned, even if it was bluttered.\n\nNow, let's use these two premises to infer \"The fleeg was not bluttered.\"\n\nIf the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\n\nThis means that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it was surned.\n\nHowever, it might not have been surned.\n\nThis means that it is possible that the fleeg was not surned, even if it was bluttered.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The fleeg was not bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
