The flugel might not have been zargled.\n\nTo infer whether the flugel was blimmed or not, we need to consider both statements and their logical relationships.\n\nFirstly, we can see that the first statement implies that if the flugel was blimmed, then it must have been zargled. This means that if the flugel was blimmed, then it is certain that it was zargled.\n\nSecondly, we can see that the second statement suggests that the flugel might not have been zargled. This means that it is possible that the flugel was not blimmed, even if it was blimmed.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the flugel was blimmed. If the flugel was blimmed, then it must have been zargled, as per the first statement. However, if the flugel was blimmed, then it might not have been zargled, as per the second statement. This creates a contradiction, as we cannot have it both ways. Therefore, we can conclude that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nOn the other hand, if the flugel was not blimmed, then it is possible that it was zargled, as per the first statement. However, if the flugel was not blimmed, then it might not have been zargled, as per the second statement. This means that we cannot make any conclusions about the flugel's zargling status based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
