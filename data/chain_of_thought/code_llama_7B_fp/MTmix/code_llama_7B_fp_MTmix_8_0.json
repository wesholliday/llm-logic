The sprocket might not have been daggled.\n\nTo infer whether the sprocket was cranked or not, we need to consider both statements and their logical relationships.\n\n1. If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled.\nThis statement implies that if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled. This means that if the sprocket was cranked, then it is certain that the sprocket was daggled.\n2. The sprocket might not have been daggled.\nThis statement does not necessarily imply that the sprocket was not cranked. It only means that the sprocket might not have been daggled, which does not necessarily mean that it was not cranked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the sprocket was not cranked based on these two statements alone. We need more information or evidence to determine whether the sprocket was cranked or not.\n\nAnswer: No.",
