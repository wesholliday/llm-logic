This means that if the fribble was snurgled, it must have crinked.\n\nThe fribble might not have crinked. This means that the fribble might not have crinked, even if it was snurgled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The fribble was not snurgled\" if we know that the fribble might not have crinked, and we know that the fribble was snurgled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
