The smip might not have lupped the zoint.\n\nTo infer whether the smip was not shripped, we need to consider both statements and their logical relationships.\n\n1. If the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint.\nThis statement implies that if the smip was shripped, then it must have performed the action of lupping the zoint.\n2. The smip might not have lupped the zoint.\nThis statement suggests that the smip might not have performed the action of lupping the zoint, even if it was shripped.\n\nNow, let's analyze the two statements together:\n\nIf the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint.\nThe smip might not have lupped the zoint.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can infer that the smip was not shripped.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
