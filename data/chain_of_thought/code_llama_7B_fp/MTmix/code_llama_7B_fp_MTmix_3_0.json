The splat might not have quanked.\n\nTo infer whether the splat was morphed or not, we need to analyze the given statements and their logical relationships.\n\nFirstly, let's consider the first statement:\n\n\"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked.\"\n\nThis statement implies that if the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked. This means that if the splat was morphed, then it is certain that the splat quanked.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement:\n\n\"The splat might not have quanked.\"\n\nThis statement does not necessarily imply that the splat was not morphed. It simply means that the splat might not have quanked, regardless of whether it was morphed or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the splat was not morphed based on the given statements alone. We need to consider other factors or evidence to make a conclusion about the splat's morphing status.\n\nAnswer: No.",
