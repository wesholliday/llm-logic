The shank might not have been nugged.\n\nTo infer whether the shank was plooked or not, we need to consider both statements and their logical relationships.\n\n1. If the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged. This means that if the shank was plooked, it must have been nugged.\n2. The shank might not have been nugged. This means that the shank might not have been nugged, even if it was plooked.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements together:\n\nIf the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged.\nThe shank might not have been nugged.\n\nBased on these statements, we can infer that the shank was not plooked. This is because if the shank was plooked, it would have been nugged, but it might not have been nugged if it was not plooked. Therefore, we can conclude that the shank was not plooked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
