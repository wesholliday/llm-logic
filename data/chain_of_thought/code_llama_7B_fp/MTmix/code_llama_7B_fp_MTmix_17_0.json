The flob might not have movated.\n\nTo infer \"The flob was not skizzled,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\n1. If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated.\n2. The flob might not have movated.\n\nWe can infer \"The flob was not skizzled\" by using the following reasoning:\n\n1. If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated.\n2. The flob might not have movated.\n\nIf the flob was skizzled, then it must have movated, according to the first premise. However, if the flob might not have movated, then it cannot be inferred that the flob was skizzled. Therefore, we can infer that \"The flob was not skizzled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
