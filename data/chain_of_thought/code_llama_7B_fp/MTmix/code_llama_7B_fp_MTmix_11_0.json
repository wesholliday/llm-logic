The flight might not have been canceled.\n\nTo infer the conclusion, we need to use logical reasoning and the given information.\n\nStep 1: Identify the premises and the conclusion.\n\nPremises:\n\n1. If the flight was delayed, then the flight must have been canceled.\n2. The flight might not have been canceled.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe flight was not canceled.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the premises and the conclusion.\n\nBased on the given information, we can infer that the flight was not canceled. This is because the premise \"If the flight was delayed, then the flight must have been canceled\" implies that if the flight was delayed, then it must have been canceled. However, the second premise \"The flight might not have been canceled\" contradicts this inference, as it suggests that the flight might not have been canceled. Therefore, we can conclude that the flight was not canceled.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the premises.\n\nBased on the given information, we can infer that the flight was not canceled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
