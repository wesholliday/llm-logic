This means that if the wug was flooped, then it is certain that it bimmed the zoint.\n\nSecondly, the second premise \"The wug might not have bimmed the zoint\" suggests that the wug might not have bimmed the zoint, even if it was flooped. This means that the wug's bimming the zoint is not a necessary consequence of being flooped.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion \"The wug was not flooped.\" This conclusion is based on the fact that the wug did not bim the zoint, which is not a necessary consequence of being flooped. Therefore, we can infer that the wug was not flooped, since it did not bim the zoint.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
