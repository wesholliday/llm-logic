In this case, we are trying to infer that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the information provided in the statement. We know that Sue chose pizza, and we also know that Bob chose pasta. This means that there is a connection between the two choices, and we can infer that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n\nHowever, we are not given any information about what Sue did not choose. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta. This is because we do not have enough information to make a conclusion about what Bob chose.\n\nAnswer: No.",
