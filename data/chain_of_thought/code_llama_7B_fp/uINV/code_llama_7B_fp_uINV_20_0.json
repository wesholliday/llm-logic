            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis is a classic logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the condition) is true. In this case, the antecedent is \"the apple was red.\"\n\nThe statement \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow\" is an affirming the consequent, which means that it is true regardless of whether the antecedent is true or not. This is because the consequent (the statement that follows the \"then\") is not dependent on the antecedent.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow. The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is true only if the apple was red, but the statement \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow\" is true regardless of whether the apple was red or not.\n\nAnswer: No.",
