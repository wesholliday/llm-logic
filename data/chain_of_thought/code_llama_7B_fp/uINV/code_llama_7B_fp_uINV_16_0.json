In this case, the condition is that the shirt was cotton.\n\nNow, let's consider the second part of the statement: \"Can we infer that if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim?\"\n\nThis is a question that is asking us to infer a conclusion based on the premise that the shirt was not cotton. However, we have already established that the shirt was cotton, so we cannot infer that the pants were not denim based on this premise.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is no. We cannot infer that if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.",
