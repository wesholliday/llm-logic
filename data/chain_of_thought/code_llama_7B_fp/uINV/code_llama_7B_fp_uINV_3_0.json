This is a yes or no question, and the answer is yes.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe question is based on the assumption that the book was written by James, and it is asking whether we can infer that if the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel. This is a logical inference, and it is a valid one. If the book was not written by James, then it is not a mystery novel, because the book was written by James. Therefore, we can infer that if the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
