This is a conditional statement, and we need to analyze the premise and conclusion to determine if the inference is valid.\n\nPremise: The cake was chocolate.\nConclusion: The muffins were blueberry.\n\nInference: If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nTo determine if the inference is valid, we need to consider the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. If the premise is false, then the conclusion does not necessarily follow. Therefore, we need to evaluate the validity of the premise.\n\nThe premise is based on the assumption that the cake was chocolate. However, we do not have any information about the cake's flavor, so we cannot be certain that it was chocolate. Therefore, the premise is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, the inference is not valid, and we cannot infer that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.",
