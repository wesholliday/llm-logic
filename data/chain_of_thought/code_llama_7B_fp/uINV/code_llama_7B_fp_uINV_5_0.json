The fallacy occurs when we infer that a conclusion follows from a premise, but the conclusion is not necessarily true.\n\nIn this case, we can infer that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis, because if Jeff did not play basketball, then it is unlikely that he would have played tennis. However, this does not necessarily mean that Amy did not play tennis if Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: No.",
