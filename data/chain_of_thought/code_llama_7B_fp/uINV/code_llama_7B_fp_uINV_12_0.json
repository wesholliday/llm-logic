            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis is a classic example of a logical argument, known as a conditional statement. The statement is asking if we can infer that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nTo determine if we can infer this, we need to look at the premises and the conclusion of the argument. The premises are:\n\n1. Joe went to the park\n2. Lucy went to the zoo\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\nIf Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nTo determine if we can infer the conclusion, we need to look at the validity of the argument. The argument is valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nIn this case, the conclusion logically follows from the premises because if Joe did not go to the park, then it is possible that Lucy did not go to the zoo. However, it is not necessary that Lucy did not go to the zoo if Joe did not go to the park.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
