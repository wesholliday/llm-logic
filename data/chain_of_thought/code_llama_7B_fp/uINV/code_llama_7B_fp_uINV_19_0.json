The fallacy occurs when we infer a conclusion based on the assumption that the antecedent is true, without considering the possibility that the antecedent may be false.\n\nIn this case, we can infer that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball, because we know that Tom watched football and Jen watched basketball. However, we cannot infer that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball, because we do not know for certain that Tom did not watch football.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is no, we cannot infer that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.",
