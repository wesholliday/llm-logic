The fallacy occurs when we infer that a conclusion follows from a premise, but the conclusion is not necessarily true. In this case, we are inferring that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding. However, this conclusion is not necessarily true, as there may be other factors that could have caused Sue to not attend the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No.",
