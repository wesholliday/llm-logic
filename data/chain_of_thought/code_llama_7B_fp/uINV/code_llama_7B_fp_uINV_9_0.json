            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis is a classic example of a logical deduction problem. The given information is that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. We are asked to infer that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nTo make the inference, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the consequent (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true. The second statement is also a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Lisa did not buy the red shirt) is true, then the consequent (Mark did not buy the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\nNow, we need to consider the relationship between the two conditional statements. If the antecedent of the first statement is true, then the consequent must also be true. Similarly, if the antecedent of the second statement is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n\nTherefore, if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
