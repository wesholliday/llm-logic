The premise of the argument is that the bear was in the cave, and the conclusion is that the wolf was in the den. The question is asking whether we can infer that the wolf was in the den if the bear was not in the cave.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the relationship between the bear and the wolf. The wolf is a den mate of the bear, which means that the wolf lives in the same den as the bear. If the bear is not in the cave, then the wolf is not in the den. Therefore, we can infer that if the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
