            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical inference. The statement \"The document might be signed or notarized\" implies that the document could be in one of two states: either it is signed, or it is notarized. The use of the word \"or\" indicates that these are mutually exclusive possibilities, meaning that the document cannot be both signed and notarized at the same time. Therefore, if the document is notarized, it cannot be signed, and if it is signed, it cannot be notarized. This means that the statement \"The document might be signed\" is a subset of the original statement, and we can logically infer that if the document might be signed or notarized, then it indeed might be signed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
