            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The movie might be in English or subtitled\" implies that there are two possibilities for the language of the movie: it might be in English, or it might be subtitled (meaning it's in a different language with English subtitles). The use of \"or\" suggests that these are two distinct alternatives, and the first option is that the movie might be in English. Therefore, we can infer that the movie might indeed be in English.\n\nAnswer: yes"
