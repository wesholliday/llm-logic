This is an inclusive \"or\" statement, meaning that both options are possibilities. Therefore, if the package might be delivered today, it is indeed included in the possibilities mentioned in the original statement. This means we can infer that \"The package might be delivered today\" is indeed a valid conclusion based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
