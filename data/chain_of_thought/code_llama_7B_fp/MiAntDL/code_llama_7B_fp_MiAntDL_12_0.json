            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The project might be completed by Friday or extended\" implies that there are two possible outcomes: the project is completed by Friday or it is extended. The word \"or\" indicates that these are mutually exclusive possibilities. Therefore, if the project is extended, it cannot be completed by Friday. However, the statement does not rule out the possibility that the project might be completed by Friday. It simply presents it as one of the possible outcomes. Therefore, we can infer that the project might be completed by Friday, but we cannot infer that it will be completed by Friday.\n\nAnswer: yes"
