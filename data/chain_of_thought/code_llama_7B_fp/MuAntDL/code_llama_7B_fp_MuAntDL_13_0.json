The use of \"or\" indicates that these are two separate possibilities. Therefore, we can infer that the movie could have been in English, but we cannot be certain that it was. However, we can also infer that the movie was not subtitled in English, because if it was, the statement would have said \"The movie must have been in English or in English\", which would be redundant. \n\nAnswer: no"
