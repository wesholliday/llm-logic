The original statement \"The document must have been signed or notarized\" is a disjunction, meaning it includes two possibilities: either the document was signed or it was notarized. The statement \"The document must have been signed\" is a specific case within this disjunction, where the document was signed but not necessarily notarized. We can infer this because the original statement explicitly includes \"signed\" as one of the two possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes"
