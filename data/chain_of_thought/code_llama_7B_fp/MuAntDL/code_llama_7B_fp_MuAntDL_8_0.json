The conclusion, however, is a conjunction, which means it presents two possibilities as a single event. This is a logical error because it ignores the possibility that the restaurant was open for limited hours on Monday. We cannot infer that the restaurant was closed on Monday based on the original statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
