            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical inference, where we can deduce a specific statement from a more general one. The original statement says that the application must have been completed either online or in person, which means that it covers two possibilities: online or in person. However, the question asks if we can infer that the application must have been completed online, which is only one of the two possibilities. Since the original statement does not rule out the possibility of the application being completed in person, we cannot infer that it must have been completed online.\n\nAnswer: no"
