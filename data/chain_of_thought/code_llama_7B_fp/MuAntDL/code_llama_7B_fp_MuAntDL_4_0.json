The conclusion \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM\" is an attempt to infer one of the possibilities from the original statement, but it ignores the other possibility (that the meeting was cancelled). This is a flawed inference because the original statement does not provide enough information to rule out the possibility of cancellation.\n\nAnswer: no"
