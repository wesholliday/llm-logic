            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical inference problem. The original statement \"The package must have been delivered yesterday or the day before\" is a disjunction, which means it includes two possibilities: either the package was delivered yesterday or it was delivered the day before. The statement does not provide any information that would allow us to determine which of the two possibilities is true. Therefore, we cannot infer that the package must have been delivered yesterday. We can only say that it must have been delivered either yesterday or the day before, but we cannot rule out the possibility that it was delivered the day before.\n\nAnswer: no"
