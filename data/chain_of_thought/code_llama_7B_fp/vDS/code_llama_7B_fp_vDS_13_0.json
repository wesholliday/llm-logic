The first premise is a disjunction, which means that it is either true or false. The second premise is also a disjunction, which means that it is either true or false. The conclusion is a disjunction, which means that it is either true or false.\n\nThe argument is also valid because it is based on a correct premise. The first premise is true because the toy is either in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf. The second premise is also true because the toy is not sitting on the shelf. Therefore, the conclusion is also true because the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
