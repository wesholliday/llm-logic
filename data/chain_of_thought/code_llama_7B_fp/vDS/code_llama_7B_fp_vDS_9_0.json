The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that the missing puzzle piece is either in the box or blending in on the floor. This premise is a tautology, as it is a statement that is always true.\n\nThe second premise states that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor. This premise is also a tautology, as it is a statement that is always true.\n\nThe conclusion states that the missing puzzle piece is in the box. This conclusion is not logically implied by the premises. In fact, it is the opposite of what the premises state.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid.",
