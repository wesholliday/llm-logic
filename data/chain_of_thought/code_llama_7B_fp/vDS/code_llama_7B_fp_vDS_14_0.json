The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that the milk is either on the counter or chilling in the fridge. The second premise states that the milk is not chilling in the fridge. These two premises together imply that the milk is on the counter.\n\nThe conclusion states that the milk is on the counter. However, this conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The conclusion is a conclusion that is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid.",
