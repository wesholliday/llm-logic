The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that the scarf is either stuffed in the backpack or draped on the coat rack. The second premise states that the scarf is not draped on the coat rack. However, the conclusion states that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\nThe conclusion does not logically follow from the premises because the second premise states that the scarf is not draped on the coat rack, which means that it cannot be stuffed in the backpack. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
