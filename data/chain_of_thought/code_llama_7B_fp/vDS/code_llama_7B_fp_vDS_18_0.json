The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that the notebook is either in the drawer or sitting on the nightstand. The second premise states that the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand. However, the conclusion states that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nThe argument is not valid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The conclusion is a conclusion that is not necessarily true. In this case, the notebook could be in the drawer and not sitting on the nightstand. The argument is not valid because it does not provide a logical explanation for why the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: No.",
