The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that either the jacket is draped over the chair or it is hanging in the closet. This premise is true, as the jacket is not hanging in the closet.\n\nThe second premise states that the jacket isn't hanging in the closet. This premise is also true, as the jacket is not hanging in the closet.\n\nThe conclusion states that the jacket is draped over the chair. This conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. If the jacket is not hanging in the closet, then it is not necessarily draped over the chair.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid.",
