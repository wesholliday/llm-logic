The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that the watch is either charging on the dresser or on the wrist. The second premise states that the watch is not on the wrist. However, the conclusion states that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nThe conclusion does not logically follow from the premises because the first premise does not provide enough information to determine whether the watch is charging on the dresser or not. The second premise only states that the watch is not on the wrist, but it does not provide any information about whether it is charging on the dresser or not.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.",
