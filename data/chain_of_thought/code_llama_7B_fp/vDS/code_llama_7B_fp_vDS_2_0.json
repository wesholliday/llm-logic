The first premise states that the book is either on the shelf or it is resting on the table. The second premise states that the book isn't resting on the table. The conclusion states that the book is on the shelf.\n\nThe argument is valid because it is possible for the book to be on the shelf and not resting on the table at the same time. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
