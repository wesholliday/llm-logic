The first premise is a disjunction, which means that it is either the pen is in my bag or it is on my desk. The second premise is a negation, which means that it is not the case that the pen is on my desk. The conclusion is also a disjunction, which means that it is either the pen is in my bag or it is not in my bag.\n\nThe argument is valid because it is possible for the pen to be in my bag, even if it is not on my desk. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
