The first premise states that either the keys are in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet, and the second premise states that the keys aren't dangling in the cabinet. The conclusion states that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nThe argument is valid because the first premise is a true statement, and the second premise is a true statement that contradicts the first premise. Therefore, the conclusion must also be a true statement, which is the case.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
