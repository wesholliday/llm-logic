Kate ate the salad.\n\nTo infer whether Ben ate pasta, we need to consider the relationship between the two premises. The first premise states that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad. This means that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad as a result of Ben eating pasta.\n\nThe second premise states that Kate ate the salad. This means that Kate ate the salad regardless of whether Ben ate pasta or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Ben ate pasta based on the given premises. The two premises do not necessarily imply that Ben ate pasta.\n\nAnswer: No.",
