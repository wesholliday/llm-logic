This means that if the car was red, then it is logically possible that the truck was blue.\n\nThe statement \"The truck was blue\" simply states that the truck was blue, without any additional information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The car was red\" from the two statements alone. We need additional information to make a conclusion about the color of the car.",
