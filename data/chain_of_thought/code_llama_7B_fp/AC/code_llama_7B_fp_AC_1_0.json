Sue was at the wedding.\n\nTo infer whether Mary was at the wedding, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements. The first statement implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. The second statement simply states that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Mary was at the wedding if and only if Sue was at the wedding. This is because the first statement provides a necessary condition for Mary to have been at the wedding, while the second statement provides a sufficient condition.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
