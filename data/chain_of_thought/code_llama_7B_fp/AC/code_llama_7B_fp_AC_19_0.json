The second premise states that Jen watched basketball.\n\nNow, we can use the first premise to infer that Tom watched football. We can do this by using a conditional statement, which states that if the antecedent (Tom watched football) is true, then the consequent (Jen watched basketball) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Tom watched football, since the first premise is true and the consequent is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
