Chris finished the race.\n\nTo infer whether Alex finished the race or not, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements. The first statement implies that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This means that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race either.\n\nThe second statement simply states that Chris finished the race. This does not provide any information about Alex's finishing status.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer whether Alex finished the race or not based on the given statements. The only information we have is that Chris finished the race, and we cannot make any conclusions about Alex's finishing status based on that.\n\nAnswer: No.",
