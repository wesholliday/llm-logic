This means that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" This statement does not provide any information about Joe's whereabouts. It only states that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Joe went to the park based on the two statements alone. We need more information to make an inference about Joe's whereabouts.\n\nAnswer: No.",
