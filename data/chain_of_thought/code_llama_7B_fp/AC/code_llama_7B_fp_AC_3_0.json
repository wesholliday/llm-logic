            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The book was written by James\" from the premises \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" and \"The book is a mystery novel,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the meaning of the premises. \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" means that if the book was written by James, then it is true that the book is a mystery novel. This is a conditional statement, which means that the conclusion follows from the premise if it is true.\n\nSecond, we need to understand the meaning of the conclusion. \"The book was written by James\" means that the book was written by James, which is a fact.\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of inference to the situation. We need to use the conditional statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" to infer the conclusion \"The book was written by James.\" To do this, we need to consider the following:\n\n* If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n* The book is a mystery novel.\n\nBased on these two premises, we can infer that the book was written by James. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
