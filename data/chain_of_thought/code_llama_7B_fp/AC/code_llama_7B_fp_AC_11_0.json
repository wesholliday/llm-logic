The muffins were blueberry.\n\nTo infer the cake was chocolate, we need to use the first statement as a premise and the second statement as a conclusion. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (cake was chocolate) is true, then the consequent (muffins were blueberry) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the cake was chocolate based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
