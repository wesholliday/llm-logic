The robot visited Jupiter.\n\nTo infer the third statement, we need to use the first statement as a premise and the second statement as a conclusion. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true. In this case, the premise is \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\" and the conclusion is \"The alien visited Mars.\"\n\nTo infer the third statement, we need to use the first statement as a premise and the second statement as a conclusion.
