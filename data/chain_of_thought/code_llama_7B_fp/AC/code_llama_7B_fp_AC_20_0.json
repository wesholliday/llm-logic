This means that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\n\nThe statement \"The banana was yellow\" is a separate statement that does not necessarily imply anything about the apple.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the apple was red based solely on the statements \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" and \"The banana was yellow.\" We need additional information or evidence to make a conclusion about the apple's color.\n\nAnswer: No.",
