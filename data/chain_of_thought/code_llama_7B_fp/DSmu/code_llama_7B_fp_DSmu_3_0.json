It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\n\nWe need to use logical reasoning to infer the conclusion that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the keys are dangling in the cabinet by the second statement. This means that the keys must be in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that the keys are in the drawer can be inferred.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
