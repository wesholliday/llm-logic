It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\n\nWe need to use logical reasoning to infer the conclusion that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry. This is because the second statement says that it's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry. If the cookies must be hidden in the pantry, then the second statement would be true, which contradicts our assumption that it's not the case.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry.\n\nNext, we can consider the possibility that the cookies are in the jar. If the cookies are in the jar, then the first statement would be true, because either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry.\n\nHowever, we have already eliminated the possibility that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry, so the only other possibility is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
