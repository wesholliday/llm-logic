It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\n\nWe need to use logical reasoning to infer the conclusion that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the watch must be on his wrist by using the second statement. This means that the watch is not on his wrist, which means it must be charging on the dresser.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that the watch is charging on the dresser can be inferred.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
