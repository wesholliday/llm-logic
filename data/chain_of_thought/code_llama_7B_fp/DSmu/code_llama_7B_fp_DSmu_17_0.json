It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\n\nWe need to use logical reasoning to infer the conclusion that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack, because of the second statement. Therefore, the scarf must be either stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack.\n\nSecond, we can infer that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack, because the first statement implies that the scarf is either stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack. If the scarf is not stuffed in my backpack, then it must be draped on the coat rack, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
