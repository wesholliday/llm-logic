The statement is \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk.\" This means that if the pen is not in my bag, then it must be on my desk.\n\nNow, we are given the additional information \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\" This means that the pen must be in my bag, since if it were on my desk, then the statement \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk\" would be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the pen is in my bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
