The statement says that either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head. This means that the sunglasses are either in her bag or they are not in her bag.\n\nThe second statement, \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head,\" means that the sunglasses are not necessarily perched on her head. This statement does not contradict the first statement, as it only says that the sunglasses are not necessarily perched on her head, not that they are in her bag.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag, as the first statement suggests that they are either in her bag or perched on her head, and the second statement does not contradict this.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
