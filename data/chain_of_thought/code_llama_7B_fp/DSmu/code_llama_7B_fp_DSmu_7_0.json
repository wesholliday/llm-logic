The umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet.\n2. It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\n\nFrom the first premise, we can infer that the umbrella is either in the car or it is not in the car. If the umbrella is in the car, then it is not necessary that it must be tucked away in the closet.\n\nFrom the second premise, we can infer that the umbrella must not be tucked away in the closet. This means that if the umbrella is not in the car, it must be in a different location, such as in the closet.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the umbrella is in the car, as it is not necessary that it must be tucked away in the closet.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
