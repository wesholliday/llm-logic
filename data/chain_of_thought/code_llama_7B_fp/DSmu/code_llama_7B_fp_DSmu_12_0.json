It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\n\nWe need to use logical reasoning to infer the conclusion that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the jacket must be hanging in the closet, because of the second statement. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
