Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed.\n2. It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\n\nThe conclusion is: The missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nTo arrive at this conclusion, we need to consider the first premise and the second premise separately.\n\nThe first premise states that either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed. This means that if the missing sock is not in the laundry basket, then it must be under the bed.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed. This means that if the missing sock is not in the laundry basket, then it must be in the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
