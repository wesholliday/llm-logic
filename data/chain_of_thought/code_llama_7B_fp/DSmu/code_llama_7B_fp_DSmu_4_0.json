The statement is \"Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom.\" This means that if the cat is not napping on the couch, it must be playing in the bedroom.\n\nNext, we have the additional information \"It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom.\" This means that the cat must be napping on the couch, as it is not the case that it must be playing in the bedroom.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
