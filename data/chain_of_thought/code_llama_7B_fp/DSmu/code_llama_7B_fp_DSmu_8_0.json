It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\n\nWe need to use logical reasoning to infer the conclusion that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the remote control is hiding under the couch by the second statement. This means that the remote control must be on the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
