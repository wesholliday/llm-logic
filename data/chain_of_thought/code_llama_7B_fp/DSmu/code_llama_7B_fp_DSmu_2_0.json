It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The book is on the shelf,\" we need to use logical reasoning to deduce it from the given premises.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the book is resting on the table by using the second premise. If the book were resting on the table, then the first premise would not hold, since the book would not be on the shelf. Therefore, we can conclude that the book is not resting on the table.\n\nNext, we can use the first premise to infer that the book is on the shelf. If the book were not on the shelf, then the first premise would not hold, since the book would not be either on the shelf or resting on the table. Therefore, we can conclude that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
