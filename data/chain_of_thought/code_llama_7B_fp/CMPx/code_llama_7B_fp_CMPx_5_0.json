    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fraglen, a darpil, and a votal are the top bispil teams this season. The fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by the darpil, while the votal trails far behind. These lead the league, so if the darpil doesn\u2019t have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn\u2019t, the votal will. Moreover, the fraglen likely will lead the league and hence the darpil likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fraglen doesn\u2019t lead the league, the votal will?",

The fraglen likely will lead the league and hence the darpil likely won\u2019t.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where the fraglen doesn't lead the league. In this case, the darpil will likely have the top record, and the votal will likely trail far behind.\n\nSo, the question is, is it likely that the votal will lead the league if the fraglen doesn't lead the league?\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
