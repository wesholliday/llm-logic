    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a dribbet, a vrendel, and a toffen lead this quarter\u2019s gadston sales. Market analysts expect the dribbet likely will retain the top sales spot, followed by the vrendel, with gadston sales for the toffen significantly lower. These dominate the gadston market currently, so if the vrendel isn\u2019t #1 in sales, then if the dribbet isn\u2019t #1, the toffen will be #1. Moreover, the dribbet likely will lead gadston sales this quarter and hence the vrendel likely won\u2019t lead sales. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the dribbet isn\u2019t #1 in gadston sales this quarter, the toffen will be #1?",

The answer is yes.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The dribbet is expected to retain the top sales spot, followed by the vrendel.\n2. The vrendel is expected to have lower gadston sales than the dribbet.\n3. The dribbet is expected to lead gadston sales this quarter.\n4. If the dribbet isn\u2019t #1 in gadston sales this quarter, the vrendel won\u2019t be #1 either.\n5. Therefore, if the dribbet isn\u2019t #1 in gadston sales this quarter, the toffen will be #1.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
