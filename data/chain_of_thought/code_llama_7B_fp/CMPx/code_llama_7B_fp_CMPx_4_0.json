    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crinel, a nafiz, and a tomul are competing to be snarggle of next year's laggle team. The crinel is considered the frontrunner for snarggle, followed by the nafiz, while the tomul is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates, if the nafiz isn\u2019t named snarggle, then if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle. Moreover, the crinel likely will be named snarggle and hence the nafiz likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be?",

If the crinel isn't named snarggle, the tomul will also be named snarggle.\n3. The crinel is considered the frontrunner for snarggle, followed by the nafiz.\n4. The tomul is a long shot.\n\nNow, let's consider the probability of each candidate being named snarggle:\n\n1. Nafiz: 1/3 (since it's a long shot)\n2. Crinel: 2/3 (since it's the frontrunner)\n3. Tomul: 1/3 (since it's a long shot)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability of the crinel not being named snarggle:\n\nP(crinel not named snarggle) = 1 - P(crinel named snarggle)\n= 1 - (2/3)^2\n= 1 - 0.4\n= 0.6\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability of the tomul being named snarggle:\n\nP(tomul named snarggle) = 1/3\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability of the tomul being named snarggle given that the crinel isn't named snarggle:\n\nP(tomul named snarggle | crinel not named snarggle)\n= P(tomul named snarggle) / P(crinel not named snarggle)\n= 1/3 / 0.6\n= 0.5\n\nSo, the probability of the tomul being named snarggle given that the crinel isn't named snarggle is 0.5, which means that it's likely that the tomul will be named snarggle if the crinel isn't named snarggle.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
