    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trenist, a lanken, and a draloid are shortlisted for Drij of the Year. The trenist is considered the front runner, followed by the lanken, while the draloid is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates in contention, if the lanken doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the trenist doesn\u2019t win it, the draloid will win it. Moreover, the trenist likely will win the award and hence the lanken likely won\u2019t win it. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trenist doesn\u2019t win Drij of the Year, the draloid will?",

The trenist likely will win the award and hence the lanken likely won\u2019t win it.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where the trenist doesn't win the award.\n\n4. If the trenist doesn't win the award, then the lanken will win it.\n5. Since the draloid is a long shot, it's unlikely that they will win the award.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that, if the trenist doesn't win Drij of the Year, the draloid will.",
