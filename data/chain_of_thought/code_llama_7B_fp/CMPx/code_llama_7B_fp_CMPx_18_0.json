    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a blimfet, a crongle, and a narzil are the leading bafwidgers. Experts expect the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most this year, followed by the crongle, with the narzil bafwidging much less. These are the only major bafwidgers, so if the crongle doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, then if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will bafwidge the most. Moreover, the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most, and hence the crongle likely won\u2019t bafwidge the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe question is asking whether it is likely that the narzil will bafwidge the most if the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most. The question assumes that the blimfet is likely to bafwidge the most, and that the crongle is likely to bafwidge less than the blimfet. The question also assumes that the narzil is likely to bafwidge less than the crongle.\n\nTo answer the question, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. If the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, then the crongle is likely to bafwidge the most.\n2. If the crongle doesn't bafwidge the most, then the narzil is likely to bafwidge the most.\n3. The blimfet is the only major bafwidger, so if the crongle doesn't bafwidge the most, then the narzil will bafwidge the most.\n\nTherefore, it is likely that the narzil will bafwidge the most if the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
