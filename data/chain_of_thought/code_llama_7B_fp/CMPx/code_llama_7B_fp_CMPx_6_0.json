    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jentil, a lomfry, and a darsal are the leading gardam suppliers this quarter. Industry analysts expect the jentil likely will sell the most gardam, followed by the lomfry, with the darsal significantly lower. These dominate gardam sales, so if the lomfry doesn\u2019t sell the most gardam, then if the jentil doesn\u2019t, the darsal will. Moreover, the jentil likely will lead gardam sales and hence the lomfry likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the jentil doesn\u2019t lead gardam sales, the darsal will?",

The jentil, lomfry, and darsal are the leading gardam suppliers this quarter.\n2. Industry analysts expect the jentil to sell the most gardam, followed by the lomfry, with the darsal significantly lower.\n3. The jentil likely will lead gardam sales and hence the lomfry likely won\u2019t.\n\nFrom the given information, we can conclude that:\n\n1. The jentil is likely to sell the most gardam.\n2. The lomfry is likely to sell less gardam than the jentil.\n3. The darsal is likely to sell less gardam than the jentil and the lomfry.\n\nNow, let's apply the information to the statement:\n\nIf the jentil doesn\u2019t lead gardam sales, then the darsal will likely sell the most gardam.\n\nIf the jentil doesn\u2019t lead gardam sales, then the darsal will likely sell more gardam than the jentil and the lomfry.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes.",
