    "user_prompt": "Suppose a stribben, a vanoon, and a jentapp are applying to rent a bondle. The owner thinks the stribben is the strongest applicant, followed by the vanoon, while the jentapp seems much less qualified to rent a bondle. Since these are the only applicants, if the vanoon isn\u2019t selected, then if the stribben isn\u2019t selected, the jentapp will be selected. Moreover, the stribben likely will be chosen and hence the vanoon likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the stribben isn\u2019t selected to rent the bondle, the jentapp will be?",

The owner thinks the stribben is the strongest applicant, followed by the vanoon, while the jentapp seems much less qualified to rent a bondle.\n2. Since these are the only applicants, if the vanoon isn\u2019t selected, then if the stribben isn\u2019t selected, the jentapp will be selected.\n3. The stribben likely will be chosen and hence the vanoon likely won\u2019t be.\n\nNow, let's consider the probability of each applicant being selected:\n\n1. The stribben is the strongest applicant, so it's likely that it will be selected.\n2. The vanoon is not as strong as the stribben, so it's less likely to be selected.\n3. The jentapp seems much less qualified to rent a bondle, so it's even less likely to be selected.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where the stribben isn't selected to rent the bondle:\n\n1. If the stribben isn't selected, then the vanoon will be selected, as it's the next most qualified applicant.\n2. Since the jentapp is much less qualified than the vanoon, it's even less likely to be selected.\n\nTherefore, if the stribben isn't selected to rent the bondle, it's likely that the jentapp will be selected, as it's the least qualified applicant.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
