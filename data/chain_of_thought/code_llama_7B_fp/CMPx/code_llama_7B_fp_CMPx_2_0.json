    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect are applying for one open zulision. The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications.\n2. The jantiz is the only qualified applicant who has not yet been selected for the zulision.\n3. The cramen has not yet been selected for the zulision, but is still a qualified applicant.\n4. The sulect has not yet been selected for the zulision, and is the only qualified applicant who has not yet been selected.\n5. If the cramen does not get the zulision, then the sulect will.\n6. If the jantiz does not get the zulision, then the sulect will.\n7. The jantiz is likely to get the zulision, as it is the most qualified applicant.\n8. The cramen is less likely to get the zulision, as it is the second most qualified applicant.\n9. The sulect is the least qualified applicant, and is therefore the least likely to get the zulision.\n\nTherefore, it is likely that, if the jantiz does not get the zulision, the sulect will.",
