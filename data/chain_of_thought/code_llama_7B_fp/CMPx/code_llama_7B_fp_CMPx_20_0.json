    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trundle, a foopet, and a crangor are likely to be the top selling whippits. The trundle will likely be #1 in sales, followed closely by the foopet, with the crangor having significantly lower expected sales. These lead whippit sales, so if the foopet isn\u2019t the top seller, then if the trundle isn\u2019t, the crangor will be. Moreover, the trundle likely will lead sales and hence the foopet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trundle isn\u2019t the top selling whippit, the crangor will be?",

The foopet is likely to be the second best selling whippit.\n3. The crangor has significantly lower expected sales.\n4. The trundle will likely lead sales.\n5. The foopet likely won\u2019t.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where the trundle isn't the top selling whippit. In this case, the foopet will likely be the top selling whippit, as it is likely to have higher expected sales than the crangor.\n\nTherefore, it can be inferred that if the trundle isn't the top selling whippit, the crangor will be the second best selling whippit.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
