    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantole, a dribban, and a cruggit are the most downloaded fillip apps this month. Market watchers expect the fantole likely will retain the top spot in downloads, followed by the dribban, with the cruggit download rate significantly lower. These lead the downloads, so if the dribban isn\u2019t the most downloaded, then if the fantole isn\u2019t, the cruggit will be. Moreover, the fantole likely will lead downloads and hence the dribban likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fantole isn\u2019t the most downloaded, the cruggit will be?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"it's likely that, if the fantole isn't the most downloaded, the cruggit will be\" can be logically inferred from the given information.\n\nFirstly, the fantole is expected to retain the top spot in downloads, followed by the dribban, with the cruggit download rate significantly lower. This means that the fantole is likely to lead downloads, and the dribban is likely to follow.\n\nSecondly, if the fantole isn't the most downloaded, then it's likely that the dribban won't be either. This is because the fantole is expected to lead downloads, and the dribban is likely to follow.\n\nFinally, if the fantole isn't the most downloaded, then it's likely that the cruggit will be. This is because the cruggit download rate is significantly lower than the fantole and dribban, and the fantole is expected to lead downloads.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
