The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Sue chose pizza) is true, then the consequent (Bob must have chosen pasta) must also be true. However, the second premise is a possibility that Bob might not have chosen pasta, which means that the consequent (Bob must have chosen pasta) is not necessarily true. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion (Sue did not choose pizza) is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: No.",
