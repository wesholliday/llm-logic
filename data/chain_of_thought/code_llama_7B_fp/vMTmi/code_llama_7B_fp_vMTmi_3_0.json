The argument is based on a conditional statement, which means that the conclusion follows from the premises only if they are true. In this case, the premises are \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel\" and \"The book might not be a mystery novel\". The conclusion is \"The book was not written by James\".\n\nThe problem with this argument is that the second premise is not necessarily true. Just because the book might not be a mystery novel, it does not mean that it was not written by James. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
