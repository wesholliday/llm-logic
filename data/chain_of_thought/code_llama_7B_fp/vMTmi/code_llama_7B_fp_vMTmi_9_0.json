The argument is based on a conditional statement, which means that the conclusion follows from the premises if the premises are true. However, the argument contains a possible counterexample, which is the second premise. The second premise states that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, which means that it is possible that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, even if Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nIf Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then the conclusion that Lisa did not buy the red shirt is not necessarily true. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
