The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the condition in the if-clause is true. In this case, the condition is that the apple is red. The second premise is a possibility that the banana is not yellow.\n\nThe conclusion is that the apple was not red. However, this conclusion does not follow logically from the premises. If the apple was not red, then it is possible that the banana was not yellow, even if the second premise states that the banana might not have been yellow. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
