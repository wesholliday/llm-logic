The conclusion does not follow from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad. This is a conditional statement, which means that the conclusion (Kate must have eaten salad) follows from the assumption (Ben ate pasta).\n\nThe second premise states that Kate might not have eaten salad. This is a possibility that is not necessarily true.\n\nThe conclusion states that Ben did not eat pasta. This conclusion does not follow from the premises. If Ben did not eat pasta, then it is possible that Kate did not eat salad, even if Kate might not have eaten salad.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid.",
