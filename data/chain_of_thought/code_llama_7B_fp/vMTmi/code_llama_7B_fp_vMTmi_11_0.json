The argument is based on a conditional statement, which means that the conclusion follows from the premises only if the premises are true. However, the second premise is a possibility that the muffins might not have been blueberry, which means that the conclusion is not necessarily true. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
