The conclusion does not follow from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This is a conditional statement, which means that the conclusion follows from the premise if the condition is true. However, the second premise states that Lucy might not have gone to the zoo. This is a possibility that is not ruled out by the first premise. Therefore, the conclusion that Joe did not go to the park does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
