The argument is based on a conditional statement, which means that the conclusion follows from the premises only if the premises are true. However, the argument is not consistent with the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den. This means that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den. However, the second premise states that the wolf might not have been in the den. This means that the wolf might not have been in the den, even if the bear was in the cave.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because it is based on a conditional statement that is not necessarily true. The conclusion, that the bear was not in the cave, is not necessarily true even if the premises are true.\n\nAnswer: No.",
