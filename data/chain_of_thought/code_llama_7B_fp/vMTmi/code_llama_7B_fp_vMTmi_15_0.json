The argument is based on a conditional statement, which means that the conclusion follows from the premises only if the premises are true. However, the second premise is a possibility that Erin did not take a train, which means that the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
