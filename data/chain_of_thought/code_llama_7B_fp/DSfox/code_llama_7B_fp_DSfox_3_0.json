This means that the splat is not in the state of being quanked.\n\nNext, we can use the given information, 'Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed', to infer that the splat is either quanked or morphed. Since we have already eliminated the possibility that the splat is quanked, we can conclude that the splat must be morphed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the splat is morphed from the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
