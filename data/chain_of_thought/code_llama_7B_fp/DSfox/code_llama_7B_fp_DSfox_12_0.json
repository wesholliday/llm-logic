If the smip is not lupped, then it cannot be shripped, as the two concepts are mutually exclusive.\n\nSecond, we can infer that the smip is shripped by considering the second premise. If the smip is either lupped or shripped, then it must be shripped, as the two concepts are exhaustive.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the smip is shripped based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
