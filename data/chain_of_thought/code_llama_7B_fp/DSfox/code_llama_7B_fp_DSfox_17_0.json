Either the flob is movated or it is skizzled.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The flob is skizzled,\" we need to use logical reasoning to connect the given premises.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the flob is movated, since the first premise states that it is not movated. This means that the flob must be skizzled.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The flob is skizzled\" can be inferred from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
