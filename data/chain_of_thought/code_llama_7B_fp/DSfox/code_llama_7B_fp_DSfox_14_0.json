This means that the clug is indeed snugged.\n\nNext, we can use the fact that 'Either the clug is snugged or it is fleeked' to deduce that the clug must be fleeked. This is because if the clug is snugged, then it cannot be fleeked, and if the clug is fleeked, then it must be snugged or fleeked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The clug is fleeked' from 'The clug is not snugged' together with 'Either the clug is snugged or it is fleeked'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
