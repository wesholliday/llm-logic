'The sneg is not sproted' means that the sneg is not sprouted, which means it is not yet sprouted. 'Either the sneg is sproted or it is crampled' means that either the sneg is sprouted or it is crushed.\n\nNow, let's apply the principles of deduction to the given statements. If the sneg is not sprouted, then it is either sprouted or crushed. Therefore, we can infer that the sneg is crushed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
