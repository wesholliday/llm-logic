'The fleeg is not surned' means that the fleeg is not surged, which means that it is not lifted up or moved. 'Either the fleeg is surned or it is bluttered' means that either the fleeg is surged or it is bluttered, which means that it is either lifted up or moved.\n\nNow, let's apply the principles of deduction to the given statements. If 'The fleeg is not surned', then it cannot be bluttered, because if it were bluttered, it would be surged. Therefore, if 'The fleeg is not surned', then 'The fleeg is bluttered'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
