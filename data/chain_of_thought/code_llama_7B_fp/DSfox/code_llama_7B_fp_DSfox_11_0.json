This means that \"The flug is zimmed\" must be true.\n\nNext, we can use the second premise to deduce that \"Either the flug is zimmed or it is blummed.\" This means that \"The flug is blummed\" must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The flug is blummed\" from \"The flug is not zimmed\" together with \"Either the flug is zimmed or it is blummed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
