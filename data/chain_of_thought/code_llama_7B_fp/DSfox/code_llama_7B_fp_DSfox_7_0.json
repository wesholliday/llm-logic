This means that 'The whiffle is not tinked' is true, and 'The whiffle is tinked' is false.\n\nNext, we can use the given premise 'Either the whiffle is tinked or it is shanked' to deduce that 'The whiffle is shanked'. This is because if 'The whiffle is tinked', then 'The whiffle is not shanked' (since 'The whiffle is not tinked'), which contradicts the given premise. Therefore, if 'The whiffle is not tinked', then 'The whiffle is shanked'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The whiffle is shanked' from 'The whiffle is not tinked' together with 'Either the whiffle is tinked or it is shanked'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
