This means that if the wug is not garpled, it must be sproinged.\n\nThe second premise states that it is not the case that the wug must be garpled. This means that the wug must not be garpled, which means that it must be sproinged.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
