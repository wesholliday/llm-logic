It's not the case that the smip must be lupped.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The smip is shripped,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the premises and the conclusion. The premises are:\n\n1. Either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped.\n2. It's not the case that the smip must be lupped.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n3. The smip is shripped.\n\nNow, we need to apply the rules of inference to derive the conclusion from the premises.\n\nOne possible rule of inference is Modus Ponens, which states that if a sentence of the form \"If p, then q\" is true and \"p\" is true, then \"q\" is true.\n\nUsing Modus Ponens, we can derive the conclusion \"The smip is shripped\" from the premises \"Either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped\" and \"It's not the case that the smip must be lupped.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes.",
