This statement is a tautology, which means that it is always true.\n\nSecondly, 'It's not the case that the clug must be snugged' means that it is not the case that the clug must be snugged. This statement is a contradiction, which means that it is always false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The clug is fleeked' is always true, regardless of whether the clug is snugged or fleeked. This is because the first statement is a tautology, and the second statement is a contradiction. Therefore, the third statement is also a tautology, which means that it is always true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
