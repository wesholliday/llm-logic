It's not the case that the dreb must be spent.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The dreb is vroombed,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the negation in the second premise. The negation is \"It's not the case that the dreb must be spent.\" This means that the statement \"The dreb must be spent\" is true.\n\nNext, we need to identify the biconditional in the first premise. The biconditional is \"Either the dreb must be spent or it is vroombed.\" This means that if the dreb must be spent, then it is vroombed.\n\nNow, we can use the rules of inference to infer the conclusion. We can use the law of excluded middle to infer that either the dreb must be spent or it is vroombed. Since the negation of the second premise is true, we can infer that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
