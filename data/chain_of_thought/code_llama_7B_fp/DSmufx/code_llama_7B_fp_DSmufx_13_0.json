It's not the case that the glip must be tragged.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The glip is slogged,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given statements.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the glip must be tragged by using the second statement. If the glip must be tragged, then the first statement would be false, which contradicts the fact that the first statement is true. Therefore, we can conclude that the glip is not tragged.\n\nNext, we can infer that the glip is slogged because if the glip is not tragged, then it must be slogged. This is because the first statement states that either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged, and we have already determined that the glip is not tragged. Therefore, we can conclude that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
