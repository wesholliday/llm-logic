This means that if the sprocket is not daggled, it must be cranked.\n\nThe second premise states that it is not the case that the sprocket must be daggled. This means that if the sprocket is not daggled, it is not the case that it must be daggled.\n\nBased on these premises, we can infer that if the sprocket is not daggled, it is cranked. Therefore, the conclusion \"The sprocket is cranked\" can be logically inferred.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
