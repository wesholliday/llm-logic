It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The whiffle is shanked,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the negation in the second premise. The negation is \"It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked.\" This means that the whiffle must not be tinked.\n\nNext, we need to consider the first premise. The first premise states that either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked. This means that if the whiffle is not tinked, it must be shanked.\n\nNow, we can use the negation in the second premise to infer that the whiffle is not tinked. Therefore, the whiffle must be shanked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
