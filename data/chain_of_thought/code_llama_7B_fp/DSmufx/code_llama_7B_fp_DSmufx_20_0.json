We need to use the first premise to infer the second premise, and then use the second premise to infer the conclusion.\n\nUsing the first premise, we can infer that \"the fleeg is bluttered\" if \"the fleeg must be surned.\" This means that if the fleeg must be surned, then it must be bluttered.\n\nUsing the second premise, we can infer that \"the fleeg is not surned\" if \"it is not the case that the fleeg must be surned.\" This means that if it is not the case that the fleeg must be surned, then it must not be surned.\n\nNow, let's combine these two inferences to arrive at the conclusion. If the fleeg is not surned, then it must be bluttered. Therefore, the conclusion is \"The fleeg is bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
