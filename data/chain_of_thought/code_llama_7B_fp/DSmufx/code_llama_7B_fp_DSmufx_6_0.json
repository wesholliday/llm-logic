It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The grommet is sploffed,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the type of inference we can make from the given premises. In this case, we can use a conditional inference, which is a type of logical inference that allows us to draw a conclusion based on the relationship between two premises.\n\nNext, we need to determine whether the conclusion we want to draw is logically possible based on the premises. In this case, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed because the first premise states that either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed, and the second premise states that it is not the case that the grommet must be plopped.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The grommet is sploffed\" is logically possible based on the given premises, and we can infer it.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
