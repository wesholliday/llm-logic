This means that if the flugel is not zargled, it must be blimmed.\n\nThe second premise states that it is not the case that the flugel must be zargled. This means that the flugel must not be zargled, which means that it must be blimmed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
