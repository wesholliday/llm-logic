We need to use the first premise to infer the second premise, and then use the second premise to infer the conclusion.\n\nUsing the first premise, we can infer that \"the flob is skizzled\" or \"the flob must be movated.\" If the flob is skizzled, then it is not necessary to move it. If the flob must be moved, then it is already skizzled.\n\nUsing the second premise, we can infer that \"the flob must be movated\" is not true. This means that the flob is not necessary to be moved.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"the flob is skizzled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
