It's not the case that the twonk must be plinked.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The twonk is varnished,\" we need to use logical reasoning to connect the given premises.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the twonk must be plinked, since the second premise states that it is not the case that the twonk must be plinked. This means that the twonk must be varnished, since the first premise states that either the twonk must be varnished or it is plinked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
