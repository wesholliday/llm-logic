However, this does not necessarily mean that the conclusion implies the premise.\n\nFor example, if the flob was skizzled and then it moved, then it is possible that it was not skizzled before it moved. In this case, the conclusion (the flob movated) is true, but the premise (the flob was skizzled) is not true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the flob movated, then the flob was skizzled.\n\nAnswer: No.",
