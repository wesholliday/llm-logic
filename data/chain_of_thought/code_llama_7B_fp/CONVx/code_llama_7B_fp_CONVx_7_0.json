The statement is a riddle, and the answer is \"no\" because the two statements are not logically equivalent.\n\nIf the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked, but this does not necessarily mean that if the whiffle tinked, then the whiffle was shanked. The two statements are not equivalent because the first statement implies that the whiffle was shanked, while the second statement only implies that the whiffle tinked.\n\nAnswer: No.",
