This means that the morphing of the splat caused the splat to quank.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"If the splat quanked, then the splat was morphed\". This statement is the opposite of the first statement, and it implies that the quanking of the splat led to its morphing.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer the second statement from the first statement, we need to analyze the meaning of each statement and determine whether they are logically consistent.\n\nThe first statement asserts that the morphing of the splat led to its quanking. This means that the morphing of the splat caused the splat to quank.\n\nThe second statement asserts that the quanking of the splat led to its morphing. This means that the quanking of the splat caused the splat to be morphed.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can see that the two statements are logically inconsistent. The first statement implies that the morphing of the splat caused its quanking, while the second statement implies that the quanking of the splat caused its morphing.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first statement.",
