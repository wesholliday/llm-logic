If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\n2. The twonk was plinked.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n3. If the twonk was varnished, then it was plinked.\n\nHowever, this conclusion is not necessarily true. The twonk may have been varnished for reasons unrelated to its being plinked. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the twonk was varnished, then it was plinked.\n\nAnswer: No.",
