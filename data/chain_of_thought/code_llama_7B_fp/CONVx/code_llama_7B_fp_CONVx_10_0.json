The statement is not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a rhetorical device to create a sense of confusion or paradox.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first one. The two statements are not logically connected, and the use of homophones in the first statement does not imply the second statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
