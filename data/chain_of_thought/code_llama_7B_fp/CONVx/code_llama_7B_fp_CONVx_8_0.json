This is because the word \"then\" in the statement implies a causal relationship between the two events.\n\nHowever, the statement \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was cranked\" is a different logical implication, which means that if the sprocket was daggled, then it must have been cranked. This is because the word \"then\" in the statement implies a causal relationship between the two events.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was cranked\" from \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\", but we cannot infer \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" from \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was cranked\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
