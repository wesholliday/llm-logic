The syllogism is structured as follows:\n\n1. If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\n2. If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was vreebled.\n\nTo infer the second statement from the first, we need to use the principle of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot both be true and false at the same time. In this case, if the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged, and if the smonk plagged, then the smonk was vreebled. Therefore, we can infer that if the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged, and if the smonk plagged, then the smonk was vreebled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
