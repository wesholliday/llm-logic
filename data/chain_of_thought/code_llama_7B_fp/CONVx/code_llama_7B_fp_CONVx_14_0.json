The first sentence \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\" means that if the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\n\nThe second sentence \"If the clug snugged, then the clug was fleeked\" means that if the clug snugged, then the clug was fleeked.\n\nNow, we can see that the two sentences are logically equivalent. If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged, and if the clug snugged, then the clug was fleeked. Therefore, we can infer that \"If the clug snugged, then the clug was fleeked.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
