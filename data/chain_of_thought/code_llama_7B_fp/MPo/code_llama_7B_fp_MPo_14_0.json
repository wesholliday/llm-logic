If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The wolf was in the den,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the meaning of the given premises. The first premise states that the bear was in the cave, and the second premise states that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of inference to the given premises. We can use the premise \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" to infer the conclusion \"The wolf was in the den.\" This is known as a conditional inference, where we can infer the conclusion from the premise based on the condition stated in the premise.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes, we can infer the conclusion \"The wolf was in the den\" from the given premises.",
