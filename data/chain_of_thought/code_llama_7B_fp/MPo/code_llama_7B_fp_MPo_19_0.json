            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer that Jen watched basketball, we need to use the premises given in the question. The first premise is \"Tom watched football,\" and the second premise is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nTo infer that Jen watched basketball, we need to use the conditional statement in the second premise. The conditional statement states that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This means that if Tom watched football, then there must be a reason why Jen watched basketball.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Jen watched basketball because Tom watched football. This is supported by the first premise, which states that Tom watched football.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
