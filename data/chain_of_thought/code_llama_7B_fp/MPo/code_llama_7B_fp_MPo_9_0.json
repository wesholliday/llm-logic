Premise 1: Lisa bought the red shirt.\n2. Premise 2: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n3. Inference: Therefore, Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nThe inference is valid because the premises are logically connected.

Therefore, we can infer that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
