If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n\nTo infer whether Sue was at the wedding, we need to consider the relationship between Mary and Sue. If Mary was at the wedding, then it is likely that Sue was also at the wedding, since the statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" implies a causal relationship between the two events. However, we cannot be certain without additional information.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
