If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The mummy was awake,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the meaning of \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This statement means that if the vampire was awake, then it logically follows that the mummy was also awake.\n\nNext, we need to consider the first premise, \"The vampire was awake.\" This means that the vampire was indeed awake.\n\nNow, we can use the second premise to infer the conclusion. Since the vampire was awake, and the vampire implies the mummy, then it logically follows that the mummy was also awake.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the conclusion \"The mummy was awake\" based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
