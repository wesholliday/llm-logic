            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer \"The unicorn was in the forest\" from \"The griffin was in the forest\" together with \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the principle of non-contradiction.\n\n1. The premises are:\n\t* The griffin was in the forest.\n\t* If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n2. The conclusion we want to draw is:\n\t* The unicorn was in the forest.\n\nTo draw this conclusion, we need to use the premises to logically deduce the conclusion. We can do this by using the principle of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time.\n\n3. We can start by assuming that the conclusion is false, which means that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n4. Since the griffin was in the forest, and the unicorn was not in the forest, we can conclude that the statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" is false.\n5. This means that the premise \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" is not true, which contradicts our assumption that the conclusion is false.\n6. Therefore, we have reached a logical contradiction, which means that our assumption that the conclusion is false was incorrect.\n7. Therefore, we can conclude that the conclusion \"The unicorn was in the forest\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
