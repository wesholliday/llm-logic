If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The truck was metal,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the meaning of the given premises. The first premise states that the doll was plastic, and the second premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nNow, let's analyze the second premise. It states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. This means that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must be metal, because the second premise implies that the truck is metal if the doll is plastic.\n\nSo, if the doll was plastic, then the truck must be metal. This is the conclusion we can draw from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
