In this case, the condition is that Joe went to the park. If Joe went to the park, then it is likely that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Lucy went to the zoo based on the information that Joe went to the park and that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
