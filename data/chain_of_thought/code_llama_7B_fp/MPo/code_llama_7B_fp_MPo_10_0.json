If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n\nTo infer \"The cat was outside,\" we need to use logical reasoning to draw a conclusion from the given premises.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the meaning of the given premises. The first premise states that the dog was inside, and the second premise states that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of inference to draw a conclusion.
