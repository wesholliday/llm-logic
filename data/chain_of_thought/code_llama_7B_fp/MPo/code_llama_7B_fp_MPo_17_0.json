The first premise is \"Ben ate pasta,\" and the second premise is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\"\n\nTo infer Kate ate the salad, we need to use the conditional statement in the second premise. The conditional statement is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\" This means that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\n\nNow, we need to see if the first premise is true. If the first premise is true, then we can infer that Kate ate the salad. So, we need to ask ourselves if Ben ate pasta.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
