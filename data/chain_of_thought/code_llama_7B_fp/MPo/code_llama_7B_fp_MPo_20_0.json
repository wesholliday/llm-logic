If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nTo infer the conclusion that the banana was yellow, we need to use logical reasoning. We can do this by applying the principle of modus ponens, which states that if a conditional statement is true, then the conclusion of the conditional statement is also true.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" If this statement is true, then the conclusion \"The banana was yellow\" must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the banana was yellow based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
