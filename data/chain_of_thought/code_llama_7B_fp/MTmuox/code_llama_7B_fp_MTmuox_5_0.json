This means that the zinger must not have been smoogled, which implies that it was not fraggled.\n\nSecond, if the zinger was fraggled, then it must have been smoogled by the second statement. This means that the zinger was fraggled, which contradicts our initial assumption that it was not fraggled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The zinger was not fraggled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
