If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have moved.\n\nTo infer \"The flob was not skizzled,\" we need to use logical reasoning to deduce the conclusion from the given premises.\n\nStep 1: Negate the first premise to get the conclusion.\n\n1. It's not the case that the flob must have moved.\n2. If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have moved.\n\nStep 2: Apply the conditional statement to the second premise to get the conclusion.\n\n1. It's not the case that the flob must have moved.\n2. If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have moved.\n\nStep 3: Negate the second premise to get the conclusion.\n\n1. It's not the case that the flob must have moved.\n2. If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have moved.\n\nStep 4: Apply the negation to the conclusion to get the final answer.\n\n1. It's not the case that the flob must have moved.\n2. If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have moved.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
