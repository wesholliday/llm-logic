If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The flugel was not blimmed,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the conclusion that we want to draw from the given premises. In this case, the conclusion is \"The flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\nNext, we need to determine whether the conclusion can be logically inferred from the premises. To do this, we need to use the rules of inference, such as modus tollens (MT) and modus ponens (MP).\n\nUsing MT, we can infer that if the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled. Therefore, if the flugel was not blimmed, then it must not have been zargled.\n\nUsing MP, we can infer that if the flugel must have been zargled, then it must have been blimmed. Therefore, if the flugel was not blimmed, then it must not have been zargled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the conclusion \"The flugel was not blimmed\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
