'It's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned' means that it is not necessarily true that the fleeg must have been surned. 'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned' means that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of logic to the given premises. We need to use the principle of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time.\n\nIf the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned. This means that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned, and therefore, it cannot be the case that the fleeg must have been surned.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The fleeg was not bluttered' from 'It's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned' together with 'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
