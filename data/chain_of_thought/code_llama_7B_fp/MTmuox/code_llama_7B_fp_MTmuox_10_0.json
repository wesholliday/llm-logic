If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The wug was not sproinged,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the wug was garpled by the first premise. This means that the wug was not garpled, and therefore, it cannot be sproonged.\n\nSecond, we can infer that the wug was not sproonged by the second premise. This is because if the wug was sproonged, then it must have been garpled, and we have already established that the wug was not garpled. Therefore, the wug was not sproonged.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the wug was not sproonged.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
