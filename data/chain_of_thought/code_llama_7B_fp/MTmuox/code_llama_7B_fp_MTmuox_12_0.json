If the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The smip was not shripped,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the smip was shripped by considering the first premise. If the smip was shripped, then it would have lupped the zoint, which is not the case. Therefore, we can conclude that the smip was not shripped.\n\nSecond, we can use the second premise to further support our conclusion. If the smip was not shripped, then it must have lupped the zoint, which is not the case. Therefore, we can conclude that the smip was not shripped.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
