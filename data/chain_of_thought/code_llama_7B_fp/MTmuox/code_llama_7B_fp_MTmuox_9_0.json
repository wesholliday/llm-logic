If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The twonk was not plinked,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the twonk was varnished by the first premise. This means that the twonk must not have been varnished.\n\nSecond, if the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished by the second premise. This means that the twonk was plinked and was therefore varnished.\n\nHowever, we have already established that the twonk was not varnished in the first premise. Therefore, we can conclude that the twonk was not plinked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
