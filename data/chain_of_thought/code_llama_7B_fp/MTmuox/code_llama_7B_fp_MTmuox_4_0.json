If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The fribble was not snurgled,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the negation in the first premise. The negation is \"It's not the case that the fribble must have crinked.\" This means that the fribble must not have crinked.\n\nNext, we need to identify the conditional statement in the second premise. The conditional statement is \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked.\" This means that if the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked.\n\nNow, we need to use the rules of inference to draw the conclusion. We can use the rule of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time.\n\nTherefore, if the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked. But if the fribble must not have crinked, then it cannot have been snurgled. This means that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
