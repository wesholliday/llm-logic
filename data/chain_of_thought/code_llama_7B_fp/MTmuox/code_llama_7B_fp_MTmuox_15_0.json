If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spent.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The dreb was not vroombed,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the meaning of the given premises. \"It's not the case that the dreb must have been spent\" means that it is not necessarily true that the dreb must have been spent. \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spent\" means that if the dreb was vroombed, then it must have been spent.\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of inference to the given premises. We can use the rule of non-contradiction to infer that \"The dreb was not vroombed\" (contradiction between the premises \"The dreb was vroombed\" and \"The dreb must have been spent\").\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The dreb was not vroombed\" can be inferred from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
