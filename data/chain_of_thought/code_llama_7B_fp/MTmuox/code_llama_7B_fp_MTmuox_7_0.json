If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The whiffle was not shanked,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the negation in the first premise. The negation is \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have tinked.\" This means that the whiffle must not have tinked.\n\nNext, we need to identify the conditional statement in the second premise. The conditional statement is \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked.\" This means that if the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked.\n\nNow, we need to use the rules of inference to draw a conclusion. We can use the following rule:\n\nIf A is not true, and B is true, then C is not true.\n\nIn this case, A is \"The whiffle must not have tinked,\" which is the negation of the first premise. B is \"The whiffle was shanked,\" which is the conditional statement in the second premise. C is \"The whiffle was not shanked,\" which is the conclusion we want to draw.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the conclusion \"The whiffle was not shanked\" based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
