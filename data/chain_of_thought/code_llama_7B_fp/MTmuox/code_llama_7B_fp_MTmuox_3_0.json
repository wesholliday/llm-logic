If the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked, according to the second statement. However, we know that the splat was not morphed, so it must not have quanked. This contradicts the second statement, which implies that if the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked. Therefore, we can conclude that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
