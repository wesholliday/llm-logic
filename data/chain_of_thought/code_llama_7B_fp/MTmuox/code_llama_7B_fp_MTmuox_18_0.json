If the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The shank was not plooked,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the meaning of the given premises. \"It's not the case that the shank must have been nugged\" means that the shank was not nugged, and \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged\" means that if the shank was plooked, then it must have been nugged.\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of inference to the given premises. We can use the rule of non-contradiction to infer that \"The shank was not plooked\" (contradiction between premises 1 and 2).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The shank was not plooked\" can be inferred from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
