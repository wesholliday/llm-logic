If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged.\n\nTo infer 'The glip was not slogged', we need to use logical reasoning to deduce the conclusion from the given premises.\n\nStep 1: Negate the first premise to get the conclusion.\n\n1. It's not the case that the glip must have tragged.\n2. If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged.\n\nStep 2: Apply the conditional statement to the second premise to get the conclusion.\n\n1. It's not the case that the glip must have tragged.\n2. If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged.\n\nStep 3: Negate the second premise to get the conclusion.\n\n1. It's not the case that the glip must have tragged.\n2. If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged.\n\nStep 4: Apply the negation to the conclusion to get the final answer.\n\n1.
