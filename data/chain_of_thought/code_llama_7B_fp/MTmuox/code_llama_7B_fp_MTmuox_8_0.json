If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The sprocket was not cranked,\" we need to use logical reasoning.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the sprocket was cranked by using the first premise. If the sprocket was not cranked, then it must have been daggled, which contradicts the second premise. Therefore, we can conclude that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
