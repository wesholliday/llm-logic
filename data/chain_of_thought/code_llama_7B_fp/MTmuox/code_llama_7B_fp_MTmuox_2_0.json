If the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint.\n\nTo infer \"The wug was not flooped,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the wug was flooped by considering the second premise. If the wug was flooped, then it must have bimmed the zoint, which contradicts the first premise. Therefore, we can conclude that the wug was not flooped.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
