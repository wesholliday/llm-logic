This is a classic example of a disjunctive syllogism, where the conclusion is that A or C must be true, but not necessarily both. The original statement does not imply that the plonk must be on either wibble or shimble, but rather that if it is on wibble, then it must be on shimble as well. \n\nAnswer: no"
