The griffin was in the forest.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The unicorn was in the forest,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the meaning of the first premise. It states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was also in the forest. This means that if the griffin is present in the forest, then it is likely that the unicorn is also present in the forest.\n\nSecond, we need to understand the meaning of the second premise. It simply states that the griffin was in the forest. This means that the griffin is present in the forest.\n\nNow, we can use the first premise to infer the conclusion. If the griffin is present in the forest, then it is likely that the unicorn is also present in the forest. Therefore, we can infer that the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
