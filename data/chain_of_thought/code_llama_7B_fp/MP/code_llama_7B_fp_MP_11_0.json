In this case, the premise is \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" and the conclusion is \"The muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer the conclusion from the premise, we need to evaluate the validity of the argument. An argument is valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the argument is valid because the premise \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is true, and the conclusion \"The muffins were blueberry\" is also true. Therefore, we can infer the conclusion from the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
