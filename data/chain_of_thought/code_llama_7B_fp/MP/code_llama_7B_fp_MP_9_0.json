Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nTo infer whether Mark bought the blue shirt, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the consequent (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the antecedent is true (Lisa bought the red shirt), so we can infer that Mark bought the blue shirt. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
