In this case, the relationship is that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n\nTo infer whether Erin took a train, we need to consider the information provided in the statement. The statement says that Sam took a plane, and that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. This means that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train, but it does not necessarily mean that Erin took a train.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Erin took a train based on the information provided in the statement. We need to consider additional information or evidence to make a conclusion about Erin's mode of transportation.\n\nAnswer: No.",
