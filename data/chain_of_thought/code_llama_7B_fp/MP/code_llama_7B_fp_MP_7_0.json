Alex finished the race.\n\nTo infer whether Chris finished the race, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements. The first statement implies that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This means that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race as well.\n\nNow, we have the second statement, which is that Alex finished the race. This means that Alex did finish the race.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Chris finished the race as well, since if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race as well.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
