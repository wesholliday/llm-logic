The bear was in the cave.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The wolf was in the den,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the meaning of the given premises. The first premise states that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. This means that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den, but it does not necessarily mean that the bear was in the cave.\n\nThe second premise states that the bear was in the cave. This means that the bear was in the cave, but it does not necessarily mean that the wolf was in the den.\n\nNow, let's use the given premises to infer the conclusion. If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. This means that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. But we already know that the bear was in the cave, so we can infer that the wolf was in the den.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The wolf was in the den\" can be inferred from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
