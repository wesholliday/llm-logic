This means that if there is evidence that Joe went to the park, then there is also evidence that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nNow, let's consider the given information: \"Joe went to the park.\" This means that Joe did indeed go to the park.\n\nBased on the information provided, we can infer that Lucy went to the zoo. This is because the statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy also went to the zoo. Since we know that Joe went to the park, we can conclude that Lucy also went to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
