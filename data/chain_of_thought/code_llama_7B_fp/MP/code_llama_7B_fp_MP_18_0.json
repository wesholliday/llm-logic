            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" implies that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. This is because the statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the condition stated in the \"if\" clause is true. In this case, the condition is that the doll is plastic.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"The doll was plastic\". This statement is true, and it means that the doll is indeed plastic.\n\nSo, we have two statements: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" and \"The doll was plastic\". If we combine these two statements, we can infer that the truck must be metal, because the first statement implies that the truck is metal if the doll is plastic. And we know that the doll is plastic, so we can conclude that the truck must be metal.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
