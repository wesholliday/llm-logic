            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that expresses a relationship between two conditions. In this case, the first condition is \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" The second condition is \"Jeff played basketball.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that Amy played tennis, we need to evaluate the validity of the conditional statement. The conditional statement is valid if the antecedent (the condition before the \"then\") is true and the consequent (the condition after the \"then\") is true.\n\nIn this case, the antecedent is \"Jeff played basketball,\" which is a true statement. Therefore, the conditional statement is valid.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate whether the consequent is true. The consequent is \"Amy played tennis.\" We don't have any information about Amy's playing habits, so we can't say for sure whether she played tennis or not. However, since the antecedent is true, we can infer that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes. We can infer that Amy played tennis based on the given information.",
