Mary was at the wedding.\n\nTo infer whether Sue was at the wedding, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements. The first statement implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. The second statement states that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Sue was at the wedding because the first statement implies that Sue was at the wedding if Mary was at the wedding. Since Mary was at the wedding, we can conclude that Sue was also at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
