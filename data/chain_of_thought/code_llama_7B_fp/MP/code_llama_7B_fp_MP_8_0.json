The vampire was awake.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The mummy was awake,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the meaning of \"if\" in the first premise. It means that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was also awake. This means that the mummy was awake because the vampire was awake.\n\nSecond, we need to understand the meaning of \"the vampire was awake.\" This means that the vampire was not asleep.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the mummy was awake because the vampire was awake, and the vampire was not asleep.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
