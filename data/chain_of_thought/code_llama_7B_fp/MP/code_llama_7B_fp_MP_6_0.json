Sue chose pizza.\n\nTo infer whether Bob chose pasta or not, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements. The first statement implies that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. This means that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta as well.\n\nNow, we have the second statement, which is that Sue chose pizza. This means that Sue did not choose pasta, since the first statement implies that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. Therefore, we can infer that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: No.",
