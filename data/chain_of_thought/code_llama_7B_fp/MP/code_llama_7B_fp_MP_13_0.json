The car was red.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the truck was blue, we need to follow the rules of logical inference.\n\nFirst, we need to determine whether the premises are true or false.\n\n1. If the car was red, then the truck was blue. (Premise)\n2. The car was red. (Premise)\n\nBoth premises are true, so we can proceed with the logical inference.\n\nNext, we need to determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nConclusion: The truck was blue.\n\nTo determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises, we need to use the rules of logical deduction.\n\nRule of logical deduction: If a statement follows logically from a set of premises, and all the premises are true, then the conclusion is also true.\n\nIn this case, the conclusion \"The truck was blue\" follows logically from the premises \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" and \"The car was red.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the truck was blue.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
