The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch. This premise is a disjunction, which means that it is true if either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch.\n\nThe second premise states that the remote control might not be hiding under the couch. This premise is a possibility, but it does not necessarily mean that the remote control is not hiding under the couch.\n\nThe conclusion states that the remote control is on the coffee table. This conclusion is not logically implied by the premises. It is possible that the remote control is not on the coffee table, but rather it is hiding under the couch.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid.",
