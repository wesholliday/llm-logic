The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden. This premise is a tautology, as it is always true that Fido is either inside or in the garden.\n\nThe second premise states that Fido might not be in the garden. This premise is a possibility, but it does not logically follow from the first premise. It is possible that Fido is not in the garden even if Fido is inside.\n\nThe conclusion states that Fido is inside. This conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. It is possible that Fido is not inside, even if Fido might be in the garden.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid.",
