The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head. This is a tautology, as it is possible for the sunglasses to be in her bag and still be perched on her head.\n\nThe second premise states that the sunglasses might not be perched on her head. This is a possibility that is not explicitly ruled out by the first premise.\n\nThe conclusion states that the sunglasses are in her bag. This conclusion does not logically follow from the premises, as it is possible for the sunglasses to be perched on her head even if they are in her bag.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid.",
