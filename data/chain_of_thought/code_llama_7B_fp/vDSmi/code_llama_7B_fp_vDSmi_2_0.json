The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that the book is either on the shelf or resting on the table. This premise is a tautology, as it is a statement that is always true.\n\nThe second premise states that the book might not be resting on the table. This premise is a possibility that is not necessarily true.\n\nThe conclusion states that the book is on the shelf. This conclusion is a conclusion that is not necessarily true, as the second premise states that the book might not be resting on the table.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.",
