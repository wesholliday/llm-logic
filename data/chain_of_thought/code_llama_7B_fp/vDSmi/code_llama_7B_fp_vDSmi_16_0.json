The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the pen is in my bag, then it must be on my desk. However, the second premise states that the pen might not be on my desk. This means that the pen could be in my bag and not on my desk, which would make the first premise false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.",
