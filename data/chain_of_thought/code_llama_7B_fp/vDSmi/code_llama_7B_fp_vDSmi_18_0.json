The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that the notebook is either in the drawer or on the nightstand. The second premise states that the notebook might not be on the nightstand. However, the conclusion states that the notebook is in the drawer. This conclusion is not logically implied by the premises.\n\nTo make the argument logically valid, we would need to add a third premise that states that the notebook is not on the nightstand. This would allow us to logically deduce that the notebook is in the drawer from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
