The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry. This is a tautology, as it is impossible for the cookies to be in the jar and hidden in the pantry at the same time. Therefore, the first premise is not a valid premise.\n\nThe second premise states that the cookies might not be hidden in the pantry. This premise is not a contradiction of the first premise, as it is possible for the cookies to be in the jar and not hidden in the pantry. Therefore, the second premise is not a valid premise.\n\nThe conclusion states that the cookies are in the jar. This conclusion does not logically follow from the premises, as the first premise states that the cookies might be hidden in the pantry, and the second premise states that the cookies might not be hidden in the pantry. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
