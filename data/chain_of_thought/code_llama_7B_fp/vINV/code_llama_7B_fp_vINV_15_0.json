The conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nThe premise states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. This means that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\n\nThe conclusion states that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train. This conclusion is not necessarily true, as it is possible that Sam took a plane and Erin did not take a train.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.",
