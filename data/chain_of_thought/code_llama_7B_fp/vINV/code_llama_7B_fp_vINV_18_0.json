The conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nThe premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. This means that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. However, the conclusion states that if the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal. This means that if the doll is not plastic, then the truck is not metal, regardless of whether the doll is plastic or not.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.",
