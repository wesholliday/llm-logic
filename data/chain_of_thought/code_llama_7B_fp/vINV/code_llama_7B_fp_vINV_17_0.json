The conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nThe premise states that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. This means that if Ben did eat pasta, then Kate did eat salad. However, the conclusion states that if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad. This conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nFor the argument to be logically valid, the conclusion would need to logically follow from the premise. In this case, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise, so the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
