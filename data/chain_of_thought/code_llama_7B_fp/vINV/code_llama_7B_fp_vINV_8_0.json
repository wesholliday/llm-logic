The conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nThe premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This means that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake. However, the conclusion states that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake. This means that if the vampire is not awake, then the mummy is not awake, but this is not necessarily true.\n\nFor example, suppose the vampire is awake, but the mummy is not. In this case, the premise is true, but the conclusion is false. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
