The premise \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is not a necessary condition for the conclusion \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\" In other words, just because Sue chose pizza does not necessarily mean that Bob chose pasta.\n\nFor example, suppose Sue chose pizza because she likes pizza, but Bob chose pasta because he likes pasta. In this case, the premise is true, but the conclusion is false. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
