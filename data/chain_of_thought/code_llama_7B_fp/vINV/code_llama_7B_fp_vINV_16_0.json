The premise states that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. However, the conclusion states that if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim. This means that the conclusion is not necessarily true if the premise is false.\n\nFor example, suppose the shirt was not cotton, but the pants were still denim. This would mean that the premise is false, but the conclusion is true. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
