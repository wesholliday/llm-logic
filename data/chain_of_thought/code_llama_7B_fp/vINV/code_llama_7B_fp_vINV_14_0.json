The conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nThe premise states that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. This means that if the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.\n\nThe conclusion states that if the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den. This conclusion does not logically follow from the premise. It is possible for the bear to be in the cave and the wolf to be in the den without the bear being in the cave.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid.",
