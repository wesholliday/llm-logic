The conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nThe premise states that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This means that if Tom did watch football, then Jen did watch basketball. However, the conclusion states that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball. This means that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did watch basketball, which is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.",
