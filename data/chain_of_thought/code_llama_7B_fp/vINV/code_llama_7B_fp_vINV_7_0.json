The premise \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (Alex finishing the race) is true. However, the conclusion \"If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race\" is also a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (Alex not finishing the race) is true.\n\nHowever, the premise and conclusion are not logically equivalent. If Alex did not finish the race, it does not necessarily follow that Chris did not finish the race. There could be other factors that prevented Chris from finishing the race, such as a mechanical issue or a personal injury. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
