The conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nThe premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This means that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nThe conclusion states that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding. This conclusion is not necessarily true, as it is possible that Sue was at the wedding even if Mary was not.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.",
