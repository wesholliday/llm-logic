The premise states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. However, the conclusion states that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry. This means that the conclusion is not necessarily true if the premise is false.\n\nFor example, suppose the cake was not chocolate, but the muffins were blueberry. This would not be a contradiction of the premise, but it would be a contradiction of the conclusion. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
