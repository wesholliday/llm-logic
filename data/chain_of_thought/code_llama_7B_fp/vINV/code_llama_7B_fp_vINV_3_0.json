The conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nThe premise states that if the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. This is a conditional statement, which means that the conclusion (the book is a mystery novel) only follows from the premise if the antecedent (the book was written by James) is true.\n\nThe conclusion, on the other hand, states that if the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel. This is also a conditional statement, but the antecedent (the book was not written by James) is not necessarily true. In fact, it is possible that the book was written by James, but it is not a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.",
