The premise is a conditional statement, \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter,\" which is not necessarily true. The conclusion, \"If the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter,\" is a conditional statement as well, but it is not necessarily true.\n\nThe argument is not valid because the premise does not entail the conclusion. The premise states that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter, but it does not guarantee that the alien did not visit Mars. Similarly, the conclusion states that if the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter, but it does not guarantee that the alien did visit Mars.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.",
