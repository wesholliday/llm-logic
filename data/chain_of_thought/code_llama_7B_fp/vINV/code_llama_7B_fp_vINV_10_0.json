The conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nThe premise states that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. This means that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside, but it does not necessarily mean that if the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside.\n\nThe conclusion states that if the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside. This conclusion is not necessarily true, as the premise only states that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. It does not necessarily follow that if the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid.",
