This statement does not necessarily imply that the book was written by someone else, but rather that the authorship of the book is not certain.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the book might not have been written by James. However, this inference does not necessarily mean that the book was written by someone else, as the authorship of the book could still be uncertain.",
