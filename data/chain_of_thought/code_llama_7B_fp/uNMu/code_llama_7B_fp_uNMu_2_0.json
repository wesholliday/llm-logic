However, this does not necessarily mean that the griffin was not in the forest. It could have been in the forest, but it was not the case that it must have been there.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the griffin might not have been in the forest based on this statement alone. We need more information or context to make a conclusion about the griffin's presence in the forest.\n\nAnswer: No.",
