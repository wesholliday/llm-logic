This statement is logically equivalent to \"The scarf must not be stuffed in my backpack.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the scarf might not be stuffed in my backpack. This is because the statement \"The scarf must not be stuffed in my backpack\" is a stronger statement than \"It's not the case that the scarf must be stuffed in my backpack,\" and it implies that the scarf is not likely to be stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
