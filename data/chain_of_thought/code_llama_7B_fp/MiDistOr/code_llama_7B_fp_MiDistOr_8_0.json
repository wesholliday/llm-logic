            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a disjunction, which means it presents two possibilities: the restaurant might be closed on Mondays or it might be open for limited hours. The word \"or\" in this context is a logical disjunction, indicating that at least one of the options is true. The statement is not implying that the restaurant is closed on Mondays and open for limited hours at the same time. Therefore, we can infer that the restaurant might be closed on Mondays or it might be open for limited hours, which is essentially the same statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
