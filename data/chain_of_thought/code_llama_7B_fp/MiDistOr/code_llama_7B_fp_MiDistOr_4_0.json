            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The meeting might start at 2 PM or be cancelled\" is a disjunction, which means it presents two possibilities: either the meeting starts at 2 PM or it is cancelled. The word \"or\" in this context is a logical operator that indicates an exclusive disjunction, meaning that only one of the two possibilities can occur. The statement does not imply that the meeting might start at 2 PM and also be cancelled at the same time. Therefore, the inference \"The meeting might start at 2 PM or it might be cancelled\" is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
