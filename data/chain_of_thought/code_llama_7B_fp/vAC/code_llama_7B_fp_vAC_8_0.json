The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This means that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would also be awake. However, the second premise states that the mummy was awake, which does not necessarily mean that the vampire was awake. Therefore, the conclusion that the vampire was awake does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
