The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This means that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race, but it does not necessarily mean that Alex finished the race.\n\nThe second premise states that Chris finished the race is true. This means that Chris finished the race, but it does not necessarily mean that Alex finished the race.\n\nThe conclusion states that Alex finished the race. This means that Alex finished the race, but it does not necessarily mean that Chris finished the race.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.",
