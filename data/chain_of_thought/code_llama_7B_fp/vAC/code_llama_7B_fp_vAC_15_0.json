The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. This means that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train because of the reason that Sam took a plane.\n\nThe second premise states that Erin took a train. This means that Erin took a train for some reason.\n\nThe conclusion states that Sam took a plane. This means that Sam took a plane for some reason.\n\nThe argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The conclusion is not a necessary conclusion of the premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
