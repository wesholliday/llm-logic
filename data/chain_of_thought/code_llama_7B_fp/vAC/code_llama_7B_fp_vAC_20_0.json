The first premise, \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow,\" is a conditional statement that asserts a causal relationship between the apple's color and the banana's color. However, the second premise, \"The banana was yellow,\" does not provide any evidence to support the causal relationship between the apple's color and the banana's color.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because it relies on an unsupported assumption. To make the argument logically valid, we would need to provide evidence to support the causal relationship between the apple's color and the banana's color.\n\nAnswer: No.",
