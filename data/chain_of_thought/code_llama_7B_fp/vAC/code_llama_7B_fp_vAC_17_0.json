The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. This means that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad as well.\n\nThe second premise states that Kate ate salad. This means that Kate ate salad, regardless of whether Ben ate pasta or not.\n\nThe conclusion states that Ben ate pasta. This means that Ben ate pasta, regardless of whether Kate ate salad or not.\n\nHowever, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad, but if Kate ate salad, then Ben did not eat pasta. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
