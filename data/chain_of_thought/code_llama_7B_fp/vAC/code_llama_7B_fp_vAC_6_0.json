The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. This means that if Sue chose pizza, Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\nThe second premise states that Bob chose pasta. This means that Bob did indeed choose pasta.\n\nThe conclusion states that Sue chose pizza. This means that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. However, the second premise states that Bob chose pasta, which contradicts the conclusion. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
