The second premise states that the muffins were blueberry, but this information is not relevant to the conclusion that the cake was chocolate. The conclusion follows logically from the first premise, which states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. However, the second premise is not a necessary condition for the conclusion, and it is not logically implied by the first premise. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
