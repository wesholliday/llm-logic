The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Tom watched football) is true, then the consequent (Jen watched basketball) must also be true. However, the second premise states that Jen watched basketball, which is not necessarily related to the first premise. Therefore, the argument is not valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
