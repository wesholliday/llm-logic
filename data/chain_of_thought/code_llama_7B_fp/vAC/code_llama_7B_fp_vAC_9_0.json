The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This means that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nThe second premise states that Mark bought the blue shirt. This means that Mark bought the blue shirt, regardless of whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not.\n\nThe conclusion states that Lisa bought the red shirt. This means that Lisa bought the red shirt, regardless of whether Mark bought the blue shirt or not.\n\nHowever, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The conclusion states that Lisa bought the red shirt, but the premises do not necessarily imply that Lisa bought the red shirt. In fact, the premises suggest that Mark bought the blue shirt, which could have been bought by someone other than Lisa.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid.",
