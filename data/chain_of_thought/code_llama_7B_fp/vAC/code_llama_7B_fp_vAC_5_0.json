The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) is true, then the consequent (Amy played tennis) must also be true. However, the second premise states that Amy played tennis, which is not necessarily related to the antecedent of the conditional statement. Therefore, the argument is not valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
