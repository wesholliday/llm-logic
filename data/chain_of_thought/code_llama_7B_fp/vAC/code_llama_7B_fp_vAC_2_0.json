The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. This is a conditional statement, which means that the conclusion follows from the premise if the condition is true. However, the second premise states that the unicorn was in the forest, which is not necessarily true. Therefore, the first premise is not necessarily true, and the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
