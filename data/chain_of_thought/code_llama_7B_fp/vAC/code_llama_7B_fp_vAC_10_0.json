The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. This is a conditional statement, and it is not necessarily true that the cat was outside if the dog was inside. In fact, there are many possible scenarios in which the cat could have been outside even if the dog was inside.\n\nThe second premise states that the cat was outside. This is a factual statement, and it is not necessarily related to the first premise.\n\nThe conclusion states that the dog was inside. This is a conclusion that is not logically implied by the premises. In fact, the conclusion is the opposite of what the first premise implies. Therefore, this argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
