The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the condition stated in the antecedent is true. In this case, the antecedent is \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This statement is not necessarily true, as there are many mystery novels written by authors other than James.\n\nThe second premise is also a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the condition stated in the antecedent is true. In this case, the antecedent is \"The book is a mystery novel.\" This statement is true, as the book in question is a mystery novel.\n\nThe conclusion is \"The book was written by James.\" This statement is also true, as the book was written by James.\n\nHowever, the argument is not logically valid because the first premise is not necessarily true. The second premise is true, but the first premise is not necessarily true, as there are many mystery novels written by authors other than James. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
