The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The jacket is draped over the chair,\" we need to consider the possible combinations of the given statements.\n\nIf the jacket is draped over the chair, then it cannot be hanging in the closet, as the chair is already occupied by the jacket. Therefore, the first statement implies that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nOn the other hand, if the jacket is not hanging in the closet, then it must be draped over the chair, as there is no other possible location for it. Therefore, the second statement implies that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair, based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
