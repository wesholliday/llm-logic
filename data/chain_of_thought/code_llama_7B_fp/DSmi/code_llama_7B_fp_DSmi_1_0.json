Fido might not be in the garden.\n\nWe want to infer whether Fido is inside or not.\n\nTo do this, we can use the principle of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time.\n\nIf we assume that Fido is inside, then the first statement becomes \"Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden,\" which is a contradiction since we know that Fido might not be in the garden.\n\nOn the other hand, if we assume that Fido is not inside, then the second statement becomes \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" which is a contradiction since we know that Fido must be in the garden.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
