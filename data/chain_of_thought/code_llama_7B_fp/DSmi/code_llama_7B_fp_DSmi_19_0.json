The watch might not be on his wrist.\n\nTo infer the watch is charging on the dresser, we need to consider the first statement and the second statement together.\n\nIf the watch is charging on the dresser, then it must be on the dresser, which means it cannot be on his wrist. Therefore, the first statement implies that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nOn the other hand, if the watch is not on his wrist, then it cannot be charging on the dresser, as the watch must be on the wrist to be charging.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
