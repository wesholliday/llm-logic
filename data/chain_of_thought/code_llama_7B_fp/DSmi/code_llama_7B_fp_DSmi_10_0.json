The missing sock might not be under the bed.\n\nTo infer the missing sock is in the laundry basket, we need to consider the possibility that the missing sock is in the laundry basket, and also consider the possibility that the missing sock is under the bed.\n\nIf the missing sock is in the laundry basket, then it is either in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed. This is because the statement \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed\" is a logical contradiction, and therefore, it is not possible for the missing sock to be both in the laundry basket and under the bed at the same time.\n\nOn the other hand, if the missing sock is under the bed, then it is not in the laundry basket, and therefore, it is not possible for the missing sock to be in the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
