The statement is \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk.\" This means that if the pen is not in my bag, it must be on my desk.\n\nNow, we have another statement \"The pen might not be on my desk.\" This statement does not directly contradict the first statement, but it does provide some information. It suggests that the pen might not be on my desk, which means it could be in my bag.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the pen is in my bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
