This means that the cat is either in one of these two locations.\n\nThe second statement states that the cat might not be playing in the bedroom. This means that the cat is not in the bedroom, which means it must be in the couch.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
