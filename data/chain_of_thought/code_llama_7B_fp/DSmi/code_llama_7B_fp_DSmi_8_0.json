Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\n2. The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\n\nIf we assume that the remote control is not hiding under the couch, then it must be on the coffee table. This is because the first statement suggests that the remote control is either on the coffee table or hiding under the couch, and the second statement rules out the possibility that it is hiding under the couch. Therefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
