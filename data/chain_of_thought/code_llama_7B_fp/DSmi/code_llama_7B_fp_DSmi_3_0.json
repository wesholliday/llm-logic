The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" implies that the keys are either in the drawer or dangling in the cabinet, but it does not rule out the possibility that the keys are in neither the drawer nor the cabinet.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \"no\".",
