The watch isn't on his wrist.\n\nFrom these two pieces of information, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser. This is because if the watch were on his wrist, then the second statement would be false, since the watch is not on his wrist. Therefore, the watch must be charging on the dresser, which is consistent with the first statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
