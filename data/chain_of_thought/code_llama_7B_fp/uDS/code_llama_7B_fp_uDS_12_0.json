The jacket isn't hanging in the closet.\n\nWe can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair because the first statement implies that the jacket is either draped over the chair or hanging in the closet, and the second statement rules out the possibility that the jacket is hanging in the closet. Therefore, the jacket must be draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
