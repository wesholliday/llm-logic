We can infer that the cookies are in the jar because the first statement implies that the cookies are either in the jar or hidden in the pantry, and the second statement contradicts the first statement by saying that the cookies aren't hidden in the pantry. Therefore, if the first statement is true, then the cookies must be in the jar.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
