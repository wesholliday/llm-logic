The missing sock is not under the bed.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that the missing sock is in the laundry basket. This is because the first statement implies that the missing sock is in one of two possible locations, and the second statement rules out the possibility that the missing sock is under the bed. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
