The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet.\n\nWe can infer that the umbrella is in the car because the first statement implies that the umbrella is either in the car or in the closet, and the second statement rules out the possibility that the umbrella is in the closet. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
