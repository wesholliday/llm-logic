The toy isn't sitting on the shelf.\n\nWe can infer that the toy is in the toy box because the first statement implies that the toy is either in the toy box or sitting on the shelf, and the second statement rules out the possibility that the toy is sitting on the shelf. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
