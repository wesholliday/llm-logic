The shoes aren't lined up by the door.\n\nWe can infer that the shoes are in the closet because the second statement contradicts the first statement. If the shoes were lined up by the door, then the first statement would be false, since the shoes are not lined up by the door. Therefore, we can conclude that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
