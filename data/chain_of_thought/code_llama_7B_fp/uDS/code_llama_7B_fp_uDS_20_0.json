The sunglasses aren't perched on her head.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that the sunglasses are either in her bag or perched on her head.\n\nFrom the second statement, we can infer that the sunglasses are not perched on her head.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the sunglasses are perched on her head. If the sunglasses are perched on her head, then they are not in her bag, as the first statement states that the sunglasses are either in her bag or perched on her head. Therefore, if the sunglasses are perched on her head, then they must be in her bag, as the second statement states that the sunglasses are not perched on her head.\n\nSo, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag, as the first statement and the second statement both imply that the sunglasses are not perched on her head.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
