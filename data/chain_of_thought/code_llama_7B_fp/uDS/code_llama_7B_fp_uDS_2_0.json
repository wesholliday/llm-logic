The book isn't resting on the table.\n\nWe can infer that the book is on the shelf because the first statement implies that the book is either on the shelf or resting on the table, and the second statement rules out the possibility that the book is resting on the table. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
