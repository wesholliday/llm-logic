The pen isn't on my desk.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that the pen is either in my bag or on my desk.\n\nFrom the second statement, we can infer that the pen is not on my desk.\n\nNow, let's use logical reasoning to determine whether the pen is in my bag or not.\n\nIf the pen is in my bag, then it cannot be on my desk, as we have already established that the pen isn't on my desk. Therefore, if the pen is in my bag, then it must be in my bag and not on my desk.\n\nOn the other hand, if the pen is not in my bag, then it must be on my desk. However, we have already established that the pen isn't on my desk, so this option is not possible.\n\nTherefore, the only logical conclusion is that the pen is in my bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
