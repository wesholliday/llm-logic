'If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint' means that if the wug was flooped, then it would bim the zoint. 'The wug was flooped' means that the wug was indeed flooped.\n\nNow, we can use the premises to deduce the conclusion. If the wug was flooped, then it would bim the zoint. Since the wug was flooped, it must have bimmed the zoint. Therefore, we can infer that 'The wug bimmed the zoint'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
