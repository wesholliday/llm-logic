The wug was sproonged.\n\nTo infer \"It was garpled,\" we need to use the first premise to reason from the second premise. We can do this by using a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that involves three premises. The first premise is the major premise, and the second premise is the minor premise. The conclusion is the third premise.\n\nThe syllogism for this argument would be:\n\nMajor Premise: If the wug was sproonged, then it was garpled.\nMinor Premise: The wug was sproonged.\nConclusion: It was garpled.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes.",
