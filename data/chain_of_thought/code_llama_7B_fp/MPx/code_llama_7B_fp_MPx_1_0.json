The flugel was blimmed.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The flugel was zargled,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the meaning of the terms \"blimmed\" and \"zargled.\" These terms are not defined in the given premises, so we need to make an assumption about their meanings based on the context of the question.\n\nAssuming that \"blimmed\" means \"was blamed\" and \"zargled\" means \"was zapped,\" we can now apply the rules of logic to the given premises.\n\nUsing the first premise, we can infer that if the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled. This means that if the flugel was blamed, then it was zapped.\n\nUsing the second premise, we can infer that the flugel was blimmed. This means that the flugel was blamed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flugel was zargled, which means that the flugel was zapped.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
