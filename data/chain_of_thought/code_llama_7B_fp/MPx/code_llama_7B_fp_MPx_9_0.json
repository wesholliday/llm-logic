The twonk was plinked.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"It was varnished,\" we need to use the rules of inference. One of the rules of inference is Modus Ponens, which states that if a conditional statement is true and the condition is true, then the conclusion is also true.\n\nUsing Modus Ponens, we can infer the conclusion \"It was varnished\" from the premises. The conditional statement \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished\" is true, and the condition \"The twonk was plinked\" is also true. Therefore, the conclusion \"It was varnished\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
