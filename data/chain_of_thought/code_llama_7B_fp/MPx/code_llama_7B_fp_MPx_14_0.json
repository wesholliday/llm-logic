'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged' means that if the clug was fleeked, then it must have snuggled. 'The clug was fleeked' means that the clug was indeed fleeked.\n\nNow, we can use the premises to deduce the conclusion. If the clug was fleeked, then it must have snuggled. Therefore, we can infer that the clug snugged.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
