The dreb was vroombed.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The dreb was spended,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given information.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the meaning of the words \"vroombed\" and \"spended.\" \"Vroombed\" means to spend or expend, while \"spended\" means to have spent or expended.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given statements:\n\n1. If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spended.\n\nThis statement means that if the dreb was spent or expended, then it was also spent or expended.\n\n2. The dreb was vroombed.\n\nThis statement means that the dreb was spent or expended.\n\nNow, let's apply the first statement to the second statement:\n\nIf the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spended.\n\nThe dreb was vroombed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the dreb was spended.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
