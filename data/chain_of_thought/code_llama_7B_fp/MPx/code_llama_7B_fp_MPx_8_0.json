The sprocket was cranked.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The sprocket was daggled,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the relationship between the premises. The relationship is that the first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n\nSecond, we need to determine whether the second premise is sufficient to support the conclusion. In this case, the second premise is \"The sprocket was cranked,\" which is a fact.\n\nThird, we need to use the rules of inference to draw a conclusion. In this case, we can use the rule of modus ponens, which states that if a conditional statement is true, and the antecedent is true, then the conclusion is also true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that the sprocket was daggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
