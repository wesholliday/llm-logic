The truck might not have been blue.\n\nTo infer the car was not red, we need to consider the possibility that the truck might not have been blue. If the truck was not blue, then it is possible that the car was not red either. However, we cannot conclude that the car was not red based solely on the fact that the truck might not have been blue.\n\nAnswer: No.",
