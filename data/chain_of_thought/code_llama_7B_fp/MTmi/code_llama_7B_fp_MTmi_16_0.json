The pants might not have been denim.\n\nTo infer whether the shirt was not cotton, we need to consider the possible combinations of the given statements.\n\nIf the shirt was cotton and the pants were denim, then the statement \"The pants might not have been denim\" is false, as denim is a type of fabric that pants can be made of.\n\nOn the other hand, if the shirt was not cotton and the pants were denim, then the statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\" is false, as cotton and denim are two different types of fabric.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton if the pants were not denim.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
