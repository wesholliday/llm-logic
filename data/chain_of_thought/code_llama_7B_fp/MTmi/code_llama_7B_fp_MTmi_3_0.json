The book might not be a mystery novel.\n\nTo infer whether the book was written by James or not, we need to consider both statements and their logical relationships.\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\n2. The book might not be a mystery novel.\n\nIf the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel, as stated in the first statement.
