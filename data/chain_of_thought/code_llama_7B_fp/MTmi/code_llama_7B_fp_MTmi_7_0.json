Chris might not have finished the race.\n\nTo infer whether Alex did not finish the race, we need to consider both statements and their logical relationships.\n\n1. If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race. This means that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have also finished the race.\n2. Chris might not have finished the race. This means that Chris might not have finished the race, but it does not necessarily mean that he did not finish the race.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible combinations of these two statements:\n\n* If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\n* Chris might not have finished the race.\n\nIn this combination, we can infer that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race. However, if Chris might not have finished the race, then it is possible that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race if Chris might not have finished the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
