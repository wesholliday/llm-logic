Bob might not have chosen pasta.\n\nTo infer whether Sue did not choose pizza, we need to consider the possible combinations of the given statements.\n\nIf Sue chose pizza and Bob did not choose pasta, then we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nHowever, if Bob might not have chosen pasta, it is possible that Bob did choose pasta, and in that case, Sue's choice of pizza would not be relevant.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Sue did not choose pizza based solely on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No.",
