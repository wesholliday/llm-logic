Erin might not have taken a train.\n\nTo infer whether Sam did not take a plane, we need to consider the possible combinations of the given statements.\n\nIf Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. This means that if Sam took a plane, Erin did not take a train.\n\nErin might not have taken a train. This means that Erin did not necessarily take a train.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane if Erin did not take a train.
