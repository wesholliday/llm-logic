Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\n\nTo infer whether Lisa did not buy the red shirt, we need to consider the possibility that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, even if Lisa did buy the red shirt.\n\nIf Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then it is possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. However, if Mark did buy the blue shirt, then it is not possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No.",
