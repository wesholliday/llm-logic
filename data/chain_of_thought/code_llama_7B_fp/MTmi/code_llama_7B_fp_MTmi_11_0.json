The muffins might not have been blueberry.\n\nTo infer the cake was not chocolate, we need to consider the possibility that the muffins might not have been blueberry, even if the cake was chocolate.\n\nIf the muffins were blueberry, then the cake must have been chocolate, as stated in the first statement. However, if the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake could have been chocolate or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the cake was not chocolate based on the given statements alone. We need more information to make a conclusion about the cake's flavor.\n\nAnswer: No.",
