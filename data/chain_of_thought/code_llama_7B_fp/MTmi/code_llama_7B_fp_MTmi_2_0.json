The unicorn might not have been in the forest.\n\nTo infer the griffin was not in the forest, we need to consider the possibility that the unicorn might not have been in the forest. If the unicorn was not in the forest, then it is possible that the griffin was not in the forest either. However, we cannot be certain that the griffin was not in the forest without additional information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
