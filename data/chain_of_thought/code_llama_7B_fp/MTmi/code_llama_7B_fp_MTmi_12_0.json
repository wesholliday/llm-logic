Lucy might not have gone to the zoo.\n\nTo infer whether Joe did not go to the park, we need to consider the possibility that Lucy might not have gone to the zoo. If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then it is possible that Joe did not go to the park either. However, we cannot infer that Joe did not go to the park based solely on the fact that Lucy might not have gone to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: No.",
