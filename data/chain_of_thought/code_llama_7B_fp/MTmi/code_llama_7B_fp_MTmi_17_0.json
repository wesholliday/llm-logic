Kate might not have eaten salad.\n\nTo infer whether Ben did not eat pasta, we need to consider the possible combinations of the given premises.\n\nIf Ben did eat pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad, and Kate might not have eaten salad. This is a contradiction, as we cannot have both statements true. Therefore, Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nIf Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate might have eaten salad, and Kate might not have eaten salad. This is consistent with both statements being true or false. Therefore, Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
