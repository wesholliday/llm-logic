This means that if Jane studied, then she did not study for a sufficient amount of time to be considered \"studying long\".\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if Jane studied long, then she did not study. This is because if Jane studied for a long time, then she did not study for a sufficient amount of time to be considered \"studying long\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
