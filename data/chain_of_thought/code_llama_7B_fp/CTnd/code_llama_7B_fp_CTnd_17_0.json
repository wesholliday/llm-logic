This is because the word \"then\" in the statement implies a causal relationship between the two conditions.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted. This is because if the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted, which means that the customer was not greeted at all.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
