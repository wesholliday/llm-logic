This means that Ben studied, but did not put in the effort or time required to study diligently.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study.\" This statement is the opposite of the first statement, and it implies that Ben did not study diligently, but did study.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer the second statement from the first statement, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements. If the first statement is true, then the second statement must also be true, because the first statement implies that Ben studied, but did not study diligently. However, if the second statement is true, then it implies that Ben did not study, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first statement. The two statements are contradictory, and we cannot logically deduce one from the other.\n\nAnswer: No.",
