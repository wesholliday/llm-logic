This means that the clothes were washed, but they were not washed properly.\n\nOn the other hand, if the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed. This means that the clothes were not washed, but they were washed properly.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed. This is because the statement is logically contradictory, and we cannot have a statement that is both true and false at the same time.\n\nAnswer: No.",
