This means that if the room was cleaned, it was not cleaned to the highest standard.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned\". This statement is the opposite of the first statement, and it implies that if the room was cleaned thoroughly, it was not cleaned at all.\n\nIt is important to note that these two statements are logically contradictory. If the room was cleaned thoroughly, it means that it was cleaned to the highest standard, which means that it was not cleaned at all. This is a logical contradiction, and it implies that the statements are not equivalent.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned\" from \"If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly\".",
