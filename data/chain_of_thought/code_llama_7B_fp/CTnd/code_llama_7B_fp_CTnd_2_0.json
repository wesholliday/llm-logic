The statement implies that if Ann exercised, then she did not exercise strenuously, but it does not necessarily mean that if Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise.\n\nFor example, Ann may have exercised strenuously but still not have exercised. In this case, the first statement would be true, but the second statement would not be true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise.",
