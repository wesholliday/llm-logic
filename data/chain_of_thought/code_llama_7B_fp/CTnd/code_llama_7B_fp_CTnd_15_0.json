This means that if the room was tidied, it was not tidied to the fullest extent.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied\". This statement is the opposite of the first statement, and it implies that if the room was tidied thoroughly, it was not tidied at all.\n\nIt is important to note that these two statements are logically contradictory. If the room was tidied, it was not tidied thoroughly, and if the room was tidied thoroughly, it was not tidied at all. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied\" from \"If the room was tidied, then it was not tidied thoroughly\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
