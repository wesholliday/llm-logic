This means that if Alex did exercise, then he did not exercise much.\n\nHowever, it does not necessarily follow that if Alex did not exercise much, then he did not exercise at all. It is possible that Alex did not exercise much because he was too tired or because he did not have the time, but he still exercised.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If Alex did not exercise much, then he did not exercise\" from the statement \"If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much.\"",
