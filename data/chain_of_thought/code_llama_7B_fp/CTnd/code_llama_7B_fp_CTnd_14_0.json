The statement \"If the meal was prepared, then it was not prepared carefully\" is an example of this fallacy. It is not possible to infer that \"If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared\" because the first statement is already false.\n\nIf the meal was prepared, then it was not prepared carefully. This means that the meal was prepared, but it was not prepared carefully. It does not necessarily follow that if the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared.\n\nAnswer: No.",
