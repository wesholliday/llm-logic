This means that the customer was served, but not served in a timely manner.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served\". This statement is the opposite of the first statement, and it implies that the customer was served promptly, but not served.\n\nTo determine whether the second statement is logically equivalent to the first statement, we need to analyze the meaning of each statement.\n\nThe first statement implies that the customer was served, but not served promptly. This means that the customer was served, but not served in a timely manner.\n\nThe second statement implies that the customer was served promptly, but not served. This means that the customer was served in a timely manner, but not served.\n\nBoth statements imply that the customer was not served in a timely manner. However, the first statement implies that the customer was served, but not served promptly, while the second statement implies that the customer was served promptly, but not served.\n\nTherefore, the second statement is not logically equivalent to the first statement. The first statement implies that the customer was served, but not served promptly, while the second statement implies that the customer was served promptly, but not served.\n\nAnswer: No.",
