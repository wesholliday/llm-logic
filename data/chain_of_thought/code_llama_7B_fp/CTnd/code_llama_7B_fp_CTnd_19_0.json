Similarly, if a person is given instructions, but the instructions are not clear, it is still possible for the person to follow the instructions and find their way.\n\nTherefore, it is not accurate to say that \"If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided\" because it is possible for directions to be provided and still not be explained clearly.\n\nAnswer: No.",
