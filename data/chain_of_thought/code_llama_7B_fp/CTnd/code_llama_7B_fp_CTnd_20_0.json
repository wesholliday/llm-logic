This means that the recommendation was not very convincing or persuasive.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made\". This statement is the opposite of the first one, and it implies that a strong recommendation was not made, which means that no recommendation was made at all.\n\nSo, we can infer that if a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made. This means that if a recommendation was made, then it was not a strong recommendation.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
