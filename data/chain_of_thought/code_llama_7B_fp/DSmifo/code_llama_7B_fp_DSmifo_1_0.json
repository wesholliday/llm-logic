Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside.\n\nWe want to infer whether Fido is inside or not.\n\nTo do this, we can use a process of elimination. We know that Fido is not in the garden, so we can eliminate the possibility that Fido is in the garden. This leaves us with the possibility that Fido is inside.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
