Either the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The toy is in the toy box,\" we need to consider the possible combinations of the given premises.\n\nIf the toy is not sitting on the bookshelf, then it must be in the toy box. This is because the second premise states that either the toy is sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box. If the toy is not sitting on the bookshelf, then it must be in the toy box, according to the second premise.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The toy is in the toy box\" based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
