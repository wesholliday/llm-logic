This is because the second statement states that either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter. If the milk is not chilling in the fridge, it cannot be chilling in the fridge, so it must be on the counter.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The milk is on the counter\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
