We need to use the premises to infer a conclusion. The conclusion we want to infer is \"The smip was not shripped\".\n\nTo infer this conclusion, we need to use the premises to show that it is not possible for the smip to have been shripped. If the smip was shripped, then it must have lumped the zoint, which contradicts the fact that it is not the case that the smip must have lumped the zoint. Therefore, we can infer that the smip was not shripped.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
