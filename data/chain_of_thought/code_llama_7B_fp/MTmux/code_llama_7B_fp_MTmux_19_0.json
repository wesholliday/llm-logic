We need to use the first premise to infer the second premise, and then use the second premise to infer the conclusion.\n\nUsing the first premise, we can infer that if the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged. This means that if the smonk was vreebled, then it is necessary that the smonk must have plagged.\n\nUsing the second premise, we can infer that it is not the case that the smonk must have plagged. This means that it is not necessary that the smonk must have plagged.\n\nNow, let's use the second premise to infer the conclusion. If it is not necessary that the smonk must have plagged, then it is possible that the smonk was not vreebled. Therefore, we can infer that \"The smonk was not vreebled\" from \"It's not the case that the smonk must have plagged.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
