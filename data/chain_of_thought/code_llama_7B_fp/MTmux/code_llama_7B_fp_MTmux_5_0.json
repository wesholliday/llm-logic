If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger must have been smoogled.\n2. It's not the case that the zinger must have been smoogled.\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer that the zinger was not fraggled. This is because if the zinger was fraggled, then it would have been smoogled, but since it's not the case that the zinger must have been smoogled, we can conclude that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
