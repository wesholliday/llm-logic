This means that if the clug was fleeked, it must have been the case that the clug was also snugged.\n\nOn the other hand, 'It's not the case that the clug must have been snugged' means that it is not necessarily the case that the clug must have been snugged. This does not necessarily imply that the clug was not fleeked, as it could have been fleeked but not snugged.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The clug was not fleeked' from 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged' together with 'It's not the case that the clug must have been snugged'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
