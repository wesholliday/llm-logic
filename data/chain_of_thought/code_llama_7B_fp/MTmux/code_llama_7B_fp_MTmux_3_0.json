It's not the case that the splat must have quanked.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The splat was not morphed,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\n1. Premise 1: If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked.\n2. Premise 2: It's not the case that the splat must have quanked.\n\nWe can use the following rules of inference to infer the conclusion:\n\n1. Modus ponens: If the premise is true, then the conclusion follows.\n2. Modus tollens: If the conclusion is false, then the premise is false.\n\nUsing these rules, we can deduce the following:\n\n1. If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked.\n2. The splat was not morphed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
