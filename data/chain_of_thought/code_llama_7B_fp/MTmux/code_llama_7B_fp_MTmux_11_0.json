It's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The flug was not blummed,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the conclusion that we want to draw from the given premises. The conclusion is \"The flug was not blummed.\"\n\nNext, we need to determine whether the given premises entail the conclusion. To do this, we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nUsing the first premise, we can infer that if the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed. This means that if the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed.\n\nUsing the second premise, we can infer that it's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed. This means that it's not the case that the flug was zimmed.\n\nNow, we need to use the rules of inference to draw a conclusion from the given premises. One possible conclusion is that the flug was not blummed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flug was not blummed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
