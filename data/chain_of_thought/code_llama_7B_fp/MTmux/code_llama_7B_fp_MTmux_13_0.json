It's not the case that the glip must have tragged.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The glip was not slogged,\" we need to use logical reasoning.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the meaning of the given premises. The first premise states that if the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged. This means that if the glip was slogged, then it must have been tragged.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the glip must have tragged. This means that it's possible that the glip was not tragged, even if it was slogged.\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of inference to the given premises. We need to use the rule of non-contradiction to infer the conclusion.\n\nThe rule of non-contradiction states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time. In this case, we have two statements:\n\n1. The glip was slogged.\n2. The glip was not tragged.\n\nIf we assume that both statements are true, then we have a contradiction. This means that we cannot assume that both statements are true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the glip was not slogged.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
