It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The grommet was not sploffed,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the conclusion that we want to draw. In this case, the conclusion is \"The grommet was not sploffed.\"\n\nNext, we need to examine the premises and determine whether they are logically consistent with the conclusion. In this case, the premises are not logically consistent with the conclusion.\n\nThe first premise states that if the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink. This means that if the grommet was sploffed, then it must have plopped the frink.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink. This means that it's not necessarily true that the grommet must have plopped the frink.\n\nSince the premises are not logically consistent with the conclusion, we cannot infer the conclusion \"The grommet was not sploffed.\" Therefore, the answer is \"no.\"",
