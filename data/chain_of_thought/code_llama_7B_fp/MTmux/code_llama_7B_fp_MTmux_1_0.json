It's not the case that the flugel must have been zargled.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The flugel was not blimmed,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the conclusion that we want to draw. In this case, the conclusion is \"The flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\nNext, we need to examine the premises and determine whether they are logically consistent with the conclusion. In this case, the premises are not logically consistent with the conclusion.\n\nThe first premise states that if the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled. This means that if the flugel was blimmed, then it must have been the case that the flugel was zargled. However, the second premise states that it is not the case that the flugel must have been zargled. This means that it is possible that the flugel was blimmed but not zargled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the conclusion \"The flugel was not blimmed\" from the given premises.",
