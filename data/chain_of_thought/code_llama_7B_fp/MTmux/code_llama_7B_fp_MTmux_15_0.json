            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given premises are:\n\n1. If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spended.\n2. It's not the case that the dreb must have been spended.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The dreb was not vroombed,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the conclusion that we want to draw. In this case, the conclusion is \"The dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\nNext, we need to examine the premises and determine whether they are logically consistent with the conclusion.\n\nThe first premise states that if the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spended. This premise is a conditional statement, and it implies that if the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spended.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the dreb must have been spended. This premise is a negative statement, and it implies that the dreb must not have been spended.\n\nNow, we need to use the rules of inference to draw the conclusion.\n\nOne rule of inference is called the \"modus ponens\" rule, which states that if a conditional statement is true, and the antecedent of the conditional statement is true, then the consequent of the conditional statement must also be true.\n\nUsing the modus ponens rule, we can infer that if the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spended. However, we also know that the dreb must not have been spended, which contradicts the first premise. Therefore, we can conclude that the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
