It's not the case that the flob must have movated.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The flob was not skizzled,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the conclusion that we want to draw. In this case, the conclusion is \"The flob was not skizzled.\"\n\nNext, we need to examine the premises and determine whether they are logically consistent with the conclusion.\n\nThe first premise states that if the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated. This premise is a conditional statement, and it implies that if the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the flob must have movated. This premise is a negative statement, and it implies that the flob must not have movated.\n\nNow, we need to use the rules of inference to draw the conclusion.\n\nOne possible rule of inference that we can use is the modus tollens rule, which states that if a conditional statement is false, then the consequent must be true.\n\nUsing this rule, we can infer that if the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated. However, since the second premise states that it's not the case that the flob must have movated, we can conclude that the flob was not skizzled.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The flob was not skizzled\" is logically inferred from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
