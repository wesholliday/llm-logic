If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The smonk was not plagged,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to determine whether the premises are true or false. If they are false, then the conclusion will also be false, regardless of the truth value of the conclusion.\n\nNext, we need to determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. If the conclusion logically follows from the premises, then we can infer it.\n\nBased on the given premises, we can infer that the smonk was not vreebled. If the smonk was not vreebled, then it is not possible for it to have plagged. Therefore, we can infer that the smonk was not plagged.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
