If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The shank was not nugged,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we need to consider the first premise: \"The shank was not plooked.\" This means that the shank was not looked at or examined.\n\nSecond, we need to consider the second premise: \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\" This means that if the shank was looked at or examined, then it was also nugged.\n\nNow, let's apply the second premise to the first premise. If the shank was not plooked, then it was not looked at or examined. Therefore, it cannot have been nugged, as the second premise states.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The shank was not nugged\" based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
