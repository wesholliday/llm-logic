If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The sprocket was not daggled,\" we need to use logical reasoning.\n\nFirst, we need to determine whether the premise \"The sprocket was not cranked\" is true or false. If it is true, then we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked, and therefore, it was not daggled.\n\nSecond, we need to determine whether the premise \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" is true or false. If it is true, then we can infer that if the sprocket was cranked, then it was daggled.\n\nIf both premises are true, then we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked, and therefore, it was not daggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
