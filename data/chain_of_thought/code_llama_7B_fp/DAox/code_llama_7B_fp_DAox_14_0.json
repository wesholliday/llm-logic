The clug was not fleeked.\n2. If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the clug was not fleeked, then it is possible that the clug was not snugged. However, if the clug was fleeked, then it is also possible that the clug was snugged.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The clug was not snugged' from the given information alone. We need more information or evidence to make a conclusion about the clug's snuggling status.\n\nAnswer: No.",
