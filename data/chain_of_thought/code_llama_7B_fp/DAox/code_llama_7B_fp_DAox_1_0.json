If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The flugel was not zargled,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nStep 1: We need to determine whether the premise \"The flugel was not blimmed\" is true or false.\n\nIf the premise is true, then we can infer that the flugel was not blimmed, and therefore, it was not zargled.\n\nIf the premise is false, then we cannot infer anything about the flugel's zargled status.\n\nStep 2: We need to determine whether the premise \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled\" is true or false.\n\nIf the premise is true, then we can infer that if the flugel was blimmed, then it was zargled.\n\nIf the premise is false, then we cannot infer anything about the flugel's zargled status.\n\nStep 3: We need to determine whether the conclusion \"The flugel was not zargled\" is true or false.\n\nIf the conclusion is true, then we can infer that the flugel was not blimmed, and therefore, it was not zargled.\n\nIf the conclusion is false, then we cannot infer anything about the flugel's blimmed status.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
