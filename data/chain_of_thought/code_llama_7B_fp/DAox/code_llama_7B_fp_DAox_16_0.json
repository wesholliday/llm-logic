If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The sneg did not sprot the frink,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to determine whether the premises are consistent with each other. If the premises are consistent, we can use the rules of inference to draw a conclusion.\n\nConsidering the first premise, \"The sneg was not crampled,\" we can infer that the sneg is not cramped.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise, \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\" This premise states that if the sneg is cramped, then the sneg will sprout the frink.\n\nSince the sneg is not cramped, we can infer that it did not sprout the frink. Therefore, the conclusion \"The sneg did not sprot the frink\" is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
