If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The fleeg did not surn,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to determine whether the premises are consistent with each other. We can do this by checking the validity of the argument.\n\nThe argument is valid because the premises are both true, and the conclusion logically follows from them. Therefore, we can infer the conclusion \"The fleeg did not surn\" from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
