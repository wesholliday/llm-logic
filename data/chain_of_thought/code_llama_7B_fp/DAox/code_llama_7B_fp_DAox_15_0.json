If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spended.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The dreb was not spended,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the meaning of the words \"vroombed\" and \"spended.\"\n\n\"Vroombed\" means to have been vroomed, which means to have been given a vroom.\n\n\"Spended\" means to have been spent, which means to have been used up or consumed.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given premises:\n\n1. The dreb was not vroombed.\n\nThis means that the dreb was not given a vroom.\n\n2. If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spended.\n\nThis means that if the dreb was given a vroom, then the dreb was used up or consumed.\n\nNow, let's use the given premises to infer the conclusion:\n\nIf the dreb was not vroombed, then it was not given a vroom, and therefore it was not used up or consumed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the dreb was not spended.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
