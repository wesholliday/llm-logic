If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The twonk was not varnished,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we need to consider the first premise: \"The twonk was not plinked.\" This means that the twonk was not subjected to the action of plinking.\n\nSecond, we need to consider the second premise: \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\" This means that if the twonk was subjected to the action of plinking, then it would have been varnished.\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of inference to the given premises. We can use the following rule of inference:\n\nIf A is true and B is true, then if A implies B, then it is possible that not-B is true.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nA: The twonk was not plinked.\nB: The twonk was varnished.\n\nWe can infer that if the twonk was plinked, then it would have been varnished. Therefore, it is possible that the twonk was not plinked, but it was still not varnished.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The twonk was not varnished\" can be inferred from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
