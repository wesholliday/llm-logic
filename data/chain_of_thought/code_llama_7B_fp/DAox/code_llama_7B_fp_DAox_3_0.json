            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statements are:\n\n1. \"The splat was not morphed.\"\n2. \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\"\n\nTo infer whether the splat did not quank, we need to analyze the given statements and their logical relationships.\n\nFirstly, the first statement \"The splat was not morphed\" implies that the splat was not transformed or changed in any way.\n\nSecondly, the second statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" implies that if the splat was transformed, it would have quanked.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the splat was morphed. If the splat was morphed, then it would have quanked, according to the second statement. Therefore, if the splat was morphed, it would have quanked.\n\nHowever, the first statement \"The splat was not morphed\" contradicts this possibility. If the splat was morphed, then it would have quanked, but the first statement states that the splat was not morphed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the splat did not quank.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
