If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The grommet did not plop the frink,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we need to consider the possibility that the grommet did sploff. If the grommet did sploff, then it is possible that it plopped the frink. However, this is not the case, as the premise \"The grommet did not sploff\" states that the grommet did not sploff.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the grommet did not plop the frink.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
