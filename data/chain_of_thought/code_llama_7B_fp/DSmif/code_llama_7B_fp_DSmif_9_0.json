The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor.\n\nTo infer the missing puzzle piece is in the box, we need to consider the possibility that the missing puzzle piece is in the box, and then evaluate the given statements to determine whether this possibility is supported.\n\n1. The missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\n\nThis statement is a contradiction, as the missing puzzle piece cannot be both blending in on the floor and in the box. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n2. The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor.\n\nThis statement is true, as the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
