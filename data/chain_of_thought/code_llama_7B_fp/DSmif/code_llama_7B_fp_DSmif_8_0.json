The first statement, \"Either the remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table,\" implies that the remote control is either hidden under the couch or it is on the coffee table. The second statement, \"The remote control isn't hiding under the couch,\" rules out the possibility that the remote control is hidden under the couch. Therefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
