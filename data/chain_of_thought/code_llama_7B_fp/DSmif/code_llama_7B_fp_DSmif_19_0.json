The statement \"Either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser\" implies that the watch is not on his wrist, which means it must be charging on the dresser. The statement \"The watch might not be on his wrist\" does not contradict this inference, as it simply states that the watch might not be on his wrist, which is already established. Therefore, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
