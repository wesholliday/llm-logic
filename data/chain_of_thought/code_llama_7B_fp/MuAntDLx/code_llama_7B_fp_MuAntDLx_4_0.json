The sentence structure suggests that the missing word is a verb, as it is in the form of a subject-verb-object sentence. The word \"must\" is a modal verb indicating necessity, and \"be\" is a verb that fits grammatically in this context. Therefore, we can infer that the missing word is indeed \"be\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
