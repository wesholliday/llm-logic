Either the glip is slogged or it must be tragged.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The glip is slogged,\" we need to use logical reasoning to connect the given premises.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the glip must be tragged by using the first premise. If the glip must be tragged, then the first premise would be false, which means that the glip must not be tragged.\n\nSecond, we can use the second premise to infer that either the glip is slogged or it must be tragged. If the glip is slogged, then the second premise would be true, which means that the glip is slogged.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
