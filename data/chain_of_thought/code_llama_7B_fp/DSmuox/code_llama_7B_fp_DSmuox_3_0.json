Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The splat is morphed,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the splat must be quanked by using the first premise. If the splat must be quanked, then the first premise would be false. Therefore, we can conclude that the splat is not necessarily quanked.\n\nNext, we can use the second premise to infer that either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked. If the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed. Therefore, we can conclude that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
