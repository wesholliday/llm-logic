This is because the negation of 'The fleeg must be surned' is 'The fleeg must not be surned', and if 'It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned' is true, then 'The fleeg must not be surned' must be false.\n\nSecond, we can deduce that 'The fleeg is bluttered' from 'Either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned'. This is because the premise 'Either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned' is logically equivalent to 'The fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned', and if 'The fleeg is bluttered' is true, then 'it must be surned' must be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The fleeg is bluttered' from 'It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned' together with 'Either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
