Either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The wug is sproinged,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the wug must be garpled, as stated in the first premise. This means that the wug is not necessarily garpled, and we can assume that it is not.\n\nSecond, we can use the second premise to infer that either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled. This means that if the wug is not garpled, it must be sproinged.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the wug is sproinged, based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
