Therefore, we can infer that the premise \"the smonk must be plagged\" is true, since its negation is false.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"The smonk is vreebled.\" This statement asserts that the premise \"the smonk is vreebled\" is true.\n\nBased on the previous analysis, we can infer that the premise \"the smonk must be plagged\" is true, since its negation is false. Therefore, we can infer that the statement \"The smonk is vreebled\" is true, since it asserts that the premise \"the smonk is vreebled\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
