Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The fribble is snurgled,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to negate the first premise to get the contrapositive:\n\n1'. The fribble must be crinked.\n\nNext, we need to use the second premise to eliminate the possibility that the fribble is not snurgled:\n\n2'. The fribble is snurgled.\n\nNow, we can infer the conclusion \"The fribble is snurgled\" by combining the two premises:\n\n1'. The fribble must be crinked.\n2'. The fribble is snurgled.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The fribble is snurgled\" can be inferred from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
