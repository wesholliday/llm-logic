If the flug must be zimmed, then the first premise would be false, which means that the flug must not be zimmed.\n\nNext, we can use the second premise to infer that either the flug is blummed or it must be zimmed. If the flug is blummed, then the second premise would be true, which means that the flug is blummed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flug is blummed based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
