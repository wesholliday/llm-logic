Either the smip is shripped or it must be lupped.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The smip is shripped,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the smip must be lupped by using the first premise. If the smip must be lupped, then the first premise would be false, which means that the smip cannot be lupped.\n\nNext, we can use the second premise to infer that either the smip is shripped or it must be lupped. If the smip is shripped, then the second premise would be true, which means that the conclusion \"The smip is shripped\" would be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
