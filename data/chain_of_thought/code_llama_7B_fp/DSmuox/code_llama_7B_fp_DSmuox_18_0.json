Either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The shank is plooked,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the shank must be nugged, as stated in the first premise. This means that the shank is not required to be nugged.\n\nSecond, we can infer that the shank is either plooked or it must be nugged, as stated in the second premise. This means that the shank is either plooked or it must be nugged, but we have already eliminated the possibility that it must be nugged.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shank is plooked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
