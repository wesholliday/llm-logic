Either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The flugel is blimmed,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the flugel must be zargled, as stated in the first premise. This means that the flugel is not required to be zargled.\n\nSecond, we can infer that the flugel is either blimmed or it must be zargled, as stated in the second premise. This means that the flugel is either blimmed or it must be zargled, but we have already eliminated the possibility that it must be zargled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
