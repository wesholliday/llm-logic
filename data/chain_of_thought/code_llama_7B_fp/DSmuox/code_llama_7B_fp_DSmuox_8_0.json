Either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The sprocket is cranked,\" we need to use logical reasoning to connect the given premises.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the sprocket must be daggled, since the first premise states that it is not the case that the sprocket must be daggled. This means that the sprocket is not necessarily daggled, and we can assume that it is not.\n\nNext, we can consider the second premise, which states that either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled. Since we have already eliminated the possibility that the sprocket must be daggled, we can infer that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the conclusion \"The sprocket is cranked\" based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
