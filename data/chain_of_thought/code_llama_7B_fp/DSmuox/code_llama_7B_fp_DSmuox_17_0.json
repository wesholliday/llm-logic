It does not necessarily mean that the flob is skizzled.\n\n2. \"Either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated\"\n\nThis statement means that either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated. It does not necessarily mean that the flob is skizzled.\n\nBased on these two statements, we cannot infer the statement \"The flob is skizzled\" because the first statement does not necessarily imply that the flob is skizzled, and the second statement does not necessarily imply that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: No.",
