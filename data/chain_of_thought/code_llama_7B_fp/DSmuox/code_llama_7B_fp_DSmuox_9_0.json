Either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The twonk is varnished,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to negate the first premise to get the contrapositive: \"The twonk must be plinked.\"\n\nSecond, we need to use the second premise to eliminate the possibility that the twonk is not varnished. We can do this by using the law of excluded middle, which states that every statement is either true or false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
