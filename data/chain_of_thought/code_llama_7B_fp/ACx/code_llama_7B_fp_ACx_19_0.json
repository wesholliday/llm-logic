The smonk plagged.\n\nTo infer the first sentence from the second, we need to use the principle of sufficient reason. The principle of sufficient reason states that if A implies B, and B is true, then A must be true.\n\nIn this case, we have two sentences:\n\n1. If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\n2. The smonk plagged.\n\nWe can infer the first sentence from the second by using the principle of sufficient reason. The second sentence implies that the smonk plagged, which means that the smonk was plagged. Since the first sentence implies that if the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged, we can infer that the smonk was vreebled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
