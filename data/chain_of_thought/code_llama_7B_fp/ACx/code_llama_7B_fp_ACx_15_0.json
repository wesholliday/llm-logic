The dreb was spended.\n\nTo infer the first statement from the given statements, we need to use logical reasoning. We can do this by following these steps:\n\n1. Start with the given statement \"The dreb was spended.\"\n2. Infer the negation of the second statement, which is \"The dreb was not spended.\"\n3. Use the first statement to infer the negation of the second statement, which is \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was not spended.\"\n4. Infer the negation of the third statement, which is \"The dreb was vroombed.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The dreb was vroombed\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
