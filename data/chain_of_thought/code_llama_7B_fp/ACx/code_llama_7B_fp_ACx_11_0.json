The flug was zimmed.\n\nTo infer the first statement from the given statements, we need to use logical reasoning. We can do this by following these steps:\n\n1. Start with the given statement \"The flug was zimmed.\"\n2. Apply the conditional statement \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\"\n3. If the premise (the first part of the conditional statement) is true, then the conclusion (the second part of the conditional statement) must also be true.\n4. Since the premise is true (the flug was zimmed), we can infer that the conclusion must also be true.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that \"The flug was blummed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
