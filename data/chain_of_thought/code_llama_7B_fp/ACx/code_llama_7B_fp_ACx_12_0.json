The smip lupped the zoint.\n\nTo infer the third statement, we need to use the rules of logic and the given statements.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the premises and the conclusion. The premises are the two given statements, and the conclusion is the third statement we want to infer.\n\nNext, we need to analyze the structure of the statements. The first statement is a conditional statement, and the second statement is a simple statement.\n\nNow, we need to apply the rules of logic to infer the conclusion. The rule of inference we need to use is Modus Ponens, which states that if a conditional statement is true and the antecedent is true, then the conclusion is also true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the third statement as follows:\n\n1. If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint. (Premise 1)\n2. The smip lupped the zoint. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the smip was shripped. (Conclusion)\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
