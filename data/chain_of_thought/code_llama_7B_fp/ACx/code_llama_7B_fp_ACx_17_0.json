The flob movated.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The flob was skizzled,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the relationship between the premises. The relationship is that the first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the flob was skizzled) is true, then the consequent (the flob movated) must also be true.\n\nSecond, we need to determine whether the consequent (the flob movated) is true based on the second premise. Since the second premise states that the flob movated, we can infer that the consequent is true.\n\nThird, we need to determine whether the antecedent (the flob was skizzled) is true based on the first premise. Since the first premise states that if the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated, we can infer that the antecedent is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the conclusion \"The flob was skizzled\" based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
