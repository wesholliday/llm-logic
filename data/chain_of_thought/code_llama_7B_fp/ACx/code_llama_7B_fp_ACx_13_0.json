The glip was tragged.\n\nTo infer the first statement from the given statements, we need to use logical reasoning. We can do this by following these steps:\n\n1. Start with the second statement, \"The glip was tragged.\"\n2. Apply the conditional statement \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\"\n3. If the first statement is true, then the second statement must also be true.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that \"The glip was slogged.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
