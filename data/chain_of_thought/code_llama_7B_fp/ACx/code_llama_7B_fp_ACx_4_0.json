The first statement is \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\" The second statement is \"The fribble crinked.\" The third statement is \"The fribble was snurgled.\"\n\nTo infer the first statement from the second and third statements, we need to use the following logical steps:\n\n1. Start with the second statement, \"The fribble crinked.\"\n2. Use the first statement, \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked,\" to infer that the fribble was snurgled.\n3. Use the third statement, \"The fribble was snurgled,\" to confirm that the fribble was snurgled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the first statement from the second and third statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
