The splat quanked.\n\nTo infer the third statement, \"The splat was morphed,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given statements.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the meaning of the words \"morphed\" and \"quanked.\" \"Morphed\" means to change the shape or form of something, and \"quanked\" means to make a loud, high-pitched sound.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given statements:\n\n1. If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\n\nThis statement means that if the splat was changed into a different shape or form, then it would make a loud sound.\n\n2. The splat quanked.\n\nThis statement means that the splat made a loud sound.\n\nNow, let's use the given statements to infer the third statement: \"The splat was morphed.\"\n\nWe know that the splat made a loud sound (statement 2). If the splat was morphed, then it would have made a loud sound (statement 1). Therefore, we can infer that the splat was morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
