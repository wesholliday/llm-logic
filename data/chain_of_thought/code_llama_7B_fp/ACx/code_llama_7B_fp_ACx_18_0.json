            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statements are:\n\n1. If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\n2. The shank was nugged.\n\nTo infer the first statement from the given statements, we need to use logical reasoning. We can do this by following the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the premises and the conclusion. The premises are \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\" and \"The shank was nugged.\" The conclusion is \"The shank was plooked.\"\n\nNext, we need to determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises. To do this, we need to use the rules of inference.\n\nOne rule of inference is the modus ponens rule, which states that if a statement of the form \"If A, then B\" is true and \"A\" is true, then \"B\" must be true. In this case, the premises are \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\" and \"The shank was nugged.\" The conclusion is \"The shank was plooked.\"\n\nUsing the modus ponens rule, we can infer that \"The shank was plooked\" from the given premises. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
