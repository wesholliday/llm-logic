The sprocket was daggled.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The sprocket was cranked,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the meaning of the words \"cranked\" and \"daggled.\"\n\n\"Cranked\" means to turn or rotate something, usually a handle or a wheel.\n\n\"Daggled\" means to make a sharp or pointed sound, often with a metallic or rusty object.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given premises:\n\n1. If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n\nThis premise means that if the sprocket was turned or rotated, then it would make a sharp or pointed sound.\n\n2. The sprocket was daggled.\n\nThis premise means that the sprocket did make a sharp or pointed sound.\n\nNow, let's use the premises to infer the conclusion:\n\nIf the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n\nThe sprocket was daggled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sprocket was cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
