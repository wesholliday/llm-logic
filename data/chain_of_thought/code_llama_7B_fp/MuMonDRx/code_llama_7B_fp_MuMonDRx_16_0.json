To determine if we can infer the conclusion, let's break down the given statement and the proposed conclusion.\n\nThe given statement is: \"The plonk must be flimble zibber.\"\n\nThe proposed conclusion is: \"The plonk must be quimble flonk or flimble zibber.\"\n\nTo determine if we can infer the conclusion, we need to see if the given statement logically implies the conclusion. In other words, do we have enough information to conclude that the plonk must be either quimble flonk or flimble zibber?\n\nThe problem is that the given statement only mentions \"flimble zibber,\" but does not provide any information about \"quimble flonk.\" Therefore, we cannot logically infer that the plonk must be quimble flonk or flimble zibber, because we have no information about quimble flonk.\n\nAnswer: no"
