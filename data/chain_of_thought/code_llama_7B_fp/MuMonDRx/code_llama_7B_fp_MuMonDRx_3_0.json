This statement implies a relationship between the floob and the froodle, specifically that the floob is contained within the froodle. However, it does not provide any information about the relationship between the floob and the zibble. The zibble is not mentioned in the original statement, so we cannot infer any information about it. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the floob must be on the zibble.\n\nAnswer: no"
