However, the addition of \"or froodle\" introduces a new element that is not present in the original statement. The original statement does not provide any information about \"froodle\", and therefore, we cannot infer that \"fizzle\" must be related to \"froodle\" in the same way it is related to \"zizz\" through \"zooble\".\n\nAnswer: no"
