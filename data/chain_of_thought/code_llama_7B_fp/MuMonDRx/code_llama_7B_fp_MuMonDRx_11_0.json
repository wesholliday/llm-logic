However, the conclusion \"The frozz must be flibbit or quazzle\" introduces an additional option, flibbit, which is not present in the original statement. This conclusion is an expansion of the original statement, but it is not a direct inference from it. The original statement does not provide any information about the possibility of the frozz being flibbit.\n\nAnswer: no"
