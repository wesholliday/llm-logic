We are also given that Bob chose pasta.\n\nTo infer that Bob chose pasta, we need to show that the premises are sufficient to justify the conclusion. In this case, the premises are:\n\n1. Sue chose pizza.\n2. Sue chose pizza.\n3. Bob chose pasta.\n\nThe conclusion is that Bob chose pasta.\n\nTo show that the premises are sufficient to justify the conclusion, we need to consider the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. In this case, the premises are all about Sue and Bob's choices, and the conclusion is about Bob's choice.\n\nSince Sue chose pizza twice, we can infer that she likes pizza. Since Bob chose pasta, we can infer that he likes pasta. Since Sue chose pizza twice, we can also infer that Bob chose pasta because he likes the same thing that Sue likes.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Bob chose pasta based on the premises that Sue chose pizza twice and that Bob chose pasta.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
