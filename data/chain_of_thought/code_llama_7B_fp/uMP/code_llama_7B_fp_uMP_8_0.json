Also, the vampire was awake.\"\n\nFrom this statement, we can infer that the mummy was awake. This is because the first clause \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" implies that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake. Since the vampire is awake, and the first clause is true, then the second clause must also be true, which means the mummy is awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
