This means that if the bear was in the cave, then it is likely that the wolf was also in the den. However, it does not necessarily mean that the wolf was in the den.\n\nThere could be other factors that led to the bear being in the cave, such as the bear being attracted to the cave for some other reason, or the bear being in the cave for a different reason altogether. Therefore, it is not necessarily true that the wolf was in the den.\n\nAnswer: No.",
