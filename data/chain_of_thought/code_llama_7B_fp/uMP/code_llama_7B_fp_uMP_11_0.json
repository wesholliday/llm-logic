This is because the statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that is true only if a certain condition is met. In this case, the condition is that the cake is chocolate.\n\nTherefore, if we know that the cake is chocolate, we can infer that the muffins must be blueberry. However, if we do not know whether the cake is chocolate or not, we cannot infer that the muffins are blueberry.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
