Joe went to the park.\n\nWe need to determine whether we can infer that Lucy went to the zoo based on these two statements.\n\nTo do this, we need to follow the rules of logical inference. We can use the first statement to infer that Lucy went to the zoo, but only if we can infer that Joe went to the park.\n\nSo, we need to ask ourselves if we can infer that Joe went to the park based on the second statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
