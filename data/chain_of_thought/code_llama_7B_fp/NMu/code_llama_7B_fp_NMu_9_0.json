This possibility is not necessarily certain, as there may be other factors that could have influenced Lisa's decision.\n\n'Lisa might not have bought the red shirt' is a weaker statement than 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt', as it does not rule out the possibility that Lisa did buy the red shirt. However, it does suggest that there is a possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'Lisa might not have bought the red shirt' from 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
