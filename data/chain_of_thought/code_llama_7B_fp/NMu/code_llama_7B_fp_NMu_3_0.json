This possibility is not necessarily a certainty, but it is a possibility.\n\n'The book might not have been written by James' is a weaker statement than 'It's not the case that the book must have been written by James'. It does not necessarily imply that the book was not written by James, but rather suggests that there is a possibility that it was not.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The book might not have been written by James' from 'It's not the case that the book must have been written by James', but we cannot infer 'The book was not written by James' from 'It's not the case that the book must have been written by James'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
