This does not necessarily mean that the alien did not visit Mars, but rather that the assumption that it did is not supported by the evidence.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the alien might not have visited Mars based solely on the fact that the assumption that it did is not true. However, if there is additional evidence that suggests the alien did not visit Mars, then we could infer that it did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: No.",
