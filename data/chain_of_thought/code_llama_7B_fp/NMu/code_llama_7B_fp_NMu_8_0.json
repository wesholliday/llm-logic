This does not necessarily mean that the vampire was not awake, but rather that it is not the case that the vampire must have been awake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the vampire was not awake based on this statement alone. We need more information or context to make a conclusion about the vampire's state of being.\n\nAnswer: No.",
