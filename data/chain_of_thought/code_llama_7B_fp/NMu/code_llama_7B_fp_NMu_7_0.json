In other words, it is possible that Alex did not finish the race, even if it is not the case that he must have done so.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'Alex might not have finished the race', as there is no necessary connection between finishing the race and the truth of the statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
