This statement does not necessarily imply that the griffin was not in the forest, but rather that it is not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the griffin might not have been in the forest based on this statement alone. We would need additional information or evidence to support this inference.\n\nAnswer: No.",
