It does not necessarily mean that the sunglasses are not in her bag, but rather that the statement \"the sunglasses must be in her bag\" is not true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the sunglasses might not be in her bag based on this statement alone. We would need additional information or evidence to make such an inference.\n\nAnswer: No.",
