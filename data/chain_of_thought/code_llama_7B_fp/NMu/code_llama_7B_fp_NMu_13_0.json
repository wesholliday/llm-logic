It does not necessarily mean that the toy is not in the toy box, but rather that the toy is not necessarily in the toy box.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the toy might not be in the toy box based on this statement alone. We need more information or context to make this inference.\n\nAnswer: No.",
