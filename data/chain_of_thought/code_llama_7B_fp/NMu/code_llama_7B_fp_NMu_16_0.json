This does not necessarily mean that the pen is not in my bag, but rather that the assumption that it must be in my bag is not valid.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the pen might not be in my bag based on this statement alone. We would need additional information or evidence to support this inference.\n\nAnswer: No.",
