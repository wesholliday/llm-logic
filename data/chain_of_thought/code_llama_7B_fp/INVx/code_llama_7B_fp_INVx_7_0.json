The syllogism is structured as follows:\n\n1. If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\n2. If the whiffle was not shanked, then the whiffle did not tink.\n\nTo infer the conclusion, we need to use the principle of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot both be true and false at the same time. Therefore, if the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked, and if the whiffle was not shanked, then the whiffle did not tink.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
