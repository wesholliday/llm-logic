In this case, the antecedent is \"If the shank was plooked.\"\n\nThe statement \"If the shank was not plooked, then the shank was not nugged\" is also a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is false. In this case, the antecedent is \"If the shank was not plooked.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"If the shank was not plooked, then the shank was not nugged\" is logically equivalent to \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\" This means that if the shank was not plooked, then it was not nugged, regardless of whether or not it was plooked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
