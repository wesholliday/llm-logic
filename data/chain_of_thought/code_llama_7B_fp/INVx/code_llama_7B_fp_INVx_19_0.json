            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that uses reasoning to draw a conclusion based on two or more premises. The premises are the given statements, and the conclusion is the statement that we want to draw.\n\nIn this case, the premises are:\n\n1. If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\n2. The smonk was not vreebled.\n\nThe conclusion we want to draw is:\n\n3. If the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk was not plagged.\n\nTo draw this conclusion, we need to use the first premise to infer the second premise. We can do this by using the following reasoning:\n\n1. If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\n2. The smonk was not vreebled.\n3. Therefore, the smonk was not plagged.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premises, and we can infer that if the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk was not plagged.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
