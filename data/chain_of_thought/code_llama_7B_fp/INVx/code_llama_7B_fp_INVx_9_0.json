In this case, the condition is that the twonk was plinked.\n\nTo infer the opposite of this statement, we need to negate the condition and then negate the conclusion. So, if the statement is \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished,\" then the opposite statement would be \"If the twonk was not plinked, then it was not varnished.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
