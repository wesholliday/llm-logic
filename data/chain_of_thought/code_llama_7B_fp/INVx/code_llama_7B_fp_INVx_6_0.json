            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a complex sentence that contains a conditional tense. The sentence is structured as follows:\n\nIf the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nTo infer the opposite of the given statement, we need to analyze the sentence structure and the meaning of the words used.\n\nFirstly, the sentence is in the conditional tense, which means that it is a hypothetical statement that is based on a condition. In this case, the condition is that the grommet was sploffed.\n\nSecondly, the sentence contains a subjunctive mood, which is a form of the verb \"to be\" that is used to express a wish, a suggestion, or a condition that is not necessarily true. In this case, the subjunctive mood is used to express the idea that the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nThirdly, the sentence is structured as a cause-and-effect relationship, where the grommet being sploffed is the cause and the grommet plopping the frink is the effect.\n\nNow, to infer the opposite of the given statement, we need to analyze the meaning of the words used and the structure of the sentence.\n\nIf the grommet was not sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink.\n\nThis statement is a direct opposite of the given statement, as it is a hypothetical statement that is based on the opposite condition. The subjunctive mood is still used to express a wish or a suggestion, but the meaning is now the opposite of what it was in the given statement.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes.",
