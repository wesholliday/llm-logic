            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a conditional sentence, and it is not clear whether the negation of the antecedent is the same as the negation of the consequent. In this case, the negation of the antecedent is \"If the sneg was not crampled,\" and the negation of the consequent is \"If the sneg did not sprot the frink.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer the negation of the consequent from the negation of the antecedent, we need to consider the meaning of the words \"not\" and \"did not\" in the given sentence.\n\n\"Not\" means \"lacking\" or \"absent,\" and it is used to indicate the absence of a particular quality or characteristic. For example, \"The sneg was not crampled\" means that the sneg did not have the quality of being crampled.\n\n\"Did not\" is a past tense form of the verb \"do not,\" and it is used to indicate that something did not happen in the past. For example, \"The sneg did not sprot the frink\" means that the sneg did not spring the frink in the past.\n\nTherefore, if the antecedent is \"If the sneg was not crampled,\" then the negation of the antecedent is \"If the sneg was crampled,\" and the negation of the consequent is \"If the sneg did not sprot the frink.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
