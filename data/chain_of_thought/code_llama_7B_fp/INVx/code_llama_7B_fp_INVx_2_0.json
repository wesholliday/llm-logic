The conditional statement is \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\" To infer the opposite of this statement, we need to analyze the sentence and identify the conditions under which the wug bimmed the zoint.\n\nThe first condition is that the wug was flooped. If the wug was flooped, then it is likely that the wug bimmed the zoint. However, if the wug was not flooped, then it is possible that the wug did not bim the zoint.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"If the wug was not flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
