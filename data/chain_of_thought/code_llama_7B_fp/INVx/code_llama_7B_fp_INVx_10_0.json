            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that uses reasoning to draw a conclusion based on two or more premises. The premises are the given statements, and the conclusion is the statement that we want to draw.\n\nIn this case, the premises are:\n\n1. If the wug was sproonged, then it was garpled.\n2. The wug was not sproonged.\n\nThe conclusion we want to draw is:\n\n3. If the wug was not sproonged, then it was not garpled.\n\nTo draw this conclusion, we need to use the first premise to infer the second premise. We can do this by using the following reasoning:\n\n1. If the wug was sproonged, then it was garpled.\n2. The wug was not sproonged.\n3. Therefore, if the wug was not sproonged, then it was not garpled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the third premise from the first two premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
