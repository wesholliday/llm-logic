In this case, the first condition is that the smip was shripped, and the second condition is that the smip lupped the zoint.\n\nTo infer the opposite of this statement, we need to negate the second condition and then negate the first condition. So, the opposite of \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint\" would be \"If the smip was not shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
