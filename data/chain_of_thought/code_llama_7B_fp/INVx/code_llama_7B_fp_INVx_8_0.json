In this case, the condition is that the sprocket was cranked.\n\nTo infer the opposite of this statement, we need to negate the condition. If the sprocket was not cranked, then the statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" would not be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"If the sprocket was not cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
