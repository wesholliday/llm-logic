However, this does not necessarily mean that the opposite of the premise (the flugel was not blimmed) implies the opposite of the conclusion (the flugel was not zargled).\n\nFor example, if the flugel was blimmed, then it is possible that it was not zargled, but it is also possible that it was zargled despite being blimmed. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the flugel was not blimmed, then it was not zargled.\n\nAnswer: No.",
