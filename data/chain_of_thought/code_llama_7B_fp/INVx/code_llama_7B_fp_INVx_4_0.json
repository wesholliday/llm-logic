            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a conditional sentence, and it can be rephrased as \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\" This means that if the fribble was snurgled, then it crinked.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Can we infer 'If the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink'?\" This is a different conditional sentence, and it is asking whether we can infer the opposite of the original statement.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to look at the meaning of the words \"if\" and \"then\" in the original statement. The word \"if\" means \"under certain conditions,\" and the word \"then\" means \"and the result is that.\"\n\nSo, in the original statement, if the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked. This means that the fribble crinked only if it was snurgled.\n\nNow, let's consider the question. If the fribble was not snurgled, then it did not crink. This means that if the fribble was not snurgled, then it did not crink, regardless of whether it was snurgled or not.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink.\" This is the opposite of the original statement, but it is still a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
