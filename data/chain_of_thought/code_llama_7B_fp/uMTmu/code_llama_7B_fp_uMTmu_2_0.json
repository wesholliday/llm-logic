It means that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn must also be in the forest.\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest\" is a contradiction. It means that it is not true that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest. This is because the first statement implies that the griffin was in the forest, and the second statement contradicts that implication.",
