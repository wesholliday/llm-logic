            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\" is a conditional statement that implies a relationship between the two variables. It states that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal.\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal\" is a negative statement that contradicts the conditional statement. It states that the truck does not have to be metal.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the doll was not plastic. This is because the conditional statement implies that the truck must be metal if the doll is plastic, but the negative statement contradicts this implication.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
