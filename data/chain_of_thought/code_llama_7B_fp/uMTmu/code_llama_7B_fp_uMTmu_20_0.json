In this case, the antecedent is \"the apple was red.\"\n\nThe statement \"it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow\" is a negation of the conditional statement, which means that it is true if the antecedent is false. In this case, the antecedent is also false, since the banana is not necessarily yellow.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the apple was not red, since the conditional statement is false and the negation of the conditional statement is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
