In this case, the first condition is \"If Jeff played basketball,\" and the second condition is \"then Amy must have played tennis.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the second condition: \"then Amy must have played tennis.\" This condition is a necessary condition for the first condition to be true. In other words, if the first condition is true, then the second condition must also be true.\n\nSo, if the first condition is false, then the second condition is also false. In this case, if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
