It means that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake. This implies that the mummy is awake if the vampire is awake.\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake\" is a contradiction. It means that it is not true that the mummy must have been awake. This contradicts the previous statement, which implies that the mummy must have been awake if the vampire is awake.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
