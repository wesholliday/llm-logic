It means that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. However, it does not necessarily follow that the book was not written by James.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the book was not written by James based on the fact that it is not a mystery novel. We need more information to make a conclusion about the authorship of the book.\n\nAnswer: No",
