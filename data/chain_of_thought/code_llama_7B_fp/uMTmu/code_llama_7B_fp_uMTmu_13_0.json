In this case, the first condition is \"the car was red\" and the second condition is \"the truck must have been blue.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the second part of the statement: \"it's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\" This statement is a negation of the second condition, which means that it is a statement that expresses the opposite of the second condition.\n\nNow, let's combine the two statements:\n\n\"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\"\n\nThis statement is a conditional statement that expresses a relationship between two conditions. The first condition is \"the car was red\" and the second condition is \"the truck must have been blue.\" The second part of the statement is a negation of the second condition, which means that it is a statement that expresses the opposite of the second condition.\n\nNow, let's ask the question: Can we infer that the car was not red?\n\nThe answer is yes. If the car was red and the truck must have been blue, then it is not possible for the truck to be blue, because the first condition \"the car was red\" is true. Therefore, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
