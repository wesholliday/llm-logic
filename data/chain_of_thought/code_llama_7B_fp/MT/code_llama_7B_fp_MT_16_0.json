We can do this by using a logical deduction process.\n\nStep 1: We know that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\nStep 2: We also know that the pants were not denim.\n\nNow, we can use the information from step 1 and step 2 to make an inference about the shirt. We can say that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. But if the pants were not denim, then the shirt cannot have been cotton. Therefore, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
