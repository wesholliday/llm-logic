            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer \"The book was not written by James\" from \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" and \"The book is not a mystery novel,\" we need to use logical reasoning.\n\nFirst, we can infer that \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is a conditional statement, where \"If\" is the condition and \"then\" is the conclusion.\n\nSecond, we can infer that \"The book is not a mystery novel\" is a statement that is not true.\n\nThird, we can use the principle of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time. Therefore, if \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is true, then \"The book is not a mystery novel\" must be false.\n\nFourth, we can use the principle of excluded middle, which states that every statement is either true or false. Therefore, if \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is true, then \"The book is not a mystery novel\" must be false, and if \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is false, then \"The book is not a mystery novel\" must be true.\n\nFifth, we can use the principle of non-contradiction again to infer that \"The book was not written by James\" is true. If \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is true, then \"The book is not a mystery novel\" must be false, and if \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is false, then \"The book is not a mystery novel\" must be true. Therefore, \"The book was not written by James\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
