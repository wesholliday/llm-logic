If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n2. The mummy was not awake.\n\nNow, we need to use the first premise to infer that the mummy was awake. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake, because the first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. Therefore, we can conclude that the mummy was not awake, because we have already established that the mummy was not awake in the second premise.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the vampire was not awake, because if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would have been awake, but we have already established that the mummy was not awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
