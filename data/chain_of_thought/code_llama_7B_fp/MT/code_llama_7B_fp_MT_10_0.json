The first premise states that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. This means that if the dog was inside, then the cat was not inside.\n\nThe second premise states that the cat was not outside. This means that the cat was either inside or not outside.\n\nNow, we need to use the first premise to infer that the dog was inside. If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. Therefore, we can infer that the dog was inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
