The premises are independent statements, and they do not contain any contradictory information.\n2. The conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises, and it is not necessarily true.\n3. The conclusion is not necessarily true, but it is a possible conclusion that can be drawn from the premises.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the conclusion \"The cake was not chocolate\" from the premises \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" and \"The muffins were not blueberry.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
