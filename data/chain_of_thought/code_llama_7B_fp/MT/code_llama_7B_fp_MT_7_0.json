Chris did not finish the race.\n\nTo infer whether Alex did not finish the race, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements. The first statement implies that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This means that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race.\n\nNow, we have the second statement, which states that Chris did not finish the race. This means that Chris did not finish the race, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
