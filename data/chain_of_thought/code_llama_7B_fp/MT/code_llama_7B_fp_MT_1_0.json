Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nTo infer whether Mary was not at the wedding, we need to analyze the given statements and their logical relationships.\n\nFirstly, we need to determine whether the first statement is true or false. If the first statement is true, then we can infer that Sue was at the wedding, and if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding. However, if the first statement is false, then we cannot infer anything about Mary's attendance at the wedding.\n\nSecondly, we need to determine whether the second statement is true or false. If the second statement is true, then we can infer that Sue was not at the wedding, and if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding. However, if the second statement is false, then we cannot infer anything about Mary's attendance at the wedding.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot infer anything about Mary's attendance at the wedding. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nAnswer: No",
