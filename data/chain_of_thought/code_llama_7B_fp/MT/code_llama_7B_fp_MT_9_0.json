            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer whether Lisa did not buy the red shirt, we need to analyze the given information and the conclusion we want to draw.\n\nThe given information is:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n2. Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nThe conclusion we want to draw is:\n\n3. Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nTo draw this conclusion, we need to use logical reasoning and the given information. We can start by analyzing the first premise:\n\nIf Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nThis premise implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. It does not necessarily mean that Lisa bought the red shirt, but it does imply that if she did buy it, then Mark would have bought the blue shirt.\n\nNext, we consider the second premise:\n\nMark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nThis premise tells us that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. It does not necessarily mean that he did not buy the red shirt, but it does tell us that he did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nNow, we need to use the two premises to draw the conclusion:\n\nLisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nTo do this, we need to consider the implications of the two premises. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark would have bought the blue shirt. But since Mark did not buy the blue shirt, it follows that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can draw is:\n\nLisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
