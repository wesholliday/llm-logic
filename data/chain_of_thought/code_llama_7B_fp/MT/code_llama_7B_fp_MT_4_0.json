The robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nTo infer whether the alien visited Mars or not, we need to consider the relationship between the statements. The first statement implies that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. This means that if the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nHowever, the second statement states that the robot did not visit Jupiter. This means that the robot did not visit Jupiter, regardless of whether the alien visited Mars or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the alien did not visit Mars based on the given statements.",
