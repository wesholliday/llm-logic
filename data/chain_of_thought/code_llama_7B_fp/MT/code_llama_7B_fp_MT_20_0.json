The banana was not yellow.\n\nTo infer whether the apple was not red, we need to analyze the given statements and their logical relationships.\n\nFirstly, we need to determine whether the first statement is a logical consequence of the second statement. In other words, we need to determine whether the first statement is true if and only if the second statement is true.\n\nIf the first statement is true, then the banana was yellow, which means that the apple was not red. Therefore, if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow, and the apple was not red.\n\nOn the other hand, if the second statement is true, then the banana was not yellow, which means that the apple was not red. Therefore, if the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the apple was not red if and only if the banana was not yellow.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
