This means that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nSecondly, we know that Lucy did not go to the zoo. This means that Lucy did not go to the zoo, regardless of whether Joe went to the park or not.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
