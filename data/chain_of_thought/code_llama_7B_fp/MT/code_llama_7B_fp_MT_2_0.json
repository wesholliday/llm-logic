The first premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. The second premise states that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. The griffin was in the forest and the unicorn was not in the forest. In this case, the first premise is true, but the second premise is false, which means the conclusion cannot be drawn.\n2. The griffin was not in the forest and the unicorn was not in the forest. In this case, both premises are false, which means the conclusion cannot be drawn.\n3. The griffin was in the forest and the unicorn was in the forest. In this case, both premises are true, which means the conclusion can be drawn.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
