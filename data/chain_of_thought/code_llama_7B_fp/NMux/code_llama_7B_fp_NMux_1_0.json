This means that the flugel was not necessarily blimmed, and it is possible that it was not blimmed at all.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flugel might not have been blimmed, as the sentence \"It's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed\" suggests that the flugel was not necessarily blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
