When we say \"The smonk might not have been vreebled,\" we are suggesting that it is possible that the smonk was not vreebled, but we are not certain.\n\nTherefore, based on the meaning of \"might\" and the relationship between the two sentences, we can infer that \"The smonk might not have been vreebled\" from \"It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
