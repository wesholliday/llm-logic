It does not necessarily mean that the sprocket was not cranked, but rather that it was not necessarily cranked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the sprocket might not have been cranked based on this statement alone. We would need additional information or evidence to make such an inference.\n\nAnswer: No.",
