            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The application must have been completed online and included references\" implies that the application was completed online, but it also explicitly states that it included references. The phrase \"and included references\" is a separate condition that is added to the main condition of being completed online. This suggests that the inclusion of references is a requirement, regardless of how the application was completed. Therefore, we can infer that the application must have included references, regardless of whether it was completed online or not.\n\nAnswer: yes"
