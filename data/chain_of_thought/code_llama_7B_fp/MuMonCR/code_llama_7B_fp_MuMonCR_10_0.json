            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical inference problem. To determine if we can infer 'The document must have been notarized' from 'The document must have been signed and notarized', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. The word 'and' is a conjunction that indicates both conditions must be met. Since 'signed' is a necessary condition for 'notarized', we can infer that if the document must have been signed and notarized, then it must have been notarized.\n\nAnswer: yes"
