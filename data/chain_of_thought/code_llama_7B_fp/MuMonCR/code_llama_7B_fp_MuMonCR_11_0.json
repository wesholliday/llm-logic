The word 'and' is a conjunction that indicates a logical conjunction, meaning both actions (updating and restarting) must have occurred. If the software was only updated, it doesn't necessarily mean it was restarted. However, since the statement explicitly mentions both actions together, we can infer that the software was indeed restarted as part of the process.\n\nAnswer: yes"
