The original statement is a conjunction of two premises: \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM\" and \"The meeting must have been in the conference room\". The conclusion we are trying to draw is a separate statement, \"The meeting must have been in the conference room\". \n\nHowever, the conclusion is already present in one of the premises, which means that the conclusion is not being logically derived from the premises. In other words, the conclusion is not a new piece of information that can be inferred from the premises. It's simply a repetition of one of the premises.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The meeting must have been in the conference room\" from the original statement, because it's already stated in the premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
