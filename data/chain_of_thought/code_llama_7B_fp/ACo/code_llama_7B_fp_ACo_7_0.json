If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nTo infer whether Alex finished the race, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements. The first statement states that Chris finished the race, and the second statement states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that Alex finished the race if and only if Chris finished the race. This is because the second statement implies that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race, which means that Alex finishing the race implies that Chris finished the race.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes, we can infer that Alex finished the race based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
