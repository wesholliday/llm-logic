The first statement tells us that Erin took a train, and the second statement tells us that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane. This is because the second statement implies that if Sam took a plane, then Erin would have taken a train instead. Since Erin did take a train, it follows that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
