The conditional statement implies that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This means that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Tom did not watch football, because if he did, then Jen would have watched basketball.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
