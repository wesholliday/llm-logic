If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The griffin was in the forest,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nStep 1: We start by considering the first premise, \"The unicorn was in the forest.\" This premise tells us that the unicorn was in the forest at some point in time.\n\nStep 2: We then consider the second premise, \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This premise tells us that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was also in the forest.\n\nStep 3: We use the information from the first premise to infer that the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nStep 4: We use the information from the second premise to infer that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was also in the forest.\n\nStep 5: We conclude that the griffin was in the forest, since we have inferred that the griffin was in the forest based on the information from the second premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
