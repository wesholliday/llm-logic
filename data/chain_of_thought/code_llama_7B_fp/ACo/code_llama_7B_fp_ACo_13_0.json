If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n\nTo infer the car was red, we need to use the conditional statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This statement implies that if the car was red, then the truck would also be blue. However, we are given that the truck is blue, which means that the car must also be blue. Therefore, we can infer that the car was red.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
