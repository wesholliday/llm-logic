If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nTo infer the apple was red, we need to use the conditional statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This statement implies that if the apple is red, then the banana will be yellow. However, we are given that the banana is yellow, which means that the apple must be red. Therefore, we can infer that the apple was red.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
