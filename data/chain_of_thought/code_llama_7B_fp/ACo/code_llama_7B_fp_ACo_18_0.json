If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The doll was plastic,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we can infer that the doll was not metal, because if it was metal, then the truck would not have been metal. This is because the premise \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" implies that the doll being plastic implies the truck being metal.\n\nSecond, we can infer that the doll was not plastic, because if it was plastic, then it would have been metal. This is because the premise \"The truck was metal\" implies that the truck is not plastic.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
