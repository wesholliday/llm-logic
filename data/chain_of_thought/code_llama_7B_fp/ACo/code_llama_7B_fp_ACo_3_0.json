This is a tautology, which means that the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nSecond, we can infer 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' from 'The book was written by James'. This is a conditional statement, which means that the conclusion follows from the premise if the premise is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The book was written by James' from 'The book is a mystery novel' together with 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel'. This is a logical inference, and we can conclude that 'The book was written by James'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
