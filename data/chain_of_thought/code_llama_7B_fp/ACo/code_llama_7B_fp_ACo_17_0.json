The first sentence states that Kate ate salad, and the second sentence states that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that Ben ate pasta if and only if Kate ate salad. This is because the second sentence implies that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad, which means that Ben ate pasta only if Kate ate salad.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is yes, we can infer that Ben ate pasta based on the information provided in the two sentences.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
