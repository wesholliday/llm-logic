In this case, the antecedent is \"the vampire was awake.\"\n\nThe statement \"The mummy was awake\" is a simple statement that is true.\n\nTherefore, if the antecedent is true, then the conditional statement is also true. However, if the antecedent is false, then the conditional statement is false, regardless of the truth value of the consequent (the part after the \"then\").\n\nSo, to answer your question, it does not necessarily follow that \"The vampire was awake\" is true, because the antecedent is not necessarily true.",
