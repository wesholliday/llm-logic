This means that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den, but it does not necessarily mean that the bear was in the cave.\n\nThe statement \"The wolf was in the den\" is true, but it does not necessarily mean that the bear was in the cave. The wolf could have been in the den for any number of reasons, and it does not necessarily mean that the bear was in the cave.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that \"The bear was in the cave\" is true.",
