In this case, the antecedent is \"the apple was red\" and the consequent is \"the banana was yellow\".\n\nThe statement \"The banana was yellow\" is also true, so if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true. Therefore, if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true, and the conditional statement is true.\n\nSo, if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true, and the conditional statement is true. However, we are not given any information about the antecedent being true or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the apple was red based on the conditional statement alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
