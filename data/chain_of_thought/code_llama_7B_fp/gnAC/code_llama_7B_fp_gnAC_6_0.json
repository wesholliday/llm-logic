This means that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta either.\n\nThe statement \"Bob chose pasta\" is true, but it does not necessarily mean that Sue chose pizza. It is possible that Bob chose pasta without Sue choosing pizza.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that \"Sue chose pizza\" is true. It is possible that Sue chose something else, or that she did not choose anything at all.\n\nAnswer: No.",
