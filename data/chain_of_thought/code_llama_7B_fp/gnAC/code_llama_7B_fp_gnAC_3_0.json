This means that if the book is a mystery novel, then it must have been written by James.\n\nHowever, the statement \"The book is a mystery novel\" does not necessarily imply that the book was written by James. It only states that the book is a mystery novel, without specifying who wrote it.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that \"The book was written by James\" is true. It is possible that the book was written by someone else, even if it is a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: No.",
