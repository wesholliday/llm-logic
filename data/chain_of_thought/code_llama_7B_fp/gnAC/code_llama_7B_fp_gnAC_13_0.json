In this case, the antecedent is \"the car was red\" and the consequent is \"the truck was blue\".\n\nThe statement \"The truck was blue\" is also true, so if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true. Therefore, if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true, and we can conclude that \"The car was red\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
