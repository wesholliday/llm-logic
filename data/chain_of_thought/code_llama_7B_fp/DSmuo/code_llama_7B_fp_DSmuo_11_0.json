Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The newspaper is in the driveway,\" we need to use logical reasoning to deduce it from the given premises.\n\nStep 1: Negation\n\nThe first premise states that it's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch. This means that the newspaper cannot be sitting on the porch.\n\nStep 2: Disjunction\n\nThe second premise states that either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch. This means that if the newspaper is not sitting on the porch, it must be in the driveway.\n\nStep 3: Inference\n\nBased on the above two steps, we can infer that if the newspaper is not sitting on the porch, it must be in the driveway. Therefore, the conclusion \"The newspaper is in the driveway\" follows logically from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
