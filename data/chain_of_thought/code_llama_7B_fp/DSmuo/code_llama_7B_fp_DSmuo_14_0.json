Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The milk is on the counter,\" we need to consider the possible interpretations of the given premises and the relationship between them.\n\n1. The first premise states that it's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge. This means that the milk can be in any state, including being on the counter.\n2. The second premise states that either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge. This means that if the milk is not on the counter, it must be chilling in the fridge.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the milk is on the counter, as it is not chilling in the fridge and is not necessarily on the counter.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
