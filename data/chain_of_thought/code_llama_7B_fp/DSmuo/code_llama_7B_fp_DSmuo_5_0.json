This premise states that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, which means they must be in the jar.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise: 'Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry'. This premise states that either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry.\n\nSince the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, and the second premise states that either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry, we can infer that the cookies must be in the jar.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
