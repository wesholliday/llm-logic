Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The book is on the shelf,\" we need to use logical reasoning to connect the given premises.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the book must be resting on the table by negating the first premise. This gives us:\n\n\"The book must not be resting on the table.\"\n\nNext, we can use the second premise to infer that either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table. This gives us:\n\n\"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\n\nNow, we can use the law of excluded middle to infer that either the book is on the shelf or it is not on the shelf. This gives us:\n\n\"The book is on the shelf or the book is not on the shelf.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
