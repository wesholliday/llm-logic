Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The watch is charging on the dresser,\" we need to consider the following:\n\n* The first premise states that the watch is not on his wrist, which means it cannot be on his wrist.\n* The second premise states that either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\n* Since the watch is not on his wrist, the only other option is that it is charging on the dresser.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
