The first premise states that the sunglasses are not perched on her head, and the second premise states that either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\n\nIf the sunglasses are not perched on her head, then it is possible that they are in her bag. This is because the second premise states that either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head. If the sunglasses are not perched on her head, then it is not necessary that they are in her bag, but it is possible.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
