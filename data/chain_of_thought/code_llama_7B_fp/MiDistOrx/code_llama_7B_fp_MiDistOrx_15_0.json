The word \"or\" is a logical operator that indicates an exclusive disjunction, meaning that the quazzle can only be one of the options listed. Therefore, we can infer that the quazzle is not necessarily flibbit, but rather it is one of the other two options: quibble grazzle glorp or it might be the other option, but not both."
