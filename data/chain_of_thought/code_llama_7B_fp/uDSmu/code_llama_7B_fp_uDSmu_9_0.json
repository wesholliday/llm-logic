It implies that the missing puzzle piece is either in the box or it is not in the box, but it also implies that the missing puzzle piece is not in the box. This is a contradiction because it is impossible for something to be in two places at the same time.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: No.",
