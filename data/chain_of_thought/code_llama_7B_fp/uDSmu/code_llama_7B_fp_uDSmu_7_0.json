It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\n\nWe can infer that the umbrella is in the car because the first statement implies that the umbrella is either in the car or tucked away in the closet, and the second statement contradicts the idea that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet. Therefore, the only possibility is that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
