It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\n\nWe can infer that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack because the first statement implies that the scarf is either in my backpack or on the coat rack, and the second statement contradicts the idea that the scarf must be on the coat rack. Therefore, the scarf must be in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
