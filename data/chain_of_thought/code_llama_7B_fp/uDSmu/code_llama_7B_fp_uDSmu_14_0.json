Also, it's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n\nFrom this statement, we can infer that the milk is on the counter. Here's why:\n\n1. The first part of the statement, \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge,\" implies that the milk is either on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\n2. The second part of the statement, \"Also, it's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge,\" contradicts the first part of the statement. This means that the milk cannot be chilling in the fridge, which means it must be on the counter.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
