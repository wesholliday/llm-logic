It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that the newspaper is either in the driveway or it is not in the driveway.\n\nFrom the second statement, we can infer that the newspaper is not sitting on the porch.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nIn this scenario, the newspaper is in the driveway, which means it is not sitting on the porch. This contradicts the second statement, so it is not possible for the newspaper to be in the driveway.\n\nScenario 2: The newspaper is not in the driveway.\n\nIn this scenario, the newspaper is not in the driveway, which means it is not sitting on the porch. This also contradicts the second statement, so it is not possible for the newspaper to be not in the driveway.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that it is not possible to infer that the newspaper is in the driveway based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
