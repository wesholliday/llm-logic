It is not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can conclude that the remote control is either on the coffee table or it is somewhere else.\n\nFrom the second statement, we can conclude that the remote control is not hiding under the couch.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the remote control is on the coffee table. If it is on the coffee table, then it is not hiding under the couch, which means that the second statement is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
