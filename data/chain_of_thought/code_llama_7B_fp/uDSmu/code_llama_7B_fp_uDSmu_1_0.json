It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n\nWe can infer that Fido is inside because the first statement implies that Fido is either inside or in the garden, and the second statement contradicts the first statement by saying that Fido must not be in the garden. Therefore, if the first statement is true, then Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
