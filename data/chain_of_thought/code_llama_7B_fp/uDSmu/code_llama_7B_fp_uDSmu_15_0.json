It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door.\n\nWe can infer that the shoes are in the closet because the first statement implies that the shoes are either in the closet or lined up by the door. If the shoes are not lined up by the door, then they must be in the closet. The second statement does not contradict this inference, as it only states that it is not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door, which is not the same as saying that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
