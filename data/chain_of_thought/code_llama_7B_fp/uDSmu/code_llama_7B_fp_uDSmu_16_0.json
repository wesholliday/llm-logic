It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\n\nWe can infer that the pen is in my bag because the first statement implies that the pen is either in my bag or on my desk, and the second statement contradicts the first statement by saying that the pen cannot be on my desk. Therefore, the only possibility is that the pen is in my bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
