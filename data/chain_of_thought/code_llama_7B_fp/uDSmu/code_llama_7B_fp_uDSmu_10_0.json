It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\n\nWe can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket because the first statement implies that the missing sock is either in the laundry basket or under the bed, and the second statement contradicts the possibility that the missing sock must be under the bed. Therefore, the missing sock must be in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
