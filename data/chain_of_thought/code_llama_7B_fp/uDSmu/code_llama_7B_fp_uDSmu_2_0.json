It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\n\nWe can infer that the book is on the shelf because the first statement implies that the book is either on the shelf or resting on the table, and the second statement contradicts the first statement by saying that the book cannot be resting on the table. Therefore, the only possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
