We are also given the additional information that it is not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\n\nTo determine whether the jacket is draped over the chair, we need to consider the information provided. If the jacket is draped over the chair, then it is not hanging in the closet, as the chair is not a place where the jacket could be hanging. Therefore, if the jacket is not hanging in the closet, it must be draped over the chair.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
