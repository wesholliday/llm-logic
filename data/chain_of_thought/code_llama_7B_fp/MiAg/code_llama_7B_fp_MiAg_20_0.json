The first statement, 'The scientist might be in the lab', indicates a possibility of the scientist's location. The second statement, 'The scientist might be conducting an experiment', indicates a possibility of the scientist's activity. \n\nHowever, the key to inferring the new statement lies in the relationship between the two given statements. The first statement provides a location (the lab), and the second statement provides an activity (conducting an experiment). Since the activity (conducting an experiment) is often associated with a specific location (a lab), we can reasonably infer that the scientist is conducting the experiment in the lab.\n\nAnswer: yes"
