            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The restaurant might be expensive and busy' from 'The restaurant might be expensive and the restaurant might be busy', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements. The original statement is a conjunction of two independent clauses, each with a modal verb 'might'. The first clause states that the restaurant might be expensive, and the second clause states that the restaurant might be busy. The conjunction 'and' connects these two clauses, indicating that both conditions might be true. However, the conjunction 'and' in this context implies a conjunction of two independent clauses, not a conjunction of two clauses that are already connected by 'and'. Therefore, we can infer that the restaurant might be expensive and the restaurant might be busy, as the two conditions are presented as separate possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes"
