The statement \"Either the cookies are hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar\" implies that the cookies are either in the pantry or in the jar. If the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, then they must be in the jar. The statement \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry\" further confirms that the cookies are in the jar, as it rules out the possibility that they are hidden in the pantry.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
