The statement \"Either the keys are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer\" implies that the keys are either in the cabinet or in the drawer, but not both. Therefore, if we know that the keys aren't dangling in the cabinet, we can conclude that they must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
