Therefore, the conclusion \"The toy is in the toy box\" cannot be inferred from the premises.\n\nOn the other hand, if the toy is not sitting on the shelf, then it must be in the toy box. In this case, the conclusion \"The toy is in the toy box\" can be inferred from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes.",
