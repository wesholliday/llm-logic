The statement says that either the watch is on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser, and that the watch isn't on his wrist.\n\nIf the watch is on his wrist, then it is not charging on the dresser. Therefore, if the watch is on his wrist, we cannot infer that it is charging on the dresser.\n\nOn the other hand, if the watch is not on his wrist, then it must be charging on the dresser. Therefore, if the watch is not on his wrist, we can infer that it is charging on the dresser.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
