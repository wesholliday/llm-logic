Either the missing sock is under the bed or it's in the laundry basket.\n2. The missing sock isn't under the bed.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the missing sock is either under the bed or in the laundry basket. From the second statement, we know that the missing sock is not under the bed.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The missing sock is under the bed.\n\n* If the missing sock is under the bed, then it's not in the laundry basket.\n* Therefore, the missing sock is not in the laundry basket.\n\nScenario 2: The missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\n* If the missing sock is in the laundry basket, then it's not under the bed.\n* Therefore, the missing sock is not under the bed.\n\nBased on the above scenarios, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
