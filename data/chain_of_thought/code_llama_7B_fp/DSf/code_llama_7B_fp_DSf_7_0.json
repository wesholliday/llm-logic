Therefore, the conclusion \"The umbrella is in the car\" is not logically entailed by the premises.\n\nOn the other hand, if the umbrella is not tucked away in the closet, then it is either in the car or not in the car. However, the premise \"The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet\" implies that the umbrella is not in the closet, which rules out the possibility that it is in the car. Therefore, the conclusion \"The umbrella is in the car\" is also not logically entailed by the premises.\n\nIn conclusion, the premises do not logically entail the conclusion \"The umbrella is in the car.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
