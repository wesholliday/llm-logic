The first premise states that either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside. The second premise states that Fido is not in the garden.\n\nIf Fido is in the garden, then the first premise is false, and the second premise is true. This means that Fido is not in the garden, which contradicts the first premise. Therefore, we can conclude that Fido is not in the garden.\n\nOn the other hand, if Fido is not in the garden, then the first premise is true, and the second premise is false. This means that Fido is inside, which contradicts the second premise. Therefore, we can conclude that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
