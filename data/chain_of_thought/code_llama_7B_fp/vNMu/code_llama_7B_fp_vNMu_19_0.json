The premise \"It's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser\" is actually a tautology, which means that it is always true. Therefore, the conclusion \"The watch might not be charging on the dresser\" is also always true, regardless of whether the watch is actually charging on the dresser or not.\n\nIn other words, the argument is not able to reach a conclusion that is different from the premise, which means that it is not logically valid.",
