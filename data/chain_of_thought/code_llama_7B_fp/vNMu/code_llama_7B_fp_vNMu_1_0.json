The premise states that it is not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding, which means that it is possible that Mary was not at the wedding. However, the conclusion states that Mary might not have been at the wedding, which is a possibility that is not necessarily implied by the premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because it does not logically follow from the premise to the conclusion.",
