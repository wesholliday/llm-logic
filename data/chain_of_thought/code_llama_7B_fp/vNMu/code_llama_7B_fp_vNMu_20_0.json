The premise states that it is not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag, which means that it is possible that the sunglasses are not in her bag. However, the conclusion states that the sunglasses might not be in her bag, which is a weaker conclusion than the premise.\n\nIn order for the argument to be logically valid, the conclusion would need to be more specific and certain than the premise. For example, the conclusion could be \"The sunglasses are not in her bag\" or \"It is not the case that the sunglasses are in her bag.\" This would make the argument logically valid because the conclusion is a direct result of the premise and is not a weaker conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No.",
