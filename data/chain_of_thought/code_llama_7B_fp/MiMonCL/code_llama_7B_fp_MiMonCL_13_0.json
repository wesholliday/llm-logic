The original statement \"The weather might be unpredictable and affect travel plans\" implies that the unpredictability of the weather is the reason for the potential impact on travel plans. This means that if the weather is unpredictable, it can affect travel plans. Therefore, we can infer that the weather might be unpredictable.\n\nAnswer: yes"
