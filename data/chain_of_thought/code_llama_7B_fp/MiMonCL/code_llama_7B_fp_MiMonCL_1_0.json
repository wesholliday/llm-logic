The original statement is 'The flibbit might be zorped and gribbled'. The word 'and' is a conjunction that connects two independent clauses, indicating that both actions (being zorped and being gribbled) are possibilities for the flibbit. Since 'might be zorped' is one of the possibilities, we can infer that 'The flibbit might be zorped' is indeed a valid inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
