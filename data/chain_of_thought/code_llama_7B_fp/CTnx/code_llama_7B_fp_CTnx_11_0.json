However, this statement does not necessarily imply that if the flug was zimmed, then it was not blummed.\n\nFor example, consider a situation where the flug was blummed, but it was also zimmed. In this case, the flug was both blummed and zimmed, which contradicts the given statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If the flug was zimmed, then the flug was not blummed\" based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
