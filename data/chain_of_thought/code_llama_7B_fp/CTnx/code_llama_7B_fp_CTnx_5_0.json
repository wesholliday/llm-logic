The first statement is \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled.\" The second statement is \"If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled.\"\n\nTo answer the question, we need to analyze the two statements and determine if they are logically consistent.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement of the form \"If A, then B.\" In this case, A is \"the zinger was fraggled\" and B is \"the zinger was not smoogled.\"\n\nThe second statement is also a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement of the form \"If A, then B.\" In this case, A is \"the zinger was smoogled\" and B is \"the zinger was not fraggled.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the two statements together. If the first statement is true, then the second statement must be false, because if the zinger was fraggled, then it could not have been smoogled. Therefore, we can infer that if the zinger was smoogled, then it was not fraggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
