The statement \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was not spended\" implies that if the dreb was vroombed, then it was not spent, but it does not provide any information about whether the dreb was spent or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer anything from the given statement, and the statement \"If the dreb was spended, then the dreb was not vroombed\" is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
