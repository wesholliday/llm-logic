The statement \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was not zargled\" implies that if the flugel is blimmed, then it is not zargled, but the statement \"If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed\" implies that if the flugel is zargled, then it is not blimmed. These two statements are contradictory, and therefore, they cannot be used together to infer anything.\n\nAnswer: No.",
