This means that the wug was not flooped, and therefore, it did bim the zoint.\n\nHowever, the statement \"If the wug bimmed the zoint, then the wug was not flooped\" implies that if the wug bimmed the zoint, it was not flooped. This is a logical contradiction, as we have already established that the wug was flooped in the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If the wug bimmed the zoint, then the wug was not flooped.\"",
