In this case, the conditions are that the smip was shripped and that the smip did not lup the zoint.\n\nTo infer the opposite of this statement, we need to negate the conditions. So, we can negate the conditions by saying \"If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped.\" This is a conditional statement that is logically equivalent to the original statement, but with the conditions negated.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
