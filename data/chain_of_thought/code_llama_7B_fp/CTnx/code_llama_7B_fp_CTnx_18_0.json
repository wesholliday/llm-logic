The statement \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was not nugged\" implies that if the shank was plooked, then it was not nugged, but the statement \"If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked\" implies that if the shank was nugged, then it was not plooked. These two statements are contradictory, and therefore, they cannot be used together to infer anything.\n\nAnswer: No.",
