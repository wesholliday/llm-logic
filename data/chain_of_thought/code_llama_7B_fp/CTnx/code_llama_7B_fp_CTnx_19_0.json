The statement \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk did not plagged\" implies that if the smonk was vreebled, then it did not plagged, but the statement \"If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled\" implies that if the smonk plagged, then it was not vreebled. These two statements are contradictory, and therefore, they cannot be used together to infer anything.\n\nAnswer: No.",
