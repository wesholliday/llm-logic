The statement \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it did not surn\" is an affirmation of the consequent, which means that it is an instance of the fallacy.\n\nThe fallacy arises from the fact that the statement is based on the assumption that the fleeg was bluttered, which is not necessarily true. Therefore, the statement \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it did not surn\" is not a valid conclusion.\n\nIn order to avoid this fallacy, we need to be careful when making statements that are based on hypothetical or uncertain circumstances. We should not assume that the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise, but rather consider all possible scenarios and their implications.\n\nAnswer: No.",
