This implies that Erin took a train if Sam took a plane.\n\nNow, if 'Erin took a train' is true, then it means that Erin actually took a train. This contradicts the fact that Erin took a train if Sam took a plane, which means that the conditional statement 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' is false.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that 'Sam took a plane' is false.\n\nAnswer: No.",
