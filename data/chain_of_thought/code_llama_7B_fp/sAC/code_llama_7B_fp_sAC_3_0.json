The book is a mystery novel.\n\nWe need to determine whether the following statement is true or false:\n\n3. The book was written by James.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to evaluate the validity of the conditional statement in the first premise. If the conditional statement is true, then the conclusion of the first premise will also be true. Therefore, we need to determine whether the conditional statement is true or false.\n\nThe conditional statement is of the form \"If p, then q.\" It is true if and only if the following conditions are met:\n\n* p is true\n* q is true\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nThe first premise states that the book is a mystery novel, which means that the conditional statement is true. Therefore, the conclusion of the first premise is also true.\n\nTherefore, the conditional statement is true, and the conclusion of the first premise is also true. Therefore, the answer to the question is yes.",
