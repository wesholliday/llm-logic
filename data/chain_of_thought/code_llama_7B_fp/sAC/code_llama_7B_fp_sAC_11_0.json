The muffins were blueberry.\n\nWe know that the second statement is true, so we can infer that the muffins were blueberry.\n\nNow, let's consider the first statement:\n\nIf the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true and the consequent (the part after the \"then\") is true.\n\nIn this case, the antecedent is \"the cake was chocolate,\" and the consequent is \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nWe know that the muffins were blueberry, so we can infer that the cake was chocolate.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
