            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether 'Mary was at the wedding' is true, we need to evaluate the validity of the conditional statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.'\n\nIf the conditional statement is true, then it means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. This implies that Mary was at the wedding if and only if Sue was at the wedding.\n\nSince 'Sue was at the wedding' is true, it means that Sue was at the wedding. However, we don't know whether Mary was at the wedding or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that 'Mary was at the wedding' is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
