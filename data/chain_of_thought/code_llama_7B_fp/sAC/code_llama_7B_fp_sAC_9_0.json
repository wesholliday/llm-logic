            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether the statement 'Lisa bought the red shirt' is true or not, we need to evaluate the conditional statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'. If this statement is true, then it means that Lisa did buy the red shirt, and Mark did buy the blue shirt.\n\nNow, we are given that 'Mark bought the blue shirt' is true. This means that Mark did buy the blue shirt, regardless of whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not.\n\nSo, if the conditional statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is true, then it follows that 'Lisa bought the red shirt' is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
