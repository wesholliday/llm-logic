If this statement is true, then it means that Joe did go to the park, and Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nHowever, we are given that 'Lucy went to the zoo' is true, which means that Lucy did go to the zoo, regardless of whether Joe went to the park or not. Therefore, we can conclude that 'Joe went to the park' is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: No.",
