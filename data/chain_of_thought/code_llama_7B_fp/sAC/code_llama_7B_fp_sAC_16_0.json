The pants were denim.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can conclude that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. This means that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim, and vice versa.\n\nFrom the second statement, we can conclude that the pants were denim. This means that the pants were denim, regardless of whether the shirt was cotton or not.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the shirt was cotton if and only if the pants were denim. In other words, if the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton, but if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
