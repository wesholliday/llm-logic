The truck was metal.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether the conclusion \"The doll was plastic\" is true or not. To do this, we need to apply the rules of logic.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true, then the consequent (the part after the \"then\") must be true. In this case, the antecedent is \"If the doll was plastic,\" and the consequent is \"then the truck was metal.\"\n\nThe second premise is a simple statement, which is \"The truck was metal.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine whether the conclusion \"The doll was plastic\" is true or not. To do this, we need to apply the rules of logic.\n\nIf the first premise is true, then the second premise must be true. This is because the first premise is a conditional statement, and if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must be true. Therefore, if \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is true, then \"The truck was metal\" must also be true.\n\nHowever, we are given that \"The truck was metal\" is true. Therefore, we can conclude that \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The doll was plastic\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
