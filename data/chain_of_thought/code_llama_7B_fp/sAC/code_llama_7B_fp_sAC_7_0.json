            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nLet's analyze the given statement:\n\nIf Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\n\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which means that it has two parts:\n\n1. If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\n2. Chris finished the race is true\n\nThe first part of the statement is a conditional statement, which means that it has a condition (Alex finishing the race) and a consequence (Chris finishing the race). The second part of the statement is a simple statement, which means that it is a statement that is either true or false, without any conditions or consequences.\n\nNow, let's consider the given question:\n\nDoes it follow that 'Alex finished the race' is true?\n\nTo answer this question, we need to look at the relationship between the two statements. The first statement is a conditional statement, and the second statement is a simple statement. If the first statement is true, then the second statement must also be true.\n\nSo, if the first statement is true, then the second statement must also be true. This means that if Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race.\n\nHowever, we are given that Chris finished the race is true. This means that Chris finished the race, which means that Alex finished the race.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is yes. It does follow that 'Alex finished the race' is true.",
