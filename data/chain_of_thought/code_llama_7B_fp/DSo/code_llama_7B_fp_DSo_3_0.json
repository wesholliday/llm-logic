Either the keys are in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The keys are in the drawer,\" we need to consider the possible combinations of the given premises.\n\nIf the keys are in the drawer, then they are not dangling in the cabinet, and the first premise is satisfied. Additionally, the second premise is also satisfied, as the keys are in the drawer and not dangling in the cabinet.\n\nOn the other hand, if the keys are dangling in the cabinet, then the first premise is not satisfied, as the keys are not in the drawer. However, the second premise is still satisfied, as the keys are either in the drawer or dangling in the cabinet.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the conclusion \"The keys are in the drawer\" based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
