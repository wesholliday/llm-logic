This is because the statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch\" implies that if the remote control is not hiding under the couch, then it must be on the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
