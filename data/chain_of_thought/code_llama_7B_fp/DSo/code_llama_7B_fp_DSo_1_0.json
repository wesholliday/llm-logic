Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden.\n\nWe need to determine whether we can infer that Fido is inside based on these two statements.\n\nTo do this, we need to consider the meaning of each statement and how they relate to each other.\n\nThe first statement, \"Fido is not in the garden,\" means that Fido is not located in the garden. This statement does not provide any information about whether Fido is inside or outside the garden.\n\nThe second statement, \"Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden,\" means that Fido is either located inside or in the garden. This statement does not provide any information about whether Fido is inside or outside the garden.\n\nBased on these two statements, we cannot infer that Fido is inside. We only know that Fido is either inside or in the garden, but we do not know which one it is.\n\nAnswer: No.",
