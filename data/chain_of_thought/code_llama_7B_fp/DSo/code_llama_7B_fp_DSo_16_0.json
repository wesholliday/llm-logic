Either the pen is in my bag or it is on my desk.\n\nTo infer the pen is in my bag, we need to consider the possibility that the pen is in my bag, given that it is not on my desk. However, we also need to consider the possibility that the pen is on my desk, given that the statement \"Either the pen is in my bag or it is on my desk\" is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the pen is in my bag based on the given premises alone. We need more information or additional premises to make a conclusion about the pen's location.\n\nAnswer: No.",
