Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it is sitting on the porch.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The newspaper is in the driveway,\" we need to consider the possible combinations of the given premises.\n\nIf the newspaper is sitting on the porch, then the first premise would be false, and the second premise would be true. However, this would lead to a contradiction, as the second premise states that either the newspaper is in the driveway or it is sitting on the porch, but it is sitting on the porch, which means it is not in the driveway.\n\nTherefore, the only possible conclusion is that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
