This is because the first statement states that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor, and we cannot have it both ways. Therefore, we can conclude that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor.\n\nNext, we can use the second statement to our advantage. This statement states that either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it is blending in on the floor. Since we have already determined that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor, we can infer that it must be in the box.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
