Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The book is on the shelf,\" we need to use logical reasoning to connect the given premises.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the book is resting on the table, since the first premise states that it isn't resting on the table. This means that the book must be on the shelf.\n\nSecond, we can use the second premise to confirm that the book is on the shelf. The second premise states that either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table. Since we have already eliminated the possibility that the book is resting on the table, the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the book is on the shelf based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
