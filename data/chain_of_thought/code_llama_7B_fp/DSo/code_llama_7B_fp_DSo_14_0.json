The first statement, \"The milk isn't chilling in the fridge,\" implies that the milk is not in the fridge, which means it must be on the counter. The second statement, \"Either the milk is on the counter or it is chilling in the fridge,\" is a logical contradiction, as it implies that the milk is both on the counter and chilling in the fridge at the same time. This is impossible, so we can conclude that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
