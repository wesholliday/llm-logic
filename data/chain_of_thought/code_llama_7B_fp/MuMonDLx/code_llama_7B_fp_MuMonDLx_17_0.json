However, it does not provide any information about the possibility of the blimple being zizz. The statement does not rule out the possibility of the blimple being zizz, it simply asserts that it must be gribble. Therefore, we cannot infer that the blimple must be gribble or zizz, because the original statement does not provide any information about the blimple being zizz.\n\nAnswer: no"
