            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the additional phrase \"or wump wump wozzle\", we need to analyze the original statement \"The grazzle must be snork on zibble\". This statement is a declarative sentence that presents a fact or a rule. The word \"must\" indicates a necessity or a requirement. The phrase \"snork on zibble\" appears to be a specific action or condition that the grazzle is required to fulfill.\n\nThe question is asking if we can infer that the grazzle must also be able to snork on wump wump wozzle. To make this inference, we would need to have some logical connection between the original statement and the additional phrase. However, there is no apparent logical connection between \"zibble\" and \"wump wump wozzle\". The two phrases seem to be unrelated, and there is no indication that the requirement for snorking on zibble implies a requirement for snorking on wump wump wozzle.\n\nTherefore, based on the original statement alone, we cannot infer that the grazzle must be snork on wump wump wozzle.\n\nAnswer: no"
