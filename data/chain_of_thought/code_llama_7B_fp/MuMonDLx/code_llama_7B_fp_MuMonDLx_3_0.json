However, it does not provide any information about the possibility of the zibber being on the floob. The word \"in\" suggests containment or location within, but it does not exclude the possibility of the zibber being on the surface of the floob. Therefore, we cannot infer that the zibber must be on the floob, only that it must be in it.\n\nAnswer: no"
