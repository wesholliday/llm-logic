Therefore, if the book was written by James, it must be a mystery novel.\n\nHowever, the book might not be a mystery novel. This is because the statement \"the book might not be a mystery novel\" is a possibility that is not necessarily implied by the fact that the book was written by James. It is possible that the book was written by James but is not a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the book was not written by James based solely on the fact that the book might not be a mystery novel. We need more information to make a conclusion about the authorship of the book.\n\nAnswer: No",
