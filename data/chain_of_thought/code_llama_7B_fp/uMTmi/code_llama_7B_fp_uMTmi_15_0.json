Erin might not have taken a train.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nIf Sam did not take a plane, then it is possible that Erin did not take a train. However, this does not necessarily mean that Erin did not take a train, as the second statement only implies that Erin might not have taken a train.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Sam did not take a plane based solely on the given information. We need more information to make a conclusion about Sam's mode of transportation.",
