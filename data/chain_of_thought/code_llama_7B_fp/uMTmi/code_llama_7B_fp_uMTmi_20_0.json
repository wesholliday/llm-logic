This means that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow.\n\nThe second statement \"The banana might not have been yellow\" is a possibility that is not necessarily related to the first statement. It is possible that the banana was not yellow, even if the apple was red.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the apple was not red based on these two statements alone. The first statement implies a causal relationship between the apple's color and the banana's color, but the second statement does not provide any information about the apple's color.\n\nAnswer: No.",
