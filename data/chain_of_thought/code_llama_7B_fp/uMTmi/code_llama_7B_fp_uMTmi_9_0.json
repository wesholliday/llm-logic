Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\n\nWe are asked to infer whether Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider both statements and their implications.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This means that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt either.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. This means that Mark might have bought the blue shirt, or he might not have bought it.\n\nIf Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This is because if Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then he must have bought the red shirt, since the two shirts are the same color.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt if Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
