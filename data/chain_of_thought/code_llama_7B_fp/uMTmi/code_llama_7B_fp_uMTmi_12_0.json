This means that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo either.\n\nThe statement \"Lucy might not have gone to the zoo\" suggests that Lucy did not go to the zoo, but it does not necessarily mean that she did not go to the park.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Joe did not go to the park based on the information provided. We can only conclude that Lucy did not go to the zoo, but we cannot say for certain whether or not Joe went to the park.\n\nAnswer: No.",
