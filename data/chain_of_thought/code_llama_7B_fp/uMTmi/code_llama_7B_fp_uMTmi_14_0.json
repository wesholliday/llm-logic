If the bear is in the cave, then the wolf must be in the den, which is a logical conclusion.\n\nHowever, the statement \"The wolf might not have been in the den\" suggests that the wolf is not always in the den. This means that the wolf may not have been in the den when the bear was in the cave.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the bear was not in the cave based on the information provided. The bear could have been in the cave and the wolf could have been in the den, or the wolf could have been somewhere else entirely.\n\nAnswer: No.",
