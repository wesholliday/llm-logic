It means that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nThe second statement \"The muffins might not have been blueberry\" is a possibility that is not necessarily related to the first statement. It does not contradict the first statement, but it does suggest that the muffins could have been something other than blueberry.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the cake was not chocolate based on these two statements alone. We need more information or evidence to make a conclusion about the cake's flavor.\n\nAnswer: No.",
