Sue might not have been at the wedding.\n\nWe are asked to infer whether Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider both statements and their logical relationships.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This means that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding either.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that Sue might not have been at the wedding. This means that Sue could have been at the wedding or she could not have been at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible combinations of these two statements:\n\n1. Mary was at the wedding and Sue was at the wedding: This is not possible, as we know that Mary was not at the wedding.\n2. Mary was at the wedding and Sue was not at the wedding: This is not possible, as we know that Sue was at the wedding.\n3. Mary was not at the wedding and Sue was at the wedding: This is possible, as we know that Sue might not have been at the wedding.\n4. Mary was not at the wedding and Sue was not at the wedding: This is possible, as we know that Sue might not have been at the wedding.\n\nBased on these possible combinations, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
