            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\" is a conditional statement that implies a causal relationship between the shirt and the pants. It means that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim because cotton and denim are two different types of fabric.\n\nThe second statement \"The pants might not have been denim\" is a possibility that is not necessarily related to the first statement. It simply means that the pants could have been made of a different type of fabric, such as polyester or nylon, rather than denim.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the shirt was not cotton based on these two statements alone. The first statement implies a causal relationship between the shirt and the pants, while the second statement simply provides a possibility that the pants could have been made of a different type of fabric.\n\nAnswer: No.",
