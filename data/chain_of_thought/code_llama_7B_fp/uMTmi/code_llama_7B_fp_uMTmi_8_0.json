It means that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake. This implies that the mummy is awake if the vampire is awake.\n\nThe statement \"The mummy might not have been awake\" is a possibility that is not necessarily related to the first statement. It simply means that the mummy might not have been awake, but it does not necessarily contradict the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the vampire was not awake based on these two statements alone. We need more information or evidence to make a conclusion about the vampire's state of being.\n\nAnswer: No.",
