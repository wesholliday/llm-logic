Jen might not have watched basketball.\n\nWe are asked to infer whether Tom did not watch football.\n\nTo infer this, we need to consider the relationship between Tom and Jen. If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. This means that Tom and Jen are connected in some way, and Jen's actions are influenced by Tom's actions.\n\nHowever, we are also given the information that Jen might not have watched basketball. This means that there is a possibility that Jen did not watch basketball, even if Tom watched football.\n\nSo, we cannot infer that Tom did not watch football based on the information given. It is possible that Tom watched football and Jen did not watch basketball, or that Tom did not watch football and Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nAnswer: No.",
