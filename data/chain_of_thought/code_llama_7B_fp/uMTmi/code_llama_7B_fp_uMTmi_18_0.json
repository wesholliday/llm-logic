The statement \"Also, the truck might not have been metal\" suggests that the truck's material is not necessarily related to the doll's material.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic based on the information provided. The statement \"Also, the truck might not have been metal\" does not provide enough information to make a conclusion about the doll's material.\n\nAnswer: No.",
