It means that if the griffin is in the forest, then it is necessary that the unicorn is also in the forest.\n\nThe statement \"The unicorn might not have been in the forest\" is a possibility. It means that the unicorn is not necessarily in the forest.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the griffin was not in the forest based on these two statements alone. We need more information or evidence to make a conclusion about the griffin's presence in the forest.\n\nAnswer: No.",
