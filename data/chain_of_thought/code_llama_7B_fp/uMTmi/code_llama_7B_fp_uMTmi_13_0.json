However, the statement \"The truck might not have been blue\" does not necessarily contradict this inference. It simply means that the truck might not have been blue, but it does not necessarily mean that the car was not red.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the car was not red based on these two statements alone. We need more information or evidence to make a conclusion about the color of the car.\n\nAnswer: No",
