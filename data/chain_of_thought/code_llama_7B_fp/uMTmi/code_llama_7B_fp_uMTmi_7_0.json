This means that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race either.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race either. This is because if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race either, as they are both competing in the same race.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
