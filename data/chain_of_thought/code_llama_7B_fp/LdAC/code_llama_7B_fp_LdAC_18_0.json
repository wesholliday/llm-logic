            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo deduce \"The doll was plastic\" from \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" and \"The truck was metal,\" we need to follow the rules of logical deduction.\n\n1. The premises are:\n\t* If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\t* The truck was metal.\n2. The conclusion we want to draw is:\n\t* The doll was plastic.\n\nTo deduce the conclusion, we need to use the first premise to infer the second premise. In other words, we need to show that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\n3. We can use the first premise to infer the second premise as follows:\n\t* If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\t* The truck was metal.\n\t* Therefore, if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nTherefore, we can logically deduce \"The doll was plastic\" from \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" and \"The truck was metal.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
