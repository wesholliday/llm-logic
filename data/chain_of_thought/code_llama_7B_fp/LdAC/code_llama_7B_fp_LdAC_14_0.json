This means that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den, but it does not necessarily mean that the bear was in the cave.\n\nThe second premise states that the wolf was in the den. This means that the wolf was in the den, but it does not necessarily mean that the bear was in the cave.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce that the bear was in the cave based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
