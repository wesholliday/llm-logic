However, it does not necessarily mean that Ben ate pasta.\n\nThe second statement is \"Kate ate salad.\" This statement simply states that Kate ate salad, without any additional information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce whether Ben ate pasta or not, based on the given information. The statements do not provide enough information to make a conclusion about Ben's eating habits.\n\nAnswer: No.",
