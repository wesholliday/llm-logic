            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo deduce whether Mary was at the wedding or not, we need to analyze the given information and the logical relationship between the statements.\n\nThe first statement is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This statement implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding.\n\nThe second statement is \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This statement simply states that Sue was at the wedding, without any logical connection to the first statement.\n\nTo deduce whether Mary was at the wedding or not, we need to consider both statements together. If the first statement is true, then Mary was at the wedding and Sue was also at the wedding. Therefore, we can deduce that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nHowever, if the first statement is false, then Mary was not at the wedding and Sue was not at the wedding either. In this case, the second statement does not provide any information about Mary's presence at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce whether Mary was at the wedding or not, as the information given is incomplete and does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No.",
