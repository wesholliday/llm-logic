            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo deduce 'The vampire was awake' from 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' and 'The mummy was awake', we need to use logical reasoning.\n\nFirst, we can deduce that 'The mummy was awake' from 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' and 'The mummy was awake'. This is because the first statement implies that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake. Therefore, if the mummy is awake, then the vampire must also be awake.\n\nSecond, we can deduce that 'The vampire was awake' from 'The mummy was awake'. This is because the mummy and the vampire are both awake, which means that the vampire must also be awake.\n\nTherefore, we can logically deduce 'The vampire was awake' from 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' and 'The mummy was awake'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
