The banana was yellow.\n\nTo deduce whether the apple was red or not, we need to analyze the given statements and their logical relationships.\n\nFirstly, we need to determine whether the given statements are mutually exclusive or not. In other words, are they contradictory or not?\n\nIf the given statements are mutually exclusive, then we cannot deduce anything about the apple's color from them.\n\nHowever, in this case, the given statements are not mutually exclusive. They are both true, and we can deduce that the apple was red.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
