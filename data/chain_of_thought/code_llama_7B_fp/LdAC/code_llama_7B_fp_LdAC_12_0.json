            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo deduce whether Joe went to the park based on the statements \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" and \"Lucy went to the zoo,\" we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy would also go to the zoo. This means that if Joe did go to the park, then Lucy would have also gone to the zoo.\n\nThe second statement \"Lucy went to the zoo\" simply states that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nNow, we can use the first statement to deduce whether Joe went to the park. If we assume that Lucy went to the zoo, then we can infer that Joe went to the park because the first statement implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy would have also gone to the zoo. Therefore, if Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe must have gone to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
