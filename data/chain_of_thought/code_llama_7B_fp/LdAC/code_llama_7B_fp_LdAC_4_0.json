The robot visited Jupiter.\n\nTo deduce whether the alien visited Mars, we need to use the given statements to form a logical argument. We can do this by using the following steps:\n\n1. Start with the premises:\n\t* If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n\t* The robot visited Jupiter.\n2. Draw the conclusion:\n\t* The alien visited Mars.\n\nTo do this, we need to use the first premise to infer that the robot visited Mars, since the first premise states that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. Therefore, we can conclude that the robot visited Mars, since the robot did visit Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
