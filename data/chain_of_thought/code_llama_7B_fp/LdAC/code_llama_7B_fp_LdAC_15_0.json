It does not necessarily mean that Sam took a plane, but rather that if he did, then Erin took a train.\n\nThe second statement is \"Erin took a train.\" This statement does not provide any information about Sam's mode of transportation.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce whether Sam took a plane or not based on the given information. The information provided is incomplete and does not allow us to make a definitive conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No.",
