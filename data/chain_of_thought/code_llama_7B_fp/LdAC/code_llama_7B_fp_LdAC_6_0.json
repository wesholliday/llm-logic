The statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" implies that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. This means that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nSince Bob did choose pasta, and the statement \"Bob chose pasta\" is true, it follows that Sue did not choose pizza. Therefore, we can logically deduce that Sue chose pizza.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
