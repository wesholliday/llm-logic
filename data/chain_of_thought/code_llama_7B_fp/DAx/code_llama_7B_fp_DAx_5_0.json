If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\n2. The zinger was not fraggled.\n\nTo infer the conclusion, we need to use the first premise to deduce the second premise. The first premise states that if the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled. This means that if the zinger was not fraggled, then it was not smoogled.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can infer is:\n\nThe zinger was not smoogled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
