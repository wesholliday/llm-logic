The sprocket was not cranked.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The sprocket was not daggled,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to determine whether the premises are consistent with each other. If the sprocket was not cranked, then it cannot have been daggled, regardless of whether it was cranked or not. Therefore, the premises are not consistent with each other, and we cannot infer the conclusion \"The sprocket was not daggled.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is no.",
