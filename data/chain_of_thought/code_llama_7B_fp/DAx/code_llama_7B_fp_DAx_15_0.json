            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer 'The dreb was not spended' from 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spended' together with 'The dreb was not vroombed', we need to use logical reasoning and the principles of deduction.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the meaning of the given statements. 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spended' means that if the dreb was vroombed (i.e., it was used for a purpose), then it was also spended (i.e., it was used up or consumed). 'The dreb was not vroombed' means that the dreb was not used for a purpose.\n\nNow, let's apply the principles of deduction to the given statements. If the dreb was not vroombed, then it was not spended. This is because if the dreb was not used for a purpose, then it was not used up or consumed. Therefore, if the dreb was not vroombed, then it was not spended.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The dreb was not spended' from 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spended' together with 'The dreb was not vroombed'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
