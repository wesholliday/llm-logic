The shank was not plooked.\n\nTo infer the conclusion, \"The shank was not nugged,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the conclusion that we want to draw. In this case, the conclusion is \"The shank was not nugged.\"\n\nNext, we need to identify the premises that support the conclusion. In this case, the premises are:\n\n1. If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\n2. The shank was not plooked.\n\nNow, we need to use the rules of inference to draw the conclusion. One rule of inference that we can use is Modus Tollens, which states that if a condition is necessary for an event, and the condition is false, then the event is necessarily false.\n\nIn this case, the condition is \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\" If this condition is false, then the event \"The shank was nugged\" is necessarily false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The shank was not nugged\" based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
