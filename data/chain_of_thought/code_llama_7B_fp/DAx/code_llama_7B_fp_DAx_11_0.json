The flug was not blummed.\n\nTo infer whether the flug was not zimmed, we need to analyze the given statements and their logical relationships.\n\nFirstly, we need to determine whether the first statement is a logical tautology or not. A logical tautology is a statement that is always true, regardless of the values of the variables. In this case, the first statement is not a logical tautology because it contains a conditional statement, which means that the statement is only true if the condition is met.\n\nSecondly, we need to determine whether the second statement is a logical contradiction or not. A logical contradiction is a statement that is always false, regardless of the values of the variables. In this case, the second statement is not a logical contradiction because it is a statement about the blummedness of the flug, which is not necessarily related to the zimmedness of the flug.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given statements together:\n\n1. If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\n2. The flug was not blummed.\n\nBased on the given statements, we can infer that the flug was not zimmed. This is because if the flug was blummed, then it would have been zimmed according to the first statement. However, since the flug was not blummed, it cannot have been zimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
