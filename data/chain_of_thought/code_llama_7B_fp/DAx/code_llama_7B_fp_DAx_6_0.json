The grommet was not sploffed.\n\nTo infer the conclusion, we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\n1. Premise 1: If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\n2. Premise 2: The grommet was not sploffed.\n\nInference: Therefore, the grommet did not plop the frink.\n\nReasoning:\n\n1. If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink. (Premise 1)\n2. The grommet was not sploffed. (Premise 2)\n\nWe can infer the conclusion by using the contrapositive of the first premise. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\". In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" is \"If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed\".\n\nSince we know that the grommet was not sploffed (Premise 2), we can infer that the grommet did not plop the frink (Contrapositive of Premise 1). Therefore, the answer is yes.",
