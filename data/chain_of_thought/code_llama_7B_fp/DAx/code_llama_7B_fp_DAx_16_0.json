            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The sneg did not sprot the frink\" from the premises \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\" and \"The sneg was not crampled,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the meaning of the premises. \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\" means that if the sneg was cramped, then it would have sprouted the frink. \"The sneg was not cramped\" means that the sneg was not cramped.\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of inference. We need to use the premises to infer the conclusion. We can do this by using the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the conclusion: The conclusion is \"The sneg did not sprot the frink.\"\n2. Identify the premises: The premises are \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\" and \"The sneg was not cramped.\"\n3. Apply the rules of inference: We need to use the premises to infer the conclusion. We can do this by using the following rules:\n\na. Modus ponens: If the premises are \"If P, then Q\" and \"P,\" then we can infer \"Q.\"\n\nb. Modus tollens: If the premises are \"If P, then Q\" and \"not Q,\" then we can infer \"not P.\"\n\nc. Hypothetical syllogism: If the premises are \"If P, then Q\" and \"If not P, then not Q,\" then we can infer \"Q.\"\n\nd. Contrary to hypothesis: If the premises are \"If P, then Q\" and \"not Q,\" then we can infer \"not P.\"\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of inference to the given premises:\n\n1. Modus ponens: If the sneg was cramped, then it would have sprouted the frink. (Premise 1)\n2. Modus tollens: If the sneg was not cramped, then it did not sprout the frink. (Premise 2)\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sneg did not sprout the frink.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
