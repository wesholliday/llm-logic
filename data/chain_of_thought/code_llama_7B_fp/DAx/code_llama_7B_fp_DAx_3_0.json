The premises are independent statements, and we can assume that they are both true.\n2. The conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises.\n\nTo determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises, we need to analyze the statements and their relationships.\n\n\"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" means that if the splat was transformed into a different form, then it would have quanked.\n\n\"The splat was not morphed\" means that the splat was not transformed into a different form.\n\nTherefore, if the splat was not morphed, then it did not quank.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
