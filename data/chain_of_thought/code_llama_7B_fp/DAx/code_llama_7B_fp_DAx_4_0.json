The premises are:\n\t* If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\n\t* The fribble was not snurgled.\n2. The conclusion we want to draw is:\n\t* The fribble did not crink.\n\nTo draw this conclusion, we need to use the first premise to infer that the fribble did not crink if it was snurgled. Since the fribble was not snurgled, we can infer that it did not crink.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
