This means that the wug was not flooped at the time the bimming occurred.\n\nNow, we can use the rules of inference to draw a conclusion. The rule of inference we need to use is called Modus Tollens, which states that if the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, then the consequent is also false. In this case, the antecedent of the conditional statement is \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint,\" and the consequent is \"The wug bimmed the zoint.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The wug did not bim the zoint\" because if the wug was flooped, then it would bim the zoint, but since the wug was not flooped, it did not bim the zoint.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
