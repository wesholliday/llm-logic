The first premise states that if the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled. This premise is true, as the wug was not sproinged, and therefore it was not garpled.\n\nThe second premise states that the wug was not sproinged. This premise is also true, as the wug was not sproinged.\n\nNow, we can use the rules of inference to draw a conclusion. The conclusion we want to draw is \"The wug was not garpled.\" To do this, we need to use the first premise to infer that the wug was not garpled.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The wug was not garpled\" can be inferred from the premises \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" and \"The wug was not sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
