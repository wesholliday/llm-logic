'If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled' means that if the flugel was blimmed, then it was also zargled. 'The flugel was not blimmed' means that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nNow, let's apply the principles of deduction. If the premise 'If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled' is true, and the premise 'The flugel was not blimmed' is also true, then we can infer that the conclusion 'The flugel was not zargled' is also true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes. We can infer 'The flugel was not zargled' from 'If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled' together with 'The flugel was not blimmed'.",
