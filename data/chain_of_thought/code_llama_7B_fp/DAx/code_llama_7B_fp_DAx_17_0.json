If the premise \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated\" is true, and the premise \"The flob was not skizzled\" is true, then we can infer that the conclusion \"The flob was not movated\" is also true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes. We can infer \"The flob was not movated\" from \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated\" together with \"The flob was not skizzled.\"",
