The premise \"The notebook might not be in the drawer\" is a possibility that is not necessarily true. If the notebook is not in the drawer, then it is not the case that it must be in the drawer. However, the conclusion \"It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer\" is a statement that is not necessarily true. It is possible that the notebook is not in the drawer, but it is also possible that it is in the drawer. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
