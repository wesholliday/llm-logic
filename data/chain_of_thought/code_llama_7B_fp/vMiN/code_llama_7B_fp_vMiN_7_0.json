The premise states that Alex might not have finished the race, which is a possibility, but it does not necessarily mean that Alex did not finish the race. The conclusion, on the other hand, states that it is not the case that Alex must have finished the race, which is a stronger statement than the premise. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
