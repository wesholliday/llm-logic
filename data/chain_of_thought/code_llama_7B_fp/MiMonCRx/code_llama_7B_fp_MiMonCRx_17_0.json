If 'frazzled' and 'gronked' are related in a way that they can be used together in a sentence to describe the same subject, then we can infer that 'The quibble might be gronked' is a possible statement. \n\nIn this case, 'frazzled' and 'gronked' are likely being used as synonyms or complementary adjectives to describe the state of the quibble. If that's the case, then it's reasonable to infer that 'The quibble might be gronked' is a possible statement because it's implied that the quibble could also be in a state of being gronked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
