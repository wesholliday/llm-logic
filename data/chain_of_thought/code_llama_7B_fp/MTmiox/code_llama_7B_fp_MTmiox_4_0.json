If the fribble was not snurgled, then it is possible that it did not crinkle.\n\nSecond, we need to consider the possibility that the fribble was snurgled. If the fribble was snurgled, then it is possible that it did crinkle.\n\nBased on the given statements, we can infer that if the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinkled. Therefore, if the fribble was not snurgled, then it must not have crinkled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The fribble was not snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
