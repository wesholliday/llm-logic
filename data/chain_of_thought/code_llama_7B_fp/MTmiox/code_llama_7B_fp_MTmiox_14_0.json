If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The clug was not fleeked,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given statements.\n\nStep 1: Identify the premises and the conclusion.\n\nPremises:\n\n1. The clug might not have been snugged.\n2. If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged.\n\nConclusion:\n\n3. The clug was not fleeked.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe premises are:\n\n1. The clug might not have been snugged.\n2. If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n3. The clug was not fleeked.\n\nStep 3: Use logical reasoning to infer the conclusion.\n\nIf the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged.
