This is indicated by the first statement.\n\nSecond, we need to consider the possibility that the flob was skizzled. This is indicated by the second statement.\n\nIf the flob was skizzled, then it must have moved, according to the second statement.\n\nTherefore, if the flob was skizzled, it must have moved.\n\nHowever, if the flob might not have moved, then it cannot have been skizzled, as the second statement implies that the flob must have moved if it was skizzled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The flob was not skizzled\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
