Therefore, we can eliminate the possibility of \"The whiffle was shanked\" by assuming that it is not shanked.\n\nStep 2: Infer \"The whiffle was not shanked\"\n\nSince we have eliminated the possibility of \"The whiffle was shanked,\" we can infer that \"The whiffle was not shanked.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
