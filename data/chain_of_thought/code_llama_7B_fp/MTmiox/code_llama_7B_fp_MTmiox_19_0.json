If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The smonk was not vreebled,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to determine whether the premises are valid.\n\n1. The smonk might not have plagged.\nThis premise is valid because it is possible for the smonk to have not plagged, even if it was vreebled.\n2. If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged.\nThis premise is valid because if the smonk was vreebled, then it must have plagged, according to the definition of vreebled.\n\nNow, we can use the rules of inference to draw the conclusion.\n\n1. The smonk might not have plagged.\n2. If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged.\n\nUsing the rule of exclusion, we can infer that \"The smonk was not vreebled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
