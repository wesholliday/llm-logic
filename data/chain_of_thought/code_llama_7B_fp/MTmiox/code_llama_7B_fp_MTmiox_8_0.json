If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The sprocket was not cranked,\" we need to consider the possible interpretations of the given premises and the relationship between them.\n\n1. The first premise suggests that the sprocket might not have been daggled, which means it could have been left uncranked.\n2. The second premise states that if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled. This premise implies that if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible combinations of these premises:\n\n* If the sprocket was not daggled, then it was not cranked.\n* If the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled.\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer that if the sprocket was not daggled, then it was not cranked. This conclusion is supported by the first premise, which suggests that the sprocket might not have been daggled.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
