If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The wug was not sproinged,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given statements.\n\nFirst, we need to consider the possibility that the wug might not have been garpled. This is indicated by the first statement.\n\nSecond, we need to consider the possibility that the wug was sproinged. If this is the case, then it must have been garpled, according to the second statement.\n\nNow, we can infer that the wug was not sproinged, since it was not garpled. This is the conclusion we want to draw.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
