This means that there is a possibility that the sneg did not sprot the frink.\n\nSecond, we can infer that \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink\" is true. This means that if the sneg was crampled, then it must have sproted the frink.\n\nNow, we can use these two statements to infer that \"The sneg was not crampled\" is true. This is because if the sneg was not crampled, then it must have sproted the frink, which is the opposite of what we inferred from the first statement. Therefore, we can conclude that \"The sneg was not crampled\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
