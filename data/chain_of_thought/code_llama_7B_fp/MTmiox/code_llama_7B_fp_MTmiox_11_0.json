If the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed, according to the second statement. Therefore, we can conclude that the flug was not blummed.\n\nSecond, we can infer that the flug was not zimmed by considering the first statement. If the flug was not zimmed, then it might not have been zimmed, according to the first statement. Therefore, we can conclude that the flug was not zimmed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flug was not blummed and was not zimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
