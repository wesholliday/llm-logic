The sentence is a play on words, with \"crink\" and \"plook\" being homophones (words that sound the same but have different meanings).\n\nTo answer your question, we can infer that \"If we crink the snoogle and a wug zites, then we'll plook a nurp\" is also a riddle, and the answer to the riddle is \"yes.\" This is because the word \"wug\" is a homophone of \"look,\" and the sentence is still a valid riddle even with the additional word \"and a wug zites.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
