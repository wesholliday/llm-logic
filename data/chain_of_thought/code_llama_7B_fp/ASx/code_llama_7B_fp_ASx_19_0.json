However, the statement does not explicitly state that the zool is zapped, so it is not clear whether the conclusion would still hold if the zool is zapped.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first statement without additional information. The second statement requires additional information about the zool, and it is not clear whether the zool is zapped or not.\n\nAnswer: No.",
