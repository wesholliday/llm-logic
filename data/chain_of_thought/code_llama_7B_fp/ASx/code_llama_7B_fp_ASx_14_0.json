It means that if the frizzle is dinked, then the zarp will splunk.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"If the frizzle is dinked and the sklonk is grooped, then the zarp will splunk.\" This statement is a more specific version of the first statement. It adds an additional condition to the first statement, which is that the sklonk must also be grooped.\n\nWe can infer that if the frizzle is dinked and the sklonk is grooped, then the zarp will splunk. This is because the first statement \"If the frizzle is dinked, then the zarp will splunk\" is a logical implication, and adding the additional condition of the sklonk being grooped does not change the logical implication.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
