This means that the grommet must be plopped.\n\nSecond, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed by the second statement. This means that either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped. Since we have already established that the grommet is plopped, we can conclude that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
