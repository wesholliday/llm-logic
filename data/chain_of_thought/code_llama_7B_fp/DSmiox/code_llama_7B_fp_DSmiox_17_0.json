If the flob is movated, then it is not skizzled, so the second statement does not apply.\n\nSecond, we can infer that the flob is skizzled based on the second statement. If the flob is not movated, then it must be skizzled, as stated in the second statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The flob is skizzled\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
