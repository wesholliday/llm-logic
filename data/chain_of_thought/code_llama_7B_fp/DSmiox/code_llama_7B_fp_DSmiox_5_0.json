This means that the zinger must be smoogled.\n\nSecond, we can infer that the zinger is fraggled by the second statement. This is because the second statement states that either the zinger is fraggled or it must be smoogled. Since the zinger is smoogled, it must be fraggled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The zinger is fraggled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
