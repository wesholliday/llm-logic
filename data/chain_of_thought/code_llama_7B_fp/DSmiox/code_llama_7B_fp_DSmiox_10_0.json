This means that the wug must be garpled.\n\nSecond, we can infer that the wug is sproinged by the second statement. This is because the second statement states that either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled. Since the wug is garpled, it must be sproinged.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
