This means that the wug could be in a state where it is not bimmed, which could be either flooped or not flooped.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that either the wug is flooped or it must be bimmed. This means that if the wug is not flooped, it must be bimmed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the wug is not flooped, it must be bimmed. This means that if the wug is not flooped, it is bimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
