We are also given that the cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\n\nTo infer that the cookies are in the jar, we need to consider the information provided and the possible outcomes of each possibility. If the cookies are in the jar, then they are not hidden in the pantry. If the cookies are hidden in the pantry, then they are not in the jar.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar, since the cookies are not hidden in the pantry.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
