We are not told whether the notebook is sitting on the nightstand, so we cannot infer that it is in the drawer. However, we are told that the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand, which means that it must be in the drawer. Therefore, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
