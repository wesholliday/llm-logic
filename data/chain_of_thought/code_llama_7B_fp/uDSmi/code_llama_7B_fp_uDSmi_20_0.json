The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can conclude that if the sunglasses are not in her bag, then they must be perched on her head.\n\nFrom the second statement, we can conclude that the sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the sunglasses are in her bag. If the sunglasses are in her bag, then they cannot be perched on her head, as they are not in her possession. Therefore, the second statement does not apply.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the sunglasses are not in her bag, then they must be perched on her head.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
