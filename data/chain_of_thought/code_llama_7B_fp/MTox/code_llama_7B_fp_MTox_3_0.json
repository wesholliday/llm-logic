If the splat was not morphed, then it did not have the property of quanking, and therefore, the statement \"The splat did not quank\" would be true. On the other hand, if the splat was morphed, then it would have the property of quanking, and therefore, the statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" would be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the splat was not morphed based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
