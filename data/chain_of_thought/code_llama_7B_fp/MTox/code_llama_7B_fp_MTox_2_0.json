The premise \"The wug did not bim the zoint\" states that the wug did not perform the action of bimming the zoint.\n2. The premise \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint\" states that if the wug was flooped, then it would perform the action of bimming the zoint.\n3. The conclusion \"The wug was not flooped\" states that the wug was not flooped.\n\nTo infer the conclusion from the premises, we need to use the rule of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time.\n\nIf the wug was flooped, then it would have performed the action of bimming the zoint, which contradicts the premise \"The wug did not bim the zoint\". Therefore, we can infer that the wug was not flooped.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
