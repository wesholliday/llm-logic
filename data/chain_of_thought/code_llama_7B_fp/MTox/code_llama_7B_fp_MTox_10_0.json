If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The wug was not sproinged,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the wug was garpled by using the contrapositive of the second premise. If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled, which means that the wug was not garpled. Therefore, we can conclude that the wug was not sproinged.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
