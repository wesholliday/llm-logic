If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The flugel was not blimmed,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the flugel was zargled by using the first premise. If the flugel was not zargled, then it cannot be blimmed, as the second premise states. Therefore, we can conclude that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
