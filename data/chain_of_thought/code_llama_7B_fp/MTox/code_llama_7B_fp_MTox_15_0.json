If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spent.\n2. If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spent.\n\nFrom these combinations, we can infer that if the dreb was not vroombed, then it was not spent. This means that the first statement is true, and the second statement is false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The dreb was not vroombed\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
