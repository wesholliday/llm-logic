The first premise states that the fribble did not crink, and the second premise states that if the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked. This relationship is represented by the conditional statement \"If A, then B.\"\n\nNext, we need to determine whether the conclusion \"The fribble was not snurgled\" follows logically from the premises. To do this, we need to apply the rules of inference.\n\nOne possible rule of inference that could be applied is the contrapositive rule, which states that if \"If A, then B,\" then \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the conclusion \"The fribble was not snurgled\" follows logically from the premises \"The fribble did not crink\" and \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\" because if the fribble did not crink, then it must not have been snurgled, and if the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes, we can infer the conclusion \"The fribble was not snurgled\" from the premises \"The fribble did not crink\" and \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
