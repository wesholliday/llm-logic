If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The clug was not fleeked,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nStep 1: We can infer that the clug was not snugged, because the premise \"The clug did not snugged\" is true.\n\nStep 2: If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged. This premise is true if the clug was not fleeked.\n\nStep 3: Therefore, we can infer that the clug was not fleeked, because if the clug was fleeked, then the clug would have snugged, but it did not.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
