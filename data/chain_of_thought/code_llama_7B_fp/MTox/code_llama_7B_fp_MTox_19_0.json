If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The smonk was not vreebled,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the conclusion that we want to draw from the given premises. In this case, the conclusion is \"The smonk was not vreebled.\"\n\nNext, we need to determine whether the given premises are sufficient to support the conclusion. In this case, the premises are not sufficient to support the conclusion.\n\nThe first premise states that the smonk did not plagged, which means that the smonk did not engage in plagiarism. However, the second premise states that if the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged. This premise is not necessarily true, as it is based on a hypothetical scenario.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the conclusion \"The smonk was not vreebled\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
