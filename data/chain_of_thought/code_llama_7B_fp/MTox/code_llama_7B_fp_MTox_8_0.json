If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The sprocket was not cranked,\" we need to use logical reasoning.\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the contradictory premise\n\nThe first premise states that the sprocket was not daggled. If the sprocket was daggled, then it would be cranked. Therefore, if the sprocket was daggled, then it was cranked.\n\nStep 2: Infer the conclusion\n\nFrom the second premise, we know that if the sprocket was cranked, then it was daggled. Since the sprocket was not daggled, it cannot have been cranked. Therefore, we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
