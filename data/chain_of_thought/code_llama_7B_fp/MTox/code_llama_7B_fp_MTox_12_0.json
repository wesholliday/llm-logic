This means that the smip was not the one who luped the zoint.\n\nStep 2: We also know that if the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint. This means that if the smip was shripped, then the smip would have luped the zoint.\n\nStep 3: We can infer that the smip was not shripped because the smip did not lup the zoint. This means that the smip was not shripped, and therefore, the smip did not lupped the zoint.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
