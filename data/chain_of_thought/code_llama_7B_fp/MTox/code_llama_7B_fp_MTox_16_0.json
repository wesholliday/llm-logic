This means that the sneg did not move the frink.\n\nStep 2: We also know that if the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink. This means that if the sneg was compressed, it would move the frink.\n\nStep 3: We can infer that the sneg was not crampled because it did not move the frink. This means that the sneg was not compressed, and therefore it did not move the frink.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
