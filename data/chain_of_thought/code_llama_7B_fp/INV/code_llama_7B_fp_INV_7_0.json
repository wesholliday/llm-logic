The statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is a correct inference, but the statement \"If Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race\" is not a correct inference.\n\nThe reason for this is that the first statement is based on the assumption that Alex finished the race, which is a given. However, the second statement is based on the assumption that Alex did not finish the race, which is not a given. Therefore, the second statement is not a correct inference.\n\nAnswer: No.",
