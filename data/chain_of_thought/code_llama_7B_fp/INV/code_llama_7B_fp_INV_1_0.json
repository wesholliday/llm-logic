            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis is a classic example of a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement that implies a causal relationship between Mary's presence at the wedding and Sue's presence at the wedding. However, this statement does not necessarily imply that the absence of Mary at the wedding would necessarily lead to the absence of Sue at the wedding.\n\nIn other words, the statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" does not necessarily imply that \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\" This is because the presence of Mary at the wedding does not necessarily guarantee the presence of Sue at the wedding, and the absence of Mary at the wedding does not necessarily guarantee the absence of Sue at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\" from \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
