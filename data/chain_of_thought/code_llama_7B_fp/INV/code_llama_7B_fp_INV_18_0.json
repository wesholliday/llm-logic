            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" implies that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. This is because the statement is using a conditional statement, which means that the conclusion (the truck being metal) is only true if the premise (the doll being plastic) is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the doll is not plastic, then the truck is not metal. This is because if the premise of the conditional statement is false (i.e., the doll is not plastic), then the conclusion cannot be true (i.e., the truck is not metal).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
