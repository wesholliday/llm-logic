            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis is a classic logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement that implies a causal relationship between the color of the car and the color of the truck. However, the statement does not necessarily imply that the opposite of the condition is true.\n\nFor example, if the car was red and the truck was blue, then it is not necessarily true that the car was not red and the truck was not blue. There could be other factors at play that caused the car and truck to be a certain color.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue\" based on the statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\"",
