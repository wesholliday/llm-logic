            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis is a classic example of a logical deduction problem. The given statement is:\n\nIf Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nWe are asked to infer whether we can infer the following statement:\n\nIf Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to analyze the given statement and the inference we are asked to make.\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement, which means that it has a condition (Lisa bought the red shirt) and a consequence (Mark bought the blue shirt). The condition is necessary for the consequence to occur.\n\nThe inference we are asked to make is also a conditional statement, which means that it has a condition (Lisa did not buy the red shirt) and a consequence (Mark did not buy the blue shirt). The condition is necessary for the consequence to occur.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements.\n\nIf the first statement is true, then the second statement must also be true. This is because the condition in the first statement (Lisa bought the red shirt) is necessary for the consequence (Mark bought the blue shirt) to occur. Therefore, if the first statement is true, then the second statement must also be true.\n\nHowever, if the first statement is false, then the second statement may or may not be true. This is because the condition in the first statement is not necessary for the consequence (Mark bought the blue shirt) to occur. Therefore, if the first statement is false, then the second statement may or may not be true.\n\nIn conclusion, we can infer the second statement from the first statement if the first statement is true. However, if the first statement is false, then we cannot infer the second statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
