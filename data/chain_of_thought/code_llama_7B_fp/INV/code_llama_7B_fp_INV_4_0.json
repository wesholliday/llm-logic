However, it does not necessarily mean that the alien not visiting Mars and the robot not visiting Jupiter are also related.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter\" based solely on the first statement. We would need additional information or evidence to support this inference.\n\nAnswer: No.",
