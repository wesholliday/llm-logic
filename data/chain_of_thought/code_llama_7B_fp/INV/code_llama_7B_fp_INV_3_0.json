            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is a conditional statement that implies a relationship between the two conditions. The first condition is that the book was written by James, and the second condition is that the book is a mystery novel. The statement is saying that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel\". This statement is also a conditional statement, but it is the opposite of the first statement. It is saying that if the book was not written by James, then it cannot be a mystery novel.\n\nThe two statements are related, but they are not the same. The first statement is saying that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel, while the second statement is saying that if the book was not written by James, then it cannot be a mystery novel.\n\nSo, when we ask \"Can we infer 'If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel' from 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel'?\", we are asking if the two statements are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that. The two statements are not logically equivalent. The first statement is saying that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel, while the second statement is saying that if the book was not written by James, then it cannot be a mystery novel. These statements are not the same, and they do not logically imply each other.",
