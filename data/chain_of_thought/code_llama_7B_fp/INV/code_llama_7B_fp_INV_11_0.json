However, it does not necessarily mean that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nFor example, if the cake was chocolate and the muffins were blueberry, then the statement would be true. But if the cake was not chocolate and the muffins were blueberry, then the statement would still be true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nAnswer: No.",
