However, it does not necessarily mean that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\n\nFor example, suppose Jeff did not play basketball because he was injured, but Amy still played tennis. In this case, the statement \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis\" would not be true, even though the original statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis\" based solely on the fact that \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\".",
