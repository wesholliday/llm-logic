This means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding, and vice versa.\n\nThe statement \"Sue was at the wedding\" is true, which means that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, if we assume that \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is true and \"Sue was at the wedding\" is true, it does not necessarily follow that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true.\n\nAnswer: No.",
