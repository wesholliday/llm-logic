The premises are mutually exclusive, meaning that if the first premise is true, the second premise cannot also be true.\n2. The conclusion is the inverse of the first premise, meaning that if the first premise is true, the conclusion is false, and if the conclusion is true, the first premise is false.\n\nIn this case, the premises are mutually exclusive, and the conclusion is the inverse of the first premise. Therefore, it necessarily follows that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
