This means that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim, and if the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton.\n\nThe statement \"The pants were denim\" is also true. This means that the pants were denim, regardless of whether the shirt was cotton or not.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that \"The shirt was cotton\" is true. The statement \"The shirt was cotton\" is not necessarily implied by the previous two statements.\n\nAnswer: No.",
