The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Sue chose pizza) is true, then the consequent (Bob must have chosen pasta) must also be true. However, the second premise is a negative statement, which means that it is not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta. This means that the conditional statement in the first premise is not necessarily true, and therefore the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
