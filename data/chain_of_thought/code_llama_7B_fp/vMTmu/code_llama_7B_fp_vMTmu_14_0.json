The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the \"if\") is true and the consequent (the part after the \"if\") is true. In this case, the antecedent is \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\" This statement is not necessarily true, as there may be other reasons why the wolf was not in the den.\n\nThe second premise is \"It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den.\" This statement is also not necessarily true, as there may be other reasons why the wolf was not in the den.\n\nThe conclusion is \"The bear was not in the cave.\" This conclusion is logically valid if the first premise is true and the second premise is false. However, if the first premise is false, then the conclusion does not follow.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid.",
