The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (in this case, \"the book was written by James\") is true, then the consequent (in this case, \"the book must be a mystery novel\") must also be true. However, the second premise is a negative statement, which means that the consequent (in this case, \"the book must be a mystery novel\") is not necessarily true. Therefore, the argument is not valid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
