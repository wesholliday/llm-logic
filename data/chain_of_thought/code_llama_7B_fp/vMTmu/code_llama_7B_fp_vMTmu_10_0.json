The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (in this case, \"the dog was inside\") is true, then the consequent (in this case, \"the cat must have been outside\") must also be true. However, the second premise is a negative statement, which means that it is not the case that the cat must have been outside. This means that the conditional statement in the first premise is not necessarily true, and therefore the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
