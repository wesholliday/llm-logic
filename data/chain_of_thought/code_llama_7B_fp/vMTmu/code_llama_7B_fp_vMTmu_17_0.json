The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the consequent (Kate must have eaten salad) must also be true. However, the second premise is a negative statement, which states that it is not the case that Kate must have eaten salad. This means that the conditional statement in the first premise is not necessarily true, and the conclusion does not logically follow.\n\nAnswer: No.",
