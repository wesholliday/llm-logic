The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter. However, the second premise is a negative statement, which states that it is not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter. This means that the second premise is not a necessary condition for the first premise to be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the first premise is not necessarily true based on the second premise. The conclusion, that the alien did not visit Mars, is not necessarily true either.\n\nAnswer: No.",
