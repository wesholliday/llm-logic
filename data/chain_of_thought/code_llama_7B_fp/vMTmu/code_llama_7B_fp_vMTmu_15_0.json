The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Sam took a plane) is true, then the consequent (Erin must have taken a train) must also be true. However, the second premise is a negative statement, which means that it is not the case that Erin must have taken a train. This means that the conditional statement in the first premise is not necessarily true, and therefore the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
