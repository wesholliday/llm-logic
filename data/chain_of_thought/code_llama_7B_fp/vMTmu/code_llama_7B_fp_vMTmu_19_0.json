The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Tom watched football) is true, then the consequent (Jen must have watched basketball) must also be true. However, the second premise is a negative statement, which means that it is not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. This means that the conditional statement in the first premise is not necessarily true, and therefore the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
