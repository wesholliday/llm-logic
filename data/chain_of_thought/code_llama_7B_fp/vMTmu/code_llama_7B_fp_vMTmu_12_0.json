The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Joe going to the park) is true, then the consequent (Lucy going to the zoo) must also be true. However, the second premise is a negative statement, which states that it is not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This means that the conditional statement in the first premise is not necessarily true, and the conclusion does not logically follow.\n\nAnswer: No.",
