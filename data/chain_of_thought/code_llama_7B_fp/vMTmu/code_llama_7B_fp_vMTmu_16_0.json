The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that it is only true if the condition in the if-clause is true. In this case, the condition is that the shirt was cotton. The second premise is a negative statement, which means that it is true if the condition in the if-clause is false. In this case, the condition is that the pants must have been denim.\n\nThe conclusion is that the shirt was not cotton. However, the argument is not valid because the first premise is not true. If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants could have been anything, including denim. Therefore, the second premise is not a valid reason to reject the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No.",
