This means that the speaker does not know for certain whether the pen is in their bag or not.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the pen must be in the speaker's bag. This is because the speaker does not know for certain whether the pen is in their bag or not, so it is not necessarily the case that the pen is in their bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
