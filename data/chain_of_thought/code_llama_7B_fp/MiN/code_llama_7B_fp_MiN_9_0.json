            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" from \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt,\" we need to consider the meaning of \"might\" and \"must.\"\n\n\"Might\" is a modal verb that expresses possibility or uncertainty. It indicates that the action described is not certain or guaranteed to happen. In this case, \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\" means that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, but it is not certain that she did not buy it.\n\n\"Must\" is a modal verb that expresses necessity or obligation. It indicates that the action described is necessary or required to happen. In this case, \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" means that it is not necessary or required that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" from \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\" because \"might\" implies possibility or uncertainty, while \"must\" implies necessity or obligation.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
