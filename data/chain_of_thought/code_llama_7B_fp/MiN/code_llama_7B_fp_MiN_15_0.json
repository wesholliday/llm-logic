This possibility is not necessarily the same as the statement \"It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet.\"\n\nThe first statement is a statement of possibility, while the second statement is a statement of necessity. The first statement is saying that it is possible that the shoes are not in the closet, while the second statement is saying that it is not the case that the shoes must be in the closet.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that it is possible that the shoes are not in the closet, but it is not necessarily the case that the shoes must be in the closet.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
