In other words, it is possible that the book was written by someone else.\n\nThe logical relationship between the two statements is that the first statement implies the second statement. If it is possible that the book was not written by James, then it is not the case that the book must have been written by James.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the second statement from the first statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
