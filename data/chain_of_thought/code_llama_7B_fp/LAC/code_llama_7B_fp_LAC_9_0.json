If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n2. Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nThe conclusion we want to draw is:\n\n3. Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nTo draw this conclusion, we need to use the first given information to infer that Mark bought the blue shirt. We can do this by using the conditional statement \"If A, then B.\" In this case, A is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and B is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nSo, if we assume that Lisa bought the red shirt, then we can infer that Mark bought the blue shirt. This means that Mark bought the blue shirt, and we also know that Mark bought the blue shirt. Therefore, we can logically infer that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
