            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the premises and the conclusion. The premises are:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n2. Sue was at the wedding.\n\nThe conclusion is: Mary was at the wedding.\n\nTo logically infer the conclusion from the premises, we need to use the rules of inference. One of the rules of inference is Modus Ponens, which states that if a conditional statement is true, and the antecedent of the conditional statement is true, then the consequent of the conditional statement is true.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" The antecedent of this statement is \"Mary was at the wedding.\" The consequent of this statement is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nSince the antecedent is true (Mary was at the wedding), and the conditional statement is true (if the antecedent is true, then the consequent is true), we can logically infer that the consequent is also true (Sue was at the wedding).\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
