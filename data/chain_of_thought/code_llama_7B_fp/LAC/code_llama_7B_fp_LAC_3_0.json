            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The book was written by James\" from the premises \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" and \"The book is a mystery novel,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the meaning of the premises. \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" means that if the book was written by James, then it is true that the book is a mystery novel. This is a conditional statement, which means that the conclusion follows from the premise if the premise is true.\n\nSecond, we need to understand the meaning of the conclusion. \"The book was written by James\" means that the book was written by James, regardless of whether it is a mystery novel or not.\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of inference to the premises and the conclusion. We can use the rule of conditional proof to infer the conclusion from the premise. The rule of conditional proof states that if a conditional statement is true, then the conclusion follows from the premise.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" If this statement is true, then the conclusion \"The book was written by James\" follows from the premise.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer the conclusion \"The book was written by James\" from the premises \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" and \"The book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
