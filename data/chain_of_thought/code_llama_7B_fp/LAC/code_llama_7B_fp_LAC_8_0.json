'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' means that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would also be awake. 'The mummy was awake' means that the mummy was indeed awake.\n\nNow, let's apply the principle of modus ponens, which states that if a conditional statement is true, and the antecedent of the conditional statement is true, then the consequent of the conditional statement is also true. In this case, the conditional statement is 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake', and the antecedent is 'The vampire was awake'. Therefore, we can infer that the mummy was awake, and therefore the vampire was also awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
