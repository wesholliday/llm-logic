Bob chose pasta.\n\nTo determine whether we can logically infer that Sue chose pizza, we need to follow the rules of logical deduction.\n\nFirst, we need to determine whether the premises are true. The first premise states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. This premise is true if and only if Sue chose pizza and Bob chose pasta.\n\nThe second premise states that Bob chose pasta. This premise is true.\n\nNow, we need to apply the rules of logical deduction to determine whether we can logically infer that Sue chose pizza.\n\nThe rule of conditional syllogism states that if the premises are true, and the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises, then we can logically infer the conclusion.\n\nIn this case, the conclusion is that Sue chose pizza.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer that Sue chose pizza.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
