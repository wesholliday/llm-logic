It does not necessarily mean that Sam took a plane.\n\nThe second statement is \"Erin took a train.\" This statement does not provide any information about Sam's mode of transportation.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that Sam took a plane based on the given information. The statements do not contain enough information to make a logical inference.\n\nAnswer: No.",
