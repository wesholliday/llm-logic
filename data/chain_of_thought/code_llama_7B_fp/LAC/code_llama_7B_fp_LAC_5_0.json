If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n2. Amy played tennis.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n3. Jeff played basketball.\n\nTo infer the conclusion from the premises, we need to use logical reasoning. The first premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. This means that if Jeff did play basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\n\nThe second premise states that Amy played tennis. This means that Amy did play tennis.\n\nNow, we need to use the first premise to infer the conclusion. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. Therefore, if we assume that Jeff did play basketball, we can infer that Amy must have played tennis.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes, we can logically infer that Jeff played basketball from the given premises.",
