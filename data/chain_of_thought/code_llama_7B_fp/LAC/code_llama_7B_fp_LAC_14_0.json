The wolf was in the den.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The bear was in the cave,\" we need to use logical reasoning to connect the premises.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the meaning of the given premises. The first premise states that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. This means that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den, but it does not necessarily mean that the bear was in the cave.\n\nThe second premise states that the wolf was in the den. This means that the wolf was in the den, but it does not necessarily mean that the bear was in the cave.\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of logical reasoning to connect the premises. We need to use the first premise to infer the conclusion.\n\nIf the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n\nTherefore, if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n\nSo, we can infer that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
