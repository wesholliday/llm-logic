If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The griffin was not in the forest,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the unicorn was in the forest by using the first premise. If the unicorn was in the forest, then the first premise would be false, which means that the unicorn must not have been in the forest.\n\nSecond, we can eliminate the possibility that the griffin was not in the forest by using the second premise. If the griffin was not in the forest, then the second premise would be false, which means that the griffin must have been in the forest.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
