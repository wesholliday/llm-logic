If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The vampire was not awake,\" we need to use logical reasoning to connect the premises.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the mummy was awake by using the first premise. If the mummy was awake, then it would be the case that the mummy must have been awake, which contradicts the first premise. Therefore, we can conclude that the mummy was not awake.\n\nSecond, we can use the second premise to infer that the vampire was not awake. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy would have been awake, which we have already ruled out. Therefore, we can conclude that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
