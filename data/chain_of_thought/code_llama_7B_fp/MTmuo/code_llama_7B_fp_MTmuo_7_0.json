If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\n\nTo infer \"Alex did not finish the race,\" we need to use the conditional statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race\" and the negation of the first premise \"It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race.\"\n\nThe negation of the first premise is \"Chris must have finished the race.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"Alex did not finish the race\" by using the conditional statement and the negation of the first premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
