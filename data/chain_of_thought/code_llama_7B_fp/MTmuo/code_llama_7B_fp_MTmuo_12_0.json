If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nTo infer whether Joe did not go to the park, we need to consider the possible truth values of the premises and the conclusion.\n\nIf the first premise is true, then it means that Lucy did not go to the zoo. In this case, the second premise does not entail that Joe went to the park, because the second premise only entails that Lucy went to the zoo if Joe went to the park. Therefore, we cannot infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nOn the other hand, if the first premise is false, then it means that Lucy did go to the zoo. In this case, the second premise does entail that Joe went to the park, because the second premise only entails that Lucy went to the zoo if Joe went to the park. Therefore, we can infer that Joe did go to the park.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no, we cannot infer that Joe did not go to the park.",
