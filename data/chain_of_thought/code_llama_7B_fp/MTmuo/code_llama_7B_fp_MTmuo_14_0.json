If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The bear was not in the cave,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the wolf was in the den by using the first premise. If the wolf was in the den, then it would be the case that the wolf must have been in the den, which is not the case. Therefore, we can conclude that the wolf was not in the den.\n\nSecond, we can use the second premise to infer that the bear was not in the cave. If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den, which we have already determined was not the case. Therefore, we can conclude that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
