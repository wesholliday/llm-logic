If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\n\nTo infer 'The alien did not visit Mars', we need to use logical reasoning to deduce a conclusion from the given premises.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the robot visited Jupiter by using the first premise. If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then it is not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter.\n\nNext, we can use the second premise to deduce that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter. This means that if the alien did visit Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars, because if the alien did visit Mars, then the robot would have visited Jupiter, which we have already ruled out.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
