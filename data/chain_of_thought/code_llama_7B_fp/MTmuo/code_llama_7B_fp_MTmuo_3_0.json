This means that the book is not necessarily a mystery novel, and we can assume that it is not.\n\nSecond, we can infer that the book was written by James by the second premise. This means that the book is written by James, and we can assume that it is.\n\nNow, we can use logical reasoning to deduce the conclusion that the book was not written by James. If the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. However, we have already established that the book is not necessarily a mystery novel, so it cannot be a mystery novel. Therefore, we can conclude that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
