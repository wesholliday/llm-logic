If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\n\nTo infer whether Jeff did not play basketball, we need to consider the relationship between the premises. The first premise states that it is not the case that Amy must have played tennis, which means that Amy did not play tennis. The second premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. Since Jeff did not play basketball, the conclusion that Amy did not play tennis follows logically.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes.",
