If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The dog was not inside,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the cat was outside by using the first premise. If the cat was outside, then the first premise would be false, which means that the cat must have been inside.\n\nSecond, we can use the second premise to infer that the dog was inside if the cat was outside. If the cat was outside, then the second premise would be true, which means that the dog must have been inside.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
