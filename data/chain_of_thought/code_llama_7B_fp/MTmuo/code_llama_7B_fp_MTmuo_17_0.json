The premises state that Kate must have eaten salad, and that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad. The conclusion states that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nTo infer that Ben did not eat pasta, we can use the following reasoning:\n\n1. If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\n2. Ben did not eat pasta.\n3. Therefore, Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nThis reasoning is valid because the premises are logically consistent with the conclusion. If Ben ate pasta, then it is necessary that Kate must have eaten salad. However, if Ben did not eat pasta, then it is not necessary that Kate must have eaten salad. Therefore, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
