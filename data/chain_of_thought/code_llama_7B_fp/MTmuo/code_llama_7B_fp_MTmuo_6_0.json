If Bob must have chosen pasta, then it is not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta. Therefore, we can conclude that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nNext, we can use the second premise to infer that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta because of the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
