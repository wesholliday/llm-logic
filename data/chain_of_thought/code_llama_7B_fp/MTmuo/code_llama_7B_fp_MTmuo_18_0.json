If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The doll was not plastic,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the truck was metal by using the first premise. If the truck was not metal, then it must have been plastic, which contradicts the second premise. Therefore, we can conclude that the truck was plastic.\n\nSecond, we can infer that the doll was not plastic by using the second premise. If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal, which we have already established to be false. Therefore, we can conclude that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
