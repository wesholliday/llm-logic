The original statement is 'The zump must be at quimble bimboozle and in the gronk gronk'. The word 'and' is a conjunction that indicates a connection between two independent clauses. In this case, it suggests that the conditions 'at quimble bimboozle' and 'in the gronk gronk' are both necessary for the zump to be in the specified state. Therefore, we can infer that the zump must be in the gronk gronk, as it is one of the conditions stated.\n\nAnswer: yes"
