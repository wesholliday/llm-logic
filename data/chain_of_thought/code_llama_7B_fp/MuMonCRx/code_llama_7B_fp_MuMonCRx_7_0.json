The words \"frazzle\", \"quazzle\", \"gribble\", \"quimble\", and \"quorple\" seem to be nonsense words, but we can try to identify any possible connections between them. However, without any clear grammatical structure or logical connection, it's challenging to make a definitive inference. The statement appears to be a playful example of linguistic nonsense, rather than a meaningful sentence.\n\nAnswer: no"
