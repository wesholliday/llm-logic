If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\n\nTo infer \"The splat was morphed,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the meaning of the given premises. \"The splat quanked\" means that the splat was quanked, and \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" means that if the splat was morphed, then it would quank.\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of inference to the given premises. We can use the conditional statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" to infer \"The splat was morphed.\" This is because the conditional statement implies that if the splat was morphed, then it would quank. Therefore, if the splat quanked, then it must have been morphed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The splat was morphed\" based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
