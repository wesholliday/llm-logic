If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The fribble was snurgled,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the relationship between the premises. The relationship is that the conclusion \"The fribble was snurgled\" logically follows from the premise \"The fribble crinked\" and the premise \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\"\n\nNext, we need to determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. To do this, we need to use the rules of inference.\n\nOne rule of inference is the modus ponens rule, which states that if a conclusion follows from two premises, then the conclusion logically follows from the first premise and the second premise.\n\nUsing the modus ponens rule, we can infer the conclusion \"The fribble was snurgled\" from the premises \"The fribble crinked\" and \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes. We can infer the conclusion \"The fribble was snurgled\" from the given premises.",
