If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The sprocket was cranked,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the meaning of the words \"daggled\" and \"cranked.\" \"Daggled\" means to be bent or twisted, and \"cranked\" means to turn or rotate.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given premises:\n\n1. The sprocket was daggled.\n\nThis means that the sprocket was bent or twisted.\n\n2. If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n\nThis means that if the sprocket was turned or rotated, then it would be bent or twisted.\n\nNow, let's use the premises to infer the conclusion:\n\nIf the sprocket was cranked, then it would be bent or twisted.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sprocket was cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
