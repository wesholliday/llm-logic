If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\n\nTo infer \"The flugel was blimmed,\" we need to use logical reasoning to connect the premises. We can do this by using the conditional statement \"If A, then B,\" where A is the antecedent and B is the consequent.\n\nIn this case, the antecedent is \"If the flugel was blimmed,\" and the consequent is \"The flugel was zargled.\" If we assume that the flugel was blimmed, then we can infer that the flugel was zargled. Therefore, we can infer that the flugel was blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
