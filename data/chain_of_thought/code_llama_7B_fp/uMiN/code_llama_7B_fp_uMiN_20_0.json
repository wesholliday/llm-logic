The word \"might\" is used in the question, which suggests that the possibility of the sunglasses not being in her bag is not explicitly ruled out.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag. The possibility of the sunglasses not being in her bag is still open.\n\nAnswer: No.",
