The word \"must\" in the question implies a certainty or certainty-like quality, which is not necessarily the case.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the context and the information provided. We don't know for sure whether the scarf is stuffed in your backpack or not. The question is asking us to infer whether it's not the case that the scarf must be stuffed in your backpack.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no, we cannot infer that the scarf must not be stuffed in my backpack. We need more information or context to make a conclusion about this.\n\nAnswer: No.",
