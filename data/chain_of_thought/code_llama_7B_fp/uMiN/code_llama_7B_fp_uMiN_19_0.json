The question is asking for a yes or no answer, so we need to explain our reasoning before answering.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe question is asking whether we can infer that it's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser. This means that we need to consider the possibility that the watch might not be charging on the dresser. If the watch is not charging on the dresser, then it is not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
