If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\nWe want to infer whether or not Sue chose pizza.\n\nTo do this, we can use the second statement to our advantage. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. This means that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nHowever, we are not given any information about what Bob chose. We only know that he might not have chosen pasta. This means that it is possible that Bob chose pizza, and that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Sue did not choose pizza. We can only conclude that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: No.",
