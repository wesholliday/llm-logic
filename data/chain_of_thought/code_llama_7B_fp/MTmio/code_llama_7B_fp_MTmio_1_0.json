This means that Sue could have been at the wedding or she could not have been at the wedding.\n\nStep 2: We also know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding.\n\nStep 3: Therefore, if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue must not have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
