If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\n\nTo infer 'The alien did not visit Mars', we need to use logical reasoning and the given statements.\n\nFirst, we need to consider the possibility that the robot did visit Jupiter. If the robot did visit Jupiter, then it is possible that the alien visited Mars. However, this does not necessarily mean that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nSecond, we need to consider the possibility that the robot did not visit Jupiter. If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then it is possible that the alien did not visit Mars. However, this does not necessarily mean that the alien did visit Mars.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The alien did not visit Mars' based on the given statements alone. We need to consider other factors or evidence to make a conclusion about the alien's visit to Mars.\n\nAnswer: No.",
