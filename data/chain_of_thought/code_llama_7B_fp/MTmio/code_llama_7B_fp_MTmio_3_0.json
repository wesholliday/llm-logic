It could be any type of book.\n\n2. \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel\"\n\nThis statement means that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel.\n\n3. \"The book was not written by James\"\n\nThis statement is the conclusion we want to draw.\n\nLogical reasoning:\n\nIf the book was not written by James, then it is possible that it is not a mystery novel. However, if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. Therefore, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
