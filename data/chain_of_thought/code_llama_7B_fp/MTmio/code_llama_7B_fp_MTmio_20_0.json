If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\n\nTo infer whether the apple was red or not, we need to consider both statements and their logical relationships.\n\n1. The banana might not have been yellow. This statement does not provide any information about the apple.\n2. If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. This statement only provides a condition for the banana to be yellow, but it does not say anything about the apple.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer anything about the apple based on these two statements alone. We need more information or additional statements to make a conclusion about the apple's color.\n\nAnswer: No.",
