If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\n\nTo infer whether Jeff did not play basketball, we need to consider the possible combinations of the given premises.\n\nIf Amy did not play tennis, then it is possible that Jeff did not play basketball. In this case, the premise \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis\" does not hold, and we cannot infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nOn the other hand, if Amy did play tennis, then it is necessary that Jeff played basketball, since the premise \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis\" holds. In this case, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes.",
