If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The griffin was not in the forest,\" we need to use logical reasoning and the given premises.\n\nFirst, we need to consider the possibility that the unicorn was not in the forest. If the unicorn was not in the forest, then it is possible that the griffin was not in the forest either.\n\nSecond, we need to consider the possibility that the griffin was in the forest. If the griffin was in the forest, then it is necessary that the unicorn was also in the forest, as stated in the second premise.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest, as the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
