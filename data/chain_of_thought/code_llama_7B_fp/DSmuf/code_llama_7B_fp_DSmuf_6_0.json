It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen.\n\nWe need to use logical reasoning to infer the conclusion that the phone is in the living room.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the phone is in the kitchen by using the second statement. If the phone must be ringing in the kitchen, then the second statement would be false, which means that the phone cannot be in the kitchen.\n\nTherefore, the only remaining possibility is that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
