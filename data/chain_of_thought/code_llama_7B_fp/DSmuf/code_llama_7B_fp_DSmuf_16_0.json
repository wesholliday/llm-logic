The first statement is \"Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag.\" This statement is a logical contradiction, as it implies that the pen must be on my desk or it must be in my bag, but it cannot be both.\n\nThe second statement is \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\" This statement is a logical negation of the first statement, which means that the pen cannot be on my desk.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the pen must be in my bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
