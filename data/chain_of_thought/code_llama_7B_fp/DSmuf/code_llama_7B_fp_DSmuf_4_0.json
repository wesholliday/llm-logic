The first premise states that either the cat is playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch. The second premise states that it's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom.\n\nIf we assume that the cat is playing in the bedroom, then the second premise would be false, as it's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom. Therefore, we can conclude that the cat is not playing in the bedroom.\n\nOn the other hand, if we assume that the cat is napping on the couch, then the first premise would be false, as the cat is not playing in the bedroom. Therefore, we can conclude that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
