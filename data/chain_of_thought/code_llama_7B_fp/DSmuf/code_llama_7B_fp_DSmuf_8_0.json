It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\n\nWe can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table because the first statement implies that the remote control is either hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table. The second statement contradicts the first statement, so we can conclude that the remote control is not hiding under the couch. Therefore, the remote control must be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
