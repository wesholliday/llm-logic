It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\n\nWe need to use logical reasoning to infer the conclusion that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the notebook is sitting on the nightstand by considering the second statement. If the notebook were sitting on the nightstand, then the first statement would not be true, since the notebook is not in the drawer. Therefore, we can conclude that the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand.\n\nNext, we can consider the first statement. If the notebook is in the drawer, then the first statement is true, since the notebook is either in the drawer or it is not in the drawer. However, if the notebook is not in the drawer, then the first statement is not true, since the notebook is not in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
