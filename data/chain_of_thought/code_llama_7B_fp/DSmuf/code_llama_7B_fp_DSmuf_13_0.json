It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nWe need to use logical reasoning to infer the conclusion that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the toy is sitting on the bookshelf by considering the second statement. If the toy were sitting on the bookshelf, then the first statement would not be true, since the toy is not sitting on the bookshelf. Therefore, we can conclude that the toy is not sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nNext, we can consider the first statement. If the toy is in the toy box, then the first statement is true, since the toy is either sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box. However, if the toy is not in the toy box, then the first statement is not true, since the toy is not sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
