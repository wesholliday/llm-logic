It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\n\nWe need to use logical reasoning to infer the conclusion that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry, because the second statement says that it's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry. So, the cookies must be in the jar.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
