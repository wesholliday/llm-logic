It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n\nWe need to use logical reasoning to infer the conclusion that Fido is inside.\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the possibility that Fido must be in the garden.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden. This means that Fido cannot be in the garden.\n\nStep 2: Consider the possibility that Fido is inside.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside. This means that if Fido is not in the garden, then it must be inside.\n\nStep 3: Infer that Fido is inside.\n\nBased on the information provided, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
