It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box,\" we need to consider the possible interpretations of the given premises and the relationship between them.\n\nThe first premise suggests that the missing puzzle piece could be either on the floor or in the box. The second premise, on the other hand, states that the missing puzzle piece cannot be on the floor.\n\nIf we assume that the missing puzzle piece is not on the floor, then it must be in the box. This is because the first premise suggests that the missing puzzle piece could be in the box or on the floor, but the second premise rules out the possibility that it is on the floor. Therefore, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
