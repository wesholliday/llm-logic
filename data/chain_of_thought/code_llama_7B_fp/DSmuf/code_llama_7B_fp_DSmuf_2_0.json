It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\n\nWe need to determine whether we can infer the statement \"The book is on the shelf\" from these two statements.\n\nTo do this, we need to analyze the meaning of each statement and determine whether they are logically consistent with each other.\n\nThe first statement \"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf\" is a conditional statement, which means that it is true if and only if the antecedent (the part before the \"if\") is true and the consequent (the part after the \"if\") is true. In this case, the antecedent is \"the book must be resting on the table\" and the consequent is \"it is on the shelf\".\n\nThe second statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" is a negation of the first statement, which means that it is true if and only if the first statement is false.\n\nNow, let's analyze the two statements together:\n\nIf the first statement is true, then the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf. If the second statement is true, then it is not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\n\nIf we assume that the first statement is true, then we can infer that the book is on the shelf. However, if we assume that the second statement is true, then we can infer that the book is not on the shelf, which contradicts our assumption that the book is on the shelf.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"The book is on the shelf\" from the two given statements.\n\nAnswer: No.",
