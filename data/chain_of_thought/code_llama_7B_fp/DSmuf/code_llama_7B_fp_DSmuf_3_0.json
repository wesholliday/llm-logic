It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\n\nWe need to use these two statements to infer whether the keys are in the drawer or not.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first statement:\n\n\"Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer.\"\n\nThis statement is a logical contradiction, as it implies that the keys can be in either the cabinet or the drawer, but not both. Therefore, we can conclude that the keys must be in the drawer.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement:\n\n\"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nThis statement is a logical contradiction, as it implies that the keys cannot be in the cabinet, but we have already established that the keys must be in the drawer. Therefore, we can conclude that the keys must be in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
