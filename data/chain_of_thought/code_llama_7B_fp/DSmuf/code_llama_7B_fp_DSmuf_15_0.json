The first premise states that either the shoes must be lined up by the door or they are in the closet. The second premise states that it is not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door.\n\nIf we assume that the shoes must be lined up by the door, then the second premise would imply that the shoes are not in the closet, which contradicts the first premise. Therefore, we can conclude that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
