However, the statement \"If I exercise and eat junk food, I will lose weight\" is a more specific and nuanced statement that takes into account the potential impact of diet on weight loss.\n\nWhile exercise is still a crucial component of weight loss, the addition of junk food to the diet can negate the benefits of exercise and potentially lead to weight gain. Therefore, the statement \"If I exercise and eat junk food, I will lose weight\" is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: No.",
