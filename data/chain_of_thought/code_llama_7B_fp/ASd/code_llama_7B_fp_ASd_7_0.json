            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement, which means that it is a statement that is true only if certain conditions are met. In this case, the condition is that the oven is on.\n\nThe statement \"If the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm\" means that if the oven is on, then the kitchen will be warm because the oven is heating up the kitchen.\n\nNow, let's consider the new statement \"If the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm.\" This statement is a conditional statement, and it is a more specific version of the previous statement. It means that if the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen will be warm.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer the new statement from the previous one, we need to consider the conditions that are mentioned in the previous statement. In this case, the condition is that the oven is on.\n\nIf the oven is on, then the kitchen will be warm, regardless of whether the pilot light is out or not. Therefore, we can infer the new statement from the previous one.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
