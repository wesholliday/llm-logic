However, the statement does not explicitly mention the timing of the submission. Therefore, it is not clear whether the student's grade will be affected by the essay's submission time.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A.\" This is because the essay's quality and the timing of its submission are two separate factors that may affect the student's grade.\n\nAnswer: No.",
