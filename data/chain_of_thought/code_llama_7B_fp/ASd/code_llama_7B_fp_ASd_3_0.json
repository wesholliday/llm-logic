However, this statement does not necessarily imply that if the car is in the garage and the garage is flooding, it is safe.\n\nFor example, if the garage is flooding and the car is in the garage, it may not be safe because the flooding could cause damage to the car or make it difficult to access. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the car is in the garage and the garage is flooding, it is safe.\n\nAnswer: No.",
