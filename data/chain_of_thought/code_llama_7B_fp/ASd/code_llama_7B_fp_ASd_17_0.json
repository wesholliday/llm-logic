However, it does not necessarily mean that changing the oil will fix any other issues with the car, such as a shot transmission.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if we change the oil and the transmission is shot, the car will run smoothly. It is possible that the transmission issue may still be present even after changing the oil, and the car may not run smoothly even if the oil is changed.\n\nAnswer: No.",
