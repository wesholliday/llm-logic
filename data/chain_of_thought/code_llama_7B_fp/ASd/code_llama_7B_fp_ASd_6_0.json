However, the addition of the phrase \"and I am wearing earplugs\" does not necessarily change the meaning of the statement.\n\nIf we assume that the speaker is wearing earplugs, then the statement \"If you scream, it will hurt my ears\" would still be true, as the earplugs would not protect the ears from the pain caused by the scream.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"If you scream and I am wearing earplugs, it will hurt my ears\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
