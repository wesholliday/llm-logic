Either the cat is napping on the couch or it's playing in the bedroom.\n2. The cat isn't playing in the bedroom.\n\nTo infer the conclusion, we need to use the first premise to eliminate the possibility that the cat is playing in the bedroom. If the cat is playing in the bedroom, then the first premise would be false, and we would not be able to infer the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
