The first statement \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry\" implies that the cookies are either in the jar or hidden in the pantry. The second statement \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry\" further narrows down the possibilities, as it rules out the possibility that the cookies are hidden in the pantry. Therefore, we can conclude that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
