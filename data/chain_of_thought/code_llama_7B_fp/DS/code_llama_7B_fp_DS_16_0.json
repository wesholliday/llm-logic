The first statement is \"Either the pen is in my bag or it is on my desk.\" This statement implies that the pen is either in my bag or on my desk, but it does not specify which one it is in.\n\nThe second statement is \"The pen isn't on my desk.\" This statement contradicts the first statement, as it implies that the pen is not on my desk.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the pen is in my bag, as the first statement implies that it is either in my bag or on my desk, and the second statement contradicts the first statement, implying that the pen is in my bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
