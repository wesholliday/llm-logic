Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it is sitting on the porch.\n2. The newspaper isn't sitting on the porch.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the newspaper is either in the driveway or it is sitting on the porch. If the newspaper is sitting on the porch, then it is not in the driveway.

This contradicts the first statement, which implies that the newspaper is either in the driveway or it is sitting on the porch. Therefore, we can infer that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
