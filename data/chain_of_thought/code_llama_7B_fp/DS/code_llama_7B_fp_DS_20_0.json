The first part of the statement, \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they are perched on her head,\" suggests that the sunglasses are either in her bag or on her head. The second part of the statement, \"The sunglasses aren't perched on her head,\" further narrows down the possibilities. If the sunglasses are perched on her head, then the first part of the statement would not be true. Therefore, the only possibility left is that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
