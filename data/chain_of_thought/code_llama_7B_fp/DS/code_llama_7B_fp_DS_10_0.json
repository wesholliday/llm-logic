The first statement, \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it's under the bed,\" implies that the missing sock is either in the laundry basket or under the bed. The second statement, \"The missing sock isn't under the bed,\" further narrows down the possibilities. If the missing sock is not under the bed, then it must be in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
