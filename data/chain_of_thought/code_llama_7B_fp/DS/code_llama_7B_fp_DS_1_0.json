Fido is not in the garden.\n\nWe need to determine whether we can infer that Fido is inside based on these two statements.\n\nTo do this, we need to analyze the statements and determine whether they are logically consistent with each other.\n\nThe first statement says that either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden. This means that if Fido is not in the garden, then it must be inside.\n\nThe second statement says that Fido is not in the garden. This means that if Fido is not in the garden, then it cannot be in the garden.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
