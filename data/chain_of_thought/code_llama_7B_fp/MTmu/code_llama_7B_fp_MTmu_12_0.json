It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nTo infer whether Joe did not go to the park, we need to analyze the given statements and their logical relationships.\n\n1. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\nThis statement implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo as well.\n2. It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\nThis statement asserts that it is not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationships between the given statements:\n\n1. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n2. It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nBased on the given statements, we can infer that:\n\n1.
