It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\n\nWe need to determine whether we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nTo do this, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements. The first statement implies that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. This means that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim, but it does not necessarily mean that the pants were denim.\n\nThe second statement states that it's not the case that the pants must have been denim. This means that the pants were not necessarily denim, even if the shirt was cotton.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton, because if the shirt was cotton, then the pants would have been denim, but they were not necessarily denim.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
