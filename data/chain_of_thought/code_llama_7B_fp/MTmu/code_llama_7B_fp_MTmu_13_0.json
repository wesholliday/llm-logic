It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\n\nTo infer the conclusion, we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\n1. Premise 1: If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\n2. Premise 2: It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\n3. Conclusion: The car was not red.\n\nTo infer the conclusion, we need to use the following rule of inference:\n\nIf A implies B, and B is false, then A is false.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nIf the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. (Premise 1)\n\nAnd:\n\nIt's not the case that the truck must have been blue. (Premise 2)\n\nSo, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
