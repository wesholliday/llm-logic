If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\n2. It's not the case that the cat must have been outside.\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer that the dog was not inside. This is because if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside, but we know that it's not the case that the cat must have been outside. Therefore, we can conclude that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
