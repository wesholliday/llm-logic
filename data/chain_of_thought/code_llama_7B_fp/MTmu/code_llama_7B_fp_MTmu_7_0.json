It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race.\n\nTo infer whether Alex did not finish the race, we need to consider the truth table of the given statements:\n\n| Statement | Truth Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race | T |\n| It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race | F |\n\nNow, we can use the following rules of inference:\n\n1. If the premises are true, and the conclusion is false, then we can infer the negation of the conclusion.\n2. If the premises are false, and the conclusion is true, then we can infer the negation of the premises.\n\nApplying these rules, we can infer that:\n\n1. If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\n2. It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that:\n\n1. Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
