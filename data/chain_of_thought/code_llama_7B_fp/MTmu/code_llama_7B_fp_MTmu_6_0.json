It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\nWe need to determine whether we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nTo do this, we need to consider the truth table for the two statements:\n\n| Statement 1 | Statement 2 | Inference |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. | It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta. | Yes |\n\nIn this table, we can see that the inference is \"Yes\" because the two statements are both true. Therefore, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
