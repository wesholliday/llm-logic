It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\n\nTo infer whether Mary was not at the wedding, we need to analyze the given statements and their logical relationships.\n\nFirstly, we need to consider the first statement. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding.\n\nSecondly, we need to consider the second statement. It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. This means that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's analyze the two statements together. If Mary was at the wedding and Sue was not at the wedding, then it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. This means that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
