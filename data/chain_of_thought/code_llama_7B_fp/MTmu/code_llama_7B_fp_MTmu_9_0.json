It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nWe need to determine whether we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nTo do this, we need to consider the truth table for the two statements:\n\n| Statement 1 | Statement 2 | Inference |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Lisa bought the red shirt | Mark must have bought the blue shirt | Yes |\n| It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt | Lisa bought the red shirt | No |\n\nIn this table, we can see that if Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false, then we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Therefore, the inference is \"No\".",
