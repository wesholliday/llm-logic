It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\n\nWe need to use these premises to infer whether the vampire was awake or not.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the possibility that the mummy was awake by using the second premise. If the mummy was awake, then it would be the case that the mummy must have been awake, which contradicts the second premise. Therefore, we can conclude that the mummy was not awake.\n\nNext, we can use the first premise to infer whether the vampire was awake or not. If the vampire was awake, then it would be the case that the vampire was awake, which would contradict the second premise. Therefore, we can conclude that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
