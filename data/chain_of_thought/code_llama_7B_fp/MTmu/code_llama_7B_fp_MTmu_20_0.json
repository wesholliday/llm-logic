It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\n\nTo infer the conclusion, we need to use logical reasoning and the rules of inference.\n\n1. Premise 1: If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\n2. Premise 2: It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\n3. Conclusion: The apple was not red.\n\nTo infer the conclusion, we need to use the following rule of inference:\n\nIf A implies B, and B is false, then A is false.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nIf the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. (Premise 1)\n\nAnd:\n\nIt's not the case that the banana must have been yellow. (Premise 2)\n\nSo, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
