It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\n\nTo infer whether the book was written by James or not, we need to consider the relationship between the two premises. If the first premise is true, then the second premise must be false, since the first premise implies that the book must be a mystery novel. Therefore, if the first premise is true, then the book must be a mystery novel, and the second premise is false.\n\nOn the other hand, if the first premise is false, then the second premise is true, since the second premise states that the book must not be a mystery novel. Therefore, if the first premise is false, then the book may or may not be written by James, and the second premise is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer whether the book was written by James or not based on the given premises. We need more information or evidence to make a conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No",
