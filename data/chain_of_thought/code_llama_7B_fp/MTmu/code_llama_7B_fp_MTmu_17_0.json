It's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad.\n\nTo infer whether Ben did not eat pasta, we need to consider the possible interpretations of the given premises and the conclusion we want to draw.\n\nIf we interpret the first premise as \"If Ben ate pasta, then he must have eaten the salad,\" then the conclusion \"Ben did not eat pasta\" follows logically. This is because if Ben did not eat pasta, then he did not eat the salad, and therefore the second premise is not applicable.\n\nOn the other hand, if we interpret the first premise as \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten the salad,\" then the conclusion \"Ben did not eat pasta\" does not follow logically. This is because if Ben did not eat pasta, then he did not eat the salad, and therefore the second premise is not applicable.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Ben did not eat pasta\" does not follow logically from the given premises, and we cannot infer it.\n\nAnswer: No.",
