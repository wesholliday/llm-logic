It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\n\nTo infer whether Sam did not take a plane, we need to consider the implications of the given premises.\n\nIf Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. This means that if Sam took a plane, Erin did not take a train.\n\nOn the other hand, it's not the case that Erin must have taken a train. This means that Erin did not have to take a train, and she could have taken a different mode of transportation.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
