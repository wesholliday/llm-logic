The conclusion does not follow from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. This means that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train, but it does not necessarily mean that Erin took a train if Sam did not take a plane.\n\nThe second premise states that Erin did not take a train. This is a separate statement from the first premise, and it does not necessarily contradict the first premise.\n\nThe conclusion states that Sam did not take a plane. This conclusion follows from the first premise, but it does not follow from the second premise. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
