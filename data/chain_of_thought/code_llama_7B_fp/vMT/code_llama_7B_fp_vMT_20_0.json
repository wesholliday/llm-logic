The first premise, \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow,\" is a conditional statement that asserts a causal relationship between the apple's color and the banana's color. However, the second premise, \"The banana was not yellow,\" is a statement about the banana's color that is not necessarily related to the apple's color.\n\nThe conclusion, \"The apple was not red,\" is also a conditional statement that asserts a causal relationship between the apple's color and its non-redness. However, the argument does not provide any evidence to support the conclusion. In fact, the argument's second premise contradicts the conclusion, as the banana's yellowness is not related to the apple's redness.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.",
