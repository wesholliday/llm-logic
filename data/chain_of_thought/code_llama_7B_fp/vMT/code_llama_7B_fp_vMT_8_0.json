The conclusion does not follow from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This means that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would also be awake.\n\nThe second premise states that the mummy was not awake. This means that the mummy was not awake, regardless of whether the vampire was awake or not.\n\nThe conclusion states that the vampire was not awake. This conclusion does not follow from the premises. In fact, it is possible that the vampire was awake and the mummy was not awake, which would contradict the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, this argument is not logically valid.",
