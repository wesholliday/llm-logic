The conclusion does not follow from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. This means that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad as well.\n\nThe second premise states that Kate did not eat salad. This means that Kate did not eat salad, regardless of whether Ben ate pasta or not.\n\nThe conclusion states that Ben did not eat pasta. This means that Ben did not eat pasta, regardless of whether Kate ate salad or not.\n\nHowever, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad, regardless of whether Ben ate pasta or not. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
