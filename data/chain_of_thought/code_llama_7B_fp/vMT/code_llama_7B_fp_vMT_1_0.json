The conclusion does not follow from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This is a conditional statement, which means that the conclusion follows from the premise if the condition is true. In this case, the condition is that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nThe second premise states that Sue was not at the wedding. This is an independent statement that does not affect the validity of the argument.\n\nThe conclusion states that Mary was not at the wedding. This conclusion does not follow from the premises. If the premise that Mary was at the wedding is false, then the conclusion that Sue was not at the wedding is also false. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
