The first premise, \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race,\" is a conditional statement that implies a causal relationship between the two events. However, the second premise, \"Chris did not finish the race,\" is a statement that Chris did not perform the action of finishing the race, which does not necessarily imply that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion, \"Alex did not finish the race,\" is not necessarily true. In fact, it is possible that Alex finished the race and Chris did not, which would be consistent with the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
