If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure of these statements:\n\n1. The flob was skizzled (A).\n2. If A, then the flob movated (B).\n\nSince we know that A is true (the flob was skizzled), and we have a conditional statement that says if A is true, then B must also be true (the flob movated), we can infer that B is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
