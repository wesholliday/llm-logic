We are also given the conditional statement \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the logic:\n\n- The first statement tells us that the fribble was indeed snurgled.\n- The second statement tells us that if the fribble was snurgled (which we know it was), then the fribble crinked.\n\nSince the condition in the second statement is met (the fribble was snurgled), we can infer that the consequence (the fribble crinked) is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
