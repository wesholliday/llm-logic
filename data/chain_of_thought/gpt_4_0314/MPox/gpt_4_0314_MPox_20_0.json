If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\n\nWe are asked to infer if \"The fleeg surned\" based on these statements.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can see that statement 2 is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the fleeg was bluttered) is true, then the result (it surned) must also be true.\n\nSince statement 1 confirms that the condition (the fleeg was bluttered) is true, we can conclude that the result (it surned) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
