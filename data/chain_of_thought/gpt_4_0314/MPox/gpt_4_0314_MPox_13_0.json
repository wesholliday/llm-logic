If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\n\nWe are asked to infer if \"The glip was tragged.\"\n\nUsing the information given, we can see that the first statement tells us that the glip was indeed slogged. The second statement is a conditional statement that says if the glip was slogged, then it must also be tragged.\n\nSince we know that the glip was slogged (from statement 1), we can apply the conditional statement (statement 2) and conclude that the glip must also be tragged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
