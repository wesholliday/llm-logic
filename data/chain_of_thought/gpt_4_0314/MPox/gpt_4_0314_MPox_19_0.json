We are also given the conditional statement \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the logic:\n\nSince we know that \"The smonk was vreebled\" is true, and the conditional statement tells us that if this is true, then \"the smonk plagged\" must also be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The smonk plagged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
