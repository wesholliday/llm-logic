We are also given the conditional statement \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the logic:\n\nSince the first statement tells us that the dreb was indeed vroombed, we can use the conditional statement to infer what happens when the dreb is vroombed. The conditional statement tells us that if the dreb was vroombed, then it must also be spened.\n\nSince we know the dreb was vroombed, we can conclude that the dreb was spened.\n\nAnswer: yes",
