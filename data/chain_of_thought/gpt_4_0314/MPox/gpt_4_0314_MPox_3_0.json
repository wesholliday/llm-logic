If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\n\nWe are asked to infer if \"The splat quanked.\"\n\nUsing the information given, we can apply modus ponens, a logical rule that states if we have a conditional statement (if P, then Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" (If P, then Q). The antecedent (P) is \"The splat was morphed,\" which is given as true. Therefore, we can conclude that the consequent (Q), \"The splat quanked,\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
