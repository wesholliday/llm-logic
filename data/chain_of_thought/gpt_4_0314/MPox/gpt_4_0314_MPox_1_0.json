If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\n\nWe can represent this information using logical notation:\n\n1. B (Blimmed)\n2. B \u2192 Z (If Blimmed, then Zargled)\n\nNow, we can use the Modus Ponens rule of inference, which states that if we have a conditional statement (B \u2192 Z) and the antecedent (B) is true, then we can infer the consequent (Z) is true.\n\nSince we know the flugel was blimmed (B), and we have the conditional statement (B \u2192 Z), we can infer that the flugel was zargled (Z).\n\nAnswer: yes",
