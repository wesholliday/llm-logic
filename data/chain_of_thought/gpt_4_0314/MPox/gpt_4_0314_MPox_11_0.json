If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\n\nWe are asked if we can infer \"The flug was zimmed\" from these statements.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can see that this is an example of modus ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (if P, then Q) and we know that P is true, then we can infer that Q is true.\n\nIn this case, P is \"the flug was blummed\" and Q is \"the flug was zimmed\". Since we know that P is true (from statement 1), and we have the conditional statement (from statement 2), we can infer that Q is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
