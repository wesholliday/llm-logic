If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the shank was nugged.\n\nUsing the information given, we can see that the first statement tells us that the shank was indeed plooked. The second statement is a conditional statement that tells us that if the shank was plooked, then it must also be nugged.\n\nSince we know that the shank was plooked, we can apply the conditional statement and conclude that the shank was nugged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
