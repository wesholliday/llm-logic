We are also given the conditional statement \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the logic:\n\nSince we know that \"The clug was fleeked\" is true, we can use the conditional statement to infer what happens when the clug is fleeked. The conditional statement tells us that if the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\n\nSince we know the clug was fleeked, we can conclude that the clug snugged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
