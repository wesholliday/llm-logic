We are also given the conditional statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the logic:\n\nSince we know that \"The zinger was fraggled,\" we can use the conditional statement to infer what happens when the zinger is fraggled. The conditional statement tells us that if the zinger is fraggled, then it must also be smoogled.\n\nSince we know the zinger was indeed fraggled, we can conclude that the zinger was smoogled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
