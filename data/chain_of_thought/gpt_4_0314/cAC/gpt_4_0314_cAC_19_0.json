Jen watched basketball.\n\nWe are asked to determine if we can conclude that Tom watched football.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Tom watched football) is true, then the second part (Jen watched basketball) must also be true. However, this does not mean that if the second part is true, the first part must also be true.\n\nIn this case, we know that Jen watched basketball (statement 2), but we do not have enough information to determine whether Tom watched football or not. It is possible that Jen watched basketball for some other reason, unrelated to Tom watching football.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that Tom watched football based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
