The truck was metal.\n\nWe are asked to determine if we can conclude that the doll was plastic.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the doll being plastic) is true, then the result (the truck being metal) must also be true. However, this statement does not guarantee that the doll being plastic is the only way for the truck to be metal.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the truck was indeed metal. However, this information alone does not provide any direct information about the doll.\n\nSince we do not have enough information to guarantee that the doll was plastic, we cannot conclude that the doll was plastic based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
