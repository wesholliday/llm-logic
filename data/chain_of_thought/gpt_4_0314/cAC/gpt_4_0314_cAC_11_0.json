The muffins were blueberry.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logic:\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the cake was chocolate) is true, then the second part (the muffins were blueberry) must also be true. However, this does not mean that if the second part is true, the first part must also be true.\n\nIn other words, the fact that the muffins were blueberry does not necessarily mean that the cake was chocolate. There could be other reasons for the muffins being blueberry.\n\nSo, we cannot conclude that the cake was chocolate based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
