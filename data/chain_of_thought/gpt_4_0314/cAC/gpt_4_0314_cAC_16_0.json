The pants were denim.\n\nWe are asked to determine if we can conclude that the shirt was cotton.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (shirt being cotton) is true, then the result (pants being denim) must also be true. However, this statement does not guarantee that the shirt being cotton is the only way for the pants to be denim.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the pants were indeed denim. But this information alone does not provide enough evidence to conclude that the shirt was cotton. There could be other reasons for the pants being denim that are not mentioned.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that the shirt was cotton based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
