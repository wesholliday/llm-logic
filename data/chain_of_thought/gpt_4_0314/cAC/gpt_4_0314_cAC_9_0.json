Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the second part (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true. However, this does not mean that if the second part is true, the first part must also be true.\n\nIn this case, we know that Mark bought the blue shirt (from the second statement), but we cannot conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt based on this information alone. The first statement only tells us what happens if Lisa bought the red shirt, not what happens if Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
