The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Alex finishing the race) is true, then the second part (Chris finishing the race) must also be true. However, this statement does not guarantee that if Chris finished the race, then Alex must have finished the race as well.\n\nThe second statement tells us that Chris finished the race. But this information alone does not provide any direct information about whether Alex finished the race or not.\n\nSince we do not have enough information to definitively conclude that Alex finished the race, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no",
