Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Joe going to the park) is true, then the second part (Lucy going to the zoo) must also be true. However, this statement does not guarantee that if Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe must have gone to the park. It is possible that Lucy went to the zoo for some other reason.\n\nThe second statement tells us that Lucy did go to the zoo. But we cannot conclude from this information alone that Joe went to the park, as there could be other reasons for Lucy going to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: no",
