The banana was yellow.\n\nWe are asked to determine if we can conclude that the apple was red.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the apple being red) is true, then the second part (the banana being yellow) must also be true. However, this statement does not guarantee that the apple being red is the only condition for the banana being yellow.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the banana was indeed yellow. But this information alone does not provide enough evidence to conclude that the apple was red. There could be other reasons for the banana being yellow that are not mentioned in the given statements.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that the apple was red.\n\nAnswer: no",
