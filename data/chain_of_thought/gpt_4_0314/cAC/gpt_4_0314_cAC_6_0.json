The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Sue choosing pizza) is true, then the second part (Bob choosing pasta) must also be true. However, this does not mean that if the second part is true, the first part must also be true.\n\nIn this case, we know that Bob chose pasta (statement 2), but we cannot conclude that Sue chose pizza based on this information alone. It is possible that Sue chose something else, and Bob still chose pasta. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Sue chose pizza.\n\nAnswer: no",
