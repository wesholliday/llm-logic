The mummy was awake.\n\nWe are asked to determine if we can conclude that the vampire was awake.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: V -> M, where V represents the vampire being awake and M represents the mummy being awake. The second statement tells us that M is true.\n\nHowever, the given information does not provide a direct link between the mummy being awake and the vampire being awake. The conditional statement only tells us that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is awake. It does not tell us that if the mummy is awake, then the vampire must be awake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that the vampire was awake based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
