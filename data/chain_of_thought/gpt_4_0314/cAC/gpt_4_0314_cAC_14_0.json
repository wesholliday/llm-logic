The wolf was in the den.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure of the first statement. It is an \"if-then\" statement, which is a conditional statement. In this case, the presence of the bear in the cave is the condition, and the presence of the wolf in the den is the consequence.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the wolf was indeed in the den. However, this information alone does not guarantee that the bear was in the cave. It is possible that the wolf was in the den for some other reason, unrelated to the bear's location.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that the bear was in the cave based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
