If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A, then B. In this case, A represents \"the car was red\" and B represents \"the truck was blue.\"\n\n2. The truck was blue.\nThis statement is a fact, which means B is true.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can conclude that the car was red (A) based on the given information.\n\nIn a conditional statement, if A is true, then B must be true. However, if B is true, it does not necessarily mean that A is true. There could be other reasons for B being true that are not related to A.\n\nIn this case, we know that the truck was blue (B is true), but we cannot conclude that the car was red (A) based solely on the given information. There could be other reasons for the truck being blue that are not related to the car being red.\n\nAnswer: no",
