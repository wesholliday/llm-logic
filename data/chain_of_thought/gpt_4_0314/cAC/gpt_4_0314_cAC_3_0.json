If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\nThis statement can be represented as: If A, then B (where A = the book was written by James, and B = the book is a mystery novel).\n\n2. The book is a mystery novel.\nThis statement is simply B.\n\nNow, we are asked if we can conclude A (the book was written by James) from these statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement (If A, then B), which means that if A is true, then B must be true. However, it does not guarantee that if B is true, then A must be true. There could be other reasons for B being true, such as the book being written by another author who also writes mystery novels.\n\nSince we only know that B is true (the book is a mystery novel), we cannot definitively conclude that A (the book was written by James) is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
