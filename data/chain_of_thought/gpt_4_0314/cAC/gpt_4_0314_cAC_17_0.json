Kate ate salad.\n\nWe are asked to determine if we can conclude that Ben ate pasta.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the second part (Kate ate salad) must also be true. However, this does not mean that if the second part is true, the first part must also be true.\n\nIn this case, we know that Kate ate salad (statement 2), but we do not have enough information to determine whether Ben ate pasta. It is possible that Kate ate salad regardless of whether Ben ate pasta or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that Ben ate pasta based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
