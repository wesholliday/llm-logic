The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are two possibilities for the location of the remote control: on the coffee table or under the couch. Statement 2 tells us that it's possible that the remote control is not under the couch. Since there are only two possible locations, if it's not under the couch, then it must be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
