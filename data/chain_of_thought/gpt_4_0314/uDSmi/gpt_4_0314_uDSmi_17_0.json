The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are two possibilities for the location of the scarf: in the backpack or on the coat rack. Statement 2 tells us that it's possible that the scarf is not on the coat rack. However, it doesn't confirm that the scarf is definitely not on the coat rack.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to rule out the possibility of the scarf being on the coat rack, we cannot definitively infer that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack. \n\nAnswer: no",
