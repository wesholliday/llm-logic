The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are two possibilities: cookies are in the jar or in the pantry. Statement 2 tells us that it's possible that the cookies are not in the pantry. However, it doesn't confirm that the cookies are definitely not in the pantry.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to rule out the possibility of the cookies being in the pantry, we cannot definitively infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: no",
