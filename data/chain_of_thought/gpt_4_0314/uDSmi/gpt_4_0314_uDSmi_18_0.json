The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are two possibilities for the location of the notebook: in the drawer or on the nightstand. Statement 2 tells us that it's possible that the notebook is not on the nightstand. However, it doesn't confirm that the notebook is definitely not on the nightstand.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to rule out the possibility of the notebook being on the nightstand, we cannot definitively infer that the notebook is in the drawer. \n\nAnswer: no",
