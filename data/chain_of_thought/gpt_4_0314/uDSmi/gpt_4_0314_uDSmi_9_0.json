The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are two possibilities: the piece is in the box or it's blending in on the floor. Statement 2 tells us that it's possible that the piece is not blending in on the floor. However, it doesn't completely rule out the possibility that the piece is blending in on the floor.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to completely rule out the possibility that the piece is blending in on the floor, we cannot definitively infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: no",
