The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are two possibilities for the jacket's location: draped over the chair or hanging in the closet. Statement 2 tells us that it's possible that the jacket is not hanging in the closet. However, it doesn't confirm that the jacket is definitely not in the closet.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to rule out the possibility that the jacket is hanging in the closet, we cannot definitively infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: no",
