The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are two possibilities for the location of the sunglasses: in her bag or on her head. Statement 2 tells us that it's possible that the sunglasses are not on her head. However, it doesn't confirm that they are definitely not on her head.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to rule out the possibility that the sunglasses are on her head, we cannot definitively infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: no",
