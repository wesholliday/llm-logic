The toy might not be sitting on the shelf.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are two possibilities for the location of the toy: in the toy box or on the shelf. Statement 2 tells us that it's possible that the toy is not on the shelf. Since there are only two possible locations for the toy, and it might not be on the shelf, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
