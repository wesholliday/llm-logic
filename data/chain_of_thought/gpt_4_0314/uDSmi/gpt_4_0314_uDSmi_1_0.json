Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\nThis statement tells us that there are two possibilities for Fido's location: inside or in the garden. There are no other options mentioned.\n\n2. Fido might not be in the garden.\nThis statement tells us that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. However, it does not confirm that Fido is definitely not in the garden.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements and see if we can infer that Fido is inside:\n\nSince there are only two possible locations for Fido (inside or in the garden), and there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, we can infer that there is a possibility that Fido is inside. However, we cannot definitively conclude that Fido is inside, as the second statement only tells us that Fido might not be in the garden, not that he definitely isn't.\n\nAnswer: no",
