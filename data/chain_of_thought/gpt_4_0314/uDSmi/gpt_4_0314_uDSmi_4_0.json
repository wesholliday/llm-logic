The cat might not be playing in the bedroom.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are two possibilities: the cat is napping on the couch or playing in the bedroom. Statement 2 tells us that it's possible the cat is not playing in the bedroom. However, it doesn't confirm that the cat is definitely not playing in the bedroom.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to rule out the possibility of the cat playing in the bedroom, we cannot definitively infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: no",
