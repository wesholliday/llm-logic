The shoes might not be lined up by the door.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are two possibilities for the location of the shoes: in the closet or by the door. Statement 2 tells us that it's possible that the shoes are not by the door. Since there are only two possible locations for the shoes, and we know that they might not be by the door, we can infer that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
