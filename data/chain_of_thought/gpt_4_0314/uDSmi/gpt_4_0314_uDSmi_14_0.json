The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are two possibilities: the milk is on the counter or it is in the fridge. Statement 2 tells us that it is possible that the milk is not in the fridge. However, it does not confirm that the milk is definitely not in the fridge.\n\nSince we do not have enough information to confirm that the milk is not in the fridge, we cannot definitively infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: no",
