The pen might not be on my desk.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are two possibilities: the pen is in the bag or on the desk. Statement 2 tells us that there is a possibility that the pen is not on the desk. However, this does not confirm that the pen is definitely not on the desk. It just tells us that it might not be there.\n\nSince we do not have enough information to confirm that the pen is not on the desk, we cannot infer that the pen is definitely in the bag. \n\nAnswer: no",
