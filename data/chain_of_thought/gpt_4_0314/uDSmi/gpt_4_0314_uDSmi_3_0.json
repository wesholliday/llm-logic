The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are two possibilities: keys in the drawer or keys in the cabinet. Statement 2 tells us that it's possible that the keys are not in the cabinet. However, it doesn't confirm that the keys are definitely not in the cabinet.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to rule out the possibility of the keys being in the cabinet, we cannot definitively infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: no",
