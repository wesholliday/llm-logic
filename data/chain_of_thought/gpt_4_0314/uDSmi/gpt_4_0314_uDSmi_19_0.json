The watch might not be on his wrist.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are two possibilities: the watch is charging on the dresser, or it is on his wrist. Statement 2 tells us that it is possible that the watch is not on his wrist. However, it does not confirm that the watch is definitely not on his wrist.\n\nSince we do not have enough information to confirm that the watch is not on his wrist, we cannot definitively infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: no",
