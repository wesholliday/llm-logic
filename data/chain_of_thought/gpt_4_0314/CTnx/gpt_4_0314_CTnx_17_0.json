(A = flob was skizzled, B = flob movated)\n\nNow, we want to infer: If the flob movated, then the flob was not skizzled.\nThis can be represented as: If B, then not A.\n\nTo determine if we can infer this, let's look at the contrapositive of the given statement. The contrapositive is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and reversing their order.\n\nContrapositive of the given statement: If not (not B), then not A.\nSimplifying the double negation: If B, then not A.\n\nAs we can see, the contrapositive of the given statement is the same as the statement we want to infer. Therefore, we can infer the statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
