(A = sneg was crampled, B = sneg sproted the frink)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer the following statement:\nIf the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\nThis can be represented as: If B, then not A.\n\nTo determine if we can infer this, let's look at the contrapositive of the given statement. The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then reversing their order. In this case, the contrapositive would be: If not (not B), then not A. Since not (not B) is equivalent to B, the contrapositive can be simplified to: If B, then not A.\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the desired statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
