(A = dreb was vroombed, B = dreb was spened)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer the following statement:\nIf the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed.\nThis can be represented as: If B, then not A.\n\nTo determine if we can infer this, let's look at the contrapositive of the given statement. The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then reversing their order. In this case, the contrapositive would be: If not (not B), then not A. Since not (not B) is the same as B, the contrapositive can be simplified to: If B, then not A.\n\nAs we can see, the contrapositive of the given statement is the same as the statement we want to infer. Therefore, we can infer the statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
