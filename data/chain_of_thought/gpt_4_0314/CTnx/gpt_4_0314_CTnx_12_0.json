(A = smip was shripped, B = smip lupped the zoint)\n\nNow, we want to infer: If the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was not shripped.\nThis can be represented as: If B, then not A.\n\nTo determine if we can infer this, let's look at the contrapositive of the given statement. The contrapositive is formed by negating both the antecedent and the consequent and reversing their order. So, the contrapositive of the given statement would be: If not (not B), then not A. Since not (not B) is the same as B, the contrapositive can be simplified to: If B, then not A.\n\nThe contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, so if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can infer the statement \"If the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was not shripped\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
