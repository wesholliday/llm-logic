(A = fribble was snurgled, B = fribble crink)\n\nStatement to infer: If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled.\nThis can be represented as: If B, then not A.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship between these statements. The given statement tells us that if A is true, then B must be false. The statement we need to infer tells us that if B is true, then A must be false. These two statements are actually the contrapositive of each other. In logic, if a statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the second statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
