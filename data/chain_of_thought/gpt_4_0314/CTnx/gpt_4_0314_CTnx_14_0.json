So, the contrapositive would be: If the clug snugged, then the clug was not fleeked.\nSymbolically, this can be represented as: If S, then not F.\n\nNow, we can compare the contrapositive with the statement we want to infer:\n\"If the clug snugged, then the clug was not fleeked\" is the same as the contrapositive we found (If S, then not F).\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the given statement, we can infer the desired statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
