The contrapositive is formed by negating both the antecedent and the consequent and reversing their order.\n\nContrapositive: If the flug was zimmed, then the flug was not blummed.\nSymbolically, this can be represented as: If Z, then not B.\n\nThe contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we can infer the contrapositive from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
