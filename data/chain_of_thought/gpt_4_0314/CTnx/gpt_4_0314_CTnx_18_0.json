(where P = shank was plooked, Q = shank was nugged)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer the following statement:\nIf the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\nThis can be represented as: If Q, then not P.\n\nTo determine if we can infer this, let's look at the contrapositive of the given statement. The contrapositive is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then reversing their order. So, the contrapositive of the given statement would be: If not (not Q), then not P. Since not (not Q) is the same as Q, the contrapositive can be simplified to: If Q, then not P.\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the statement 'If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
