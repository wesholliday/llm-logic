(A = sprocket was cranked, B = sprocket was daggled)\n\nNow, we want to infer: If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\nThis can be represented as: If B, then not A.\n\nTo determine if we can infer this, let's look at the contrapositive of the given statement. The contrapositive is formed by negating both the antecedent and the consequent and reversing their order. So, the contrapositive of the given statement would be: If not (not B), then not A. Since not (not B) is the same as B, the contrapositive can be simplified to: If B, then not A.\n\nAs we can see, the contrapositive of the given statement is the same as the statement we want to infer. Therefore, we can infer the statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
