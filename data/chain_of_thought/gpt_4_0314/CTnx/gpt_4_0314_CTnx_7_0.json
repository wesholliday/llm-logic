(A = whiffle was shanked, B = whiffle tink)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer the following statement:\nIf the whiffle tink, then the whiffle was not shanked.\nThis can be represented as: If B, then not A.\n\nTo determine if we can infer this, let's look at the contrapositive of the given statement. The contrapositive is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and reversing their order. So, the contrapositive of the given statement would be: If not (not B), then not A. Since not (not B) is the same as B, the contrapositive can be simplified to: If B, then not A.\n\nAs we can see, the contrapositive of the given statement is the same as the statement we want to infer. Therefore, we can infer the statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
