(A = grommet was sploffed, B = grommet plopped the frink)\n\nNow, we want to infer: If the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\nThis can be represented as: If B, then not A.\n\nTo determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, we can use the concept of contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then reversing their order. \n\nThe contrapositive of the given statement (If A, then not B) would be: If B, then not A.\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
