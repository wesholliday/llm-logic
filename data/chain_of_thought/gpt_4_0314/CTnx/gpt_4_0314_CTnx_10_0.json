(where S represents 'sproinged' and G represents 'garpled')\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer the following statement:\nIf the wug was garpled, then the wug was not sproinged.\nThis can be represented as: If G, then not S.\n\nTo determine if we can infer this, let's look at the contrapositive of the given statement. The contrapositive is formed by negating both the antecedent and the consequent and reversing their order.\n\nContrapositive of the given statement: If not (not G), then not S.\nSimplifying the double negation: If G, then not S.\n\nAs we can see, the contrapositive of the given statement is the same as the statement we want to infer. Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the desired statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
