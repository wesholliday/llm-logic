(A = fleeg was bluttered, B = fleeg surned)\n\nNow, let's find the contrapositive of the given statement:\nIf B, then not A. (If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered)\n\nThe contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we can infer the contrapositive from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
