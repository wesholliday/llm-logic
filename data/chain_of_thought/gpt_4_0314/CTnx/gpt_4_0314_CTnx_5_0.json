The given statement tells us that if the zinger was fraggled, it was not smoogled. This means that if the zinger was smoogled, it could not have been fraggled, because if it was fraggled, it would not be smoogled.\n\nSo, we can infer that if the zinger was smoogled, it was not fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
