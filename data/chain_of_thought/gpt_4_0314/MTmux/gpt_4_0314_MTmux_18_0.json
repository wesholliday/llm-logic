If the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged.\nThis statement can be represented as: P \u2192 N (where P represents \"the shank was plooked\" and N represents \"the shank must have been nugged\")\n\n2. It's not the case that the shank must have been nugged.\nThis statement can be represented as: \u00acN (where \u00acN represents \"the shank must not have been nugged\")\n\nNow, we want to infer whether 'The shank was not plooked' is true or not. This statement can be represented as: \u00acP\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can apply Modus Tollens to the given statements:\n\nModus Tollens states that if P \u2192 N and \u00acN are true, then \u00acP must also be true.\n\nSince we have P \u2192 N and \u00acN, we can infer \u00acP.\n\nAnswer: yes",
