It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled.\nThis can be represented as: Not B.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The sprocket was not cranked' from these statements. In other words, we want to know if we can infer Not A.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite the first statement as: If not B, then not A. This means that if the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nSince the second statement tells us that the sprocket was not daggled (Not B), we can now infer that the sprocket was not cranked (Not A) based on the contrapositive of the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
