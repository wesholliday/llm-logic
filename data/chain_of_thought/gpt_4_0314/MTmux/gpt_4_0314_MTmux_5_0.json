It's not the case that the zinger must have been smoogled. (Not S)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer 'The zinger was not fraggled' (Not F) from these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 1 as:\n\n1a. If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled. (If Not S, then Not F)\n\nNow, we can see that statement 2 (Not S) matches the condition in statement 1a (If Not S). Therefore, we can infer the conclusion of statement 1a, which is 'The zinger was not fraggled' (Not F).\n\nAnswer: yes",
