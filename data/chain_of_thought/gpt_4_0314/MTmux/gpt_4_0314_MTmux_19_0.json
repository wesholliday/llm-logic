If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged.\nThis statement can be represented as: If V, then P (where V represents \"smonk was vreebled\" and P represents \"smonk must have plagged\").\n\n2. It's not the case that the smonk must have plagged.\nThis statement can be represented as: not P.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The smonk was not vreebled' from these two statements. In other words, we want to know if we can infer not V.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite the first statement as: If not P, then not V. Since we know that not P is true (from the second statement), we can infer not V.\n\nAnswer: yes",
