It's not the case that the smip must have lupped the zoint.\n\nWe want to know if we can infer \"The smip was not shripped\" from these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive, we can rephrase statement 1 as:\n\n1a. If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped.\n\nNow, let's compare statement 1a with statement 2:\n\n1a. If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped.\n2. It's not the case that the smip must have lupped the zoint.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it's not necessary for the smip to have lupped the zoint. However, it doesn't tell us whether the smip actually lupped the zoint or not. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The smip was not shripped\" from these statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
