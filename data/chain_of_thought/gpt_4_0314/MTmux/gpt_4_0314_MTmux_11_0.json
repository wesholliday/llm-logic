If the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed.\nThis can be represented as: If B, then Z (where B represents \"flug was blummed\" and Z represents \"flug must have been zimmed\").\n\n2. It's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed.\nThis can be represented as: Not Z.\n\nNow, we want to infer if 'The flug was not blummed' (Not B) is true based on the given statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 1 as: If not Z, then not B.\n\nSince statement 2 is given as Not Z, we can substitute it into the contrapositive of statement 1:\n\nIf Not Z, then Not B.\n\nSo, based on the given statements, we can infer that 'The flug was not blummed' (Not B) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
