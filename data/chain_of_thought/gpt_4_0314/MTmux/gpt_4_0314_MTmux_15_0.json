If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened.\nThis statement can be represented as: If A, then B. (A = dreb was vroombed, B = dreb must have been spened)\n\n2. It's not the case that the dreb must have been spened.\nThis statement can be represented as: Not B.\n\nNow, we want to infer if 'The dreb was not vroombed' is true, which can be represented as: Not A.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can apply the contrapositive rule to statement 1. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" So, the contrapositive of statement 1 is: If not B, then not A.\n\nSince statement 2 is \"Not B,\" we can now apply the contrapositive rule: If not B, then not A. In this case, \"Not A\" means \"The dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
