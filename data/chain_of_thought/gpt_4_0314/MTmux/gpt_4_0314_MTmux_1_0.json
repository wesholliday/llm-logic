If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled.\nThis statement can be represented as: If A, then B.\n\n2. It's not the case that the flugel must have been zargled.\nThis statement can be represented as: Not B.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The flugel was not blimmed' from these two statements. In other words, we want to know if we can infer Not A.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can apply the contrapositive rule to statement 1. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" So, we have:\n\n3. If not B, then not A.\n\nNow, we can see that statement 2 (Not B) matches the condition in statement 3 (If not B). Therefore, we can infer the conclusion of statement 3, which is Not A.\n\nSo, we can infer 'The flugel was not blimmed' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
