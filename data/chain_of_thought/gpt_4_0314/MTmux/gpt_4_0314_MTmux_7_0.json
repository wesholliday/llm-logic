It's not the case that the whiffle must have tinked.\nThis statement can be represented as: Not B.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The whiffle was not shanked' from these statements, which can be represented as: Not A.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite the first statement as: If not B, then not A. This matches the given statements, so we can infer 'The whiffle was not shanked' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
