It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink.\n\nWe can represent these statements using logical notation:\n\n1. P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\n2. \u00acQ (Not Q)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \u00acP (The sneg was not crampled) from these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we know that if P \u2192 Q is true, then \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP is also true. In other words, if \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink\" is true, then \"If it's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled\" is also true.\n\nSince we are given that P \u2192 Q is true and \u00acQ is true, we can infer \u00acP.\n\nAnswer: yes",
