If the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint.\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A, then B. In this case, A is \"the wug was flooped\" and B is \"the wug must have bimmed the zoint.\"\n\n2. It's not the case that the wug must have bimmed the zoint.\nThis statement is a negation of B, which can be represented as: not B.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The wug was not flooped' from these statements. In other words, we want to know if we can infer not A.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite the first statement as: If not B, then not A. This means that if it's not the case that the wug must have bimmed the zoint, then the wug was not flooped.\n\nSince the second statement is not B, we can now infer not A, which is 'The wug was not flooped.'\n\nAnswer: yes",
