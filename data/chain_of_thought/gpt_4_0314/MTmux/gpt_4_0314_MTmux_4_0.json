If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked.\nThis statement can be represented as: If A, then B (where A is \"the fribble was snurgled\" and B is \"the fribble must have crinked\").\n\n2. It's not the case that the fribble must have crinked.\nThis statement can be represented as: Not B (where B is \"the fribble must have crinked\").\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The fribble was not snurgled' from these two statements. In other words, we want to know if we can infer Not A (where A is \"the fribble was snurgled\").\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite the first statement as: If not B, then not A. This means that if the fribble did not crink, then it was not snurgled.\n\nSince the second statement tells us that the fribble did not crink (Not B), we can now apply the contrapositive rule and infer that the fribble was not snurgled (Not A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
