If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink.\nThis statement can be represented as: If A, then B.\n\n2. It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink.\nThis statement can be represented as: Not B.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The grommet was not sploffed' (Not A) from these two statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite the first statement as: If not B, then not A. This means that if the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nSince the second statement is 'Not B', we can now apply the contrapositive rule and infer 'Not A', which is 'The grommet was not sploffed'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
