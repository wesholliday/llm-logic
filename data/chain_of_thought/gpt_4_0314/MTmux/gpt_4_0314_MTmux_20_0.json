If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\nThis statement can be represented as: If A, then B. (A = fleeg was bluttered, B = fleeg must have been surned)\n\n2. It's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned.\nThis statement can be represented as: Not B.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The fleeg was not bluttered' from these two statements. In other words, we want to know if we can infer Not A.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite the first statement as: If not B, then not A. This means that if the fleeg must not have been surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nSince the second statement is Not B, we can now infer Not A, which is 'The fleeg was not bluttered'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
