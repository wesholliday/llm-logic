If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged.\nThis statement can be represented as: If A, then B.\n\n2. It's not the case that the clug must have been snugged.\nThis statement can be represented as: Not B.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The clug was not fleeked' from these statements, which can be represented as: Not A.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can apply the contrapositive rule to statement 1. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, it would be: If the clug was not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked.\n\nSince statement 2 is \"Not B,\" we can now apply the contrapositive rule: If not B (the clug was not snugged), then not A (the clug was not fleeked).\n\nAnswer: yes",
