If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated.\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A (the flob was skizzled), then B (the flob must have movated).\n\n2. It's not the case that the flob must have movated.\nThis statement negates the consequent of the conditional statement, which can be represented as: not B (the flob must not have movated).\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The flob was not skizzled' from these two statements. In other words, we want to know if not A (the flob was not skizzled) follows from the given statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite the conditional statement as: If not B (the flob must not have movated), then not A (the flob was not skizzled).\n\nSince we are given that not B is true (the flob must not have movated), we can infer that not A is also true (the flob was not skizzled) based on the contrapositive rule.\n\nAnswer: yes",
