If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished.\nThis statement can be represented as: If P (plinked), then V (varnished).\n\n2. It's not the case that the twonk must have been varnished.\nThis statement can be represented as: Not necessarily V (varnished).\n\nNow, we want to infer whether 'The twonk was not plinked' is true or not.\n\nIf we assume that the twonk was plinked (P), then according to the first statement, it must have been varnished (V). However, the second statement tells us that it's not necessarily the case that the twonk was varnished. This means that there is a possibility that the twonk was not varnished, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the twonk was not plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
