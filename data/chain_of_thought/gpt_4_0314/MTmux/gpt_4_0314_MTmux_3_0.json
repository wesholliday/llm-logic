(Not B)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The splat was not morphed' (Not A) from these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 1 as:\n\n1. If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed. (If not B, then not A)\n\nSince statement 2 is 'Not B', we can now use statement 1 to infer 'Not A':\n\nIf not B (It's not the case that the splat must have quanked), then not A (The splat was not morphed).\n\nAnswer: yes",
