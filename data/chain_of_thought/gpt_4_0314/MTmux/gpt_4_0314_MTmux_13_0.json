(Not B)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer 'The glip was not slogged' (Not A) from these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 1 as:\n\n1. If the glip did not tragg, then the glip was not slogged. (If not B, then not A)\n\nNow, we can see that statement 2 is the same as the first part of the contrapositive (Not B). Therefore, we can infer the second part of the contrapositive (Not A), which is 'The glip was not slogged'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
