It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\n\nFrom statement 1, we have two possibilities: the pen is on the desk or the pen is in the bag. Statement 2 tells us that the pen is not on the desk. Since we only have two possibilities and one of them is ruled out, we can infer that the pen must be in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
