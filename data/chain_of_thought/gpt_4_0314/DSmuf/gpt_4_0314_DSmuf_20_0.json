It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\n\nFrom statement 1, we have two possibilities: sunglasses on her head (A) or sunglasses in her bag (B). This can be represented as A or B.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head, which means A is false.\n\nSince A is false and we have A or B, the only remaining possibility is B.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
