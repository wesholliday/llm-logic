It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are two possibilities: the cat is playing in the bedroom or napping on the couch. Statement 2 tells us that the cat is not playing in the bedroom. Since the cat is not playing in the bedroom, the only remaining possibility is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
