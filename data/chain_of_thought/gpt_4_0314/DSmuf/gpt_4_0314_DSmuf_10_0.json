It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two options must be true. In this case, either the sock is under the bed or it's in the laundry basket.\n\nStatement 2 negates the first option, meaning that the missing sock must not be under the bed.\n\nSince the first option is negated and we know that at least one of the options must be true, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
