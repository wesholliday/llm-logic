It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two options must be true. The second statement negates the first option, which is that the book must be resting on the table.\n\nSince the first option is negated, and we know that at least one of the options must be true, we can infer that the second option, \"the book is on the shelf,\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
