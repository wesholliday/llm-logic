It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nThe first statement presents two possibilities: the toy is on the bookshelf or in the toy box. The second statement eliminates the possibility of the toy being on the bookshelf. Since there are only two possibilities presented in the first statement, and one of them has been eliminated, we can infer that the remaining possibility must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
