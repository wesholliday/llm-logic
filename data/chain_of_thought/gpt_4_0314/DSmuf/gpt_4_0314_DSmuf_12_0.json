It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\n\nFrom statement 1, we have two possibilities: the jacket is in the closet or it is on the chair. Since statement 2 tells us that it's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet, we can eliminate that possibility. \n\nNow, we are left with only one possibility: the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
