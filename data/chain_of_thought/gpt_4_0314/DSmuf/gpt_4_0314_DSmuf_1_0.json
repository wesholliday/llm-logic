It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two parts must be true. In this case, either Fido must be in the garden, or Fido is inside.\n\nStatement 2 negates the first part of the disjunction, meaning that Fido doesn't have to be in the garden.\n\nSince the disjunction in Statement 1 requires at least one of the parts to be true, and we know from Statement 2 that the first part is not true, we can infer that the second part must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
