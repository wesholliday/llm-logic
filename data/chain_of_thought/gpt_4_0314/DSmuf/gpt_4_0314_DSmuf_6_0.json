It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen.\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two parts must be true. The second statement negates the first part of the disjunction, which is that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen.\n\nSince the first part of the disjunction is false, the only remaining possibility for the disjunction to be true is that the second part is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes",
