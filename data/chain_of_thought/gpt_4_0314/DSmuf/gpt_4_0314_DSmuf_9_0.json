It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two options must be true. In this case, either the puzzle piece is blending in on the floor, or it is in the box.\n\nStatement 2 negates the first option, meaning that the puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor.\n\nSince we know that at least one of the options must be true, and we have eliminated the first option, we can infer that the second option must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
