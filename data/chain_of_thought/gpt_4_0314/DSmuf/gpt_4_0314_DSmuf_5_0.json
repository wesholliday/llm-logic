It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two options must be true: either the cookies are hidden in the pantry, or they are in the jar.\n\nStatement 2 negates the first option, meaning that the cookies are not necessarily hidden in the pantry.\n\nSince the first option is negated, and we know that at least one of the options must be true, we can infer that the second option must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
