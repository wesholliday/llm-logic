It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\n\nFrom statement 1, we have two possibilities: the notebook is on the nightstand or it is in the drawer. Statement 2 tells us that the notebook is not on the nightstand. Since we only have two possibilities and one of them is ruled out, we can infer that the notebook must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
