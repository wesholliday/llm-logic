It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two options must be true. The second statement negates the first option, which is that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\n\nSince the first option is negated, and we know that at least one of the options must be true, we can infer that the second option, \"The milk is on the counter,\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
