It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\n\nThe first statement presents two possibilities: the remote control is either under the couch or on the coffee table. The second statement eliminates the possibility of the remote control being under the couch. Since there are only two possibilities presented in the first statement, and one of them has been eliminated, we can infer that the remaining possibility must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
