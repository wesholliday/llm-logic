If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\nThis is a conditional statement: If A (vampire was awake), then B (mummy must have been awake).\n\nNow, we want to infer if 'The vampire was not awake' from these statements.\n\nSince we know that the mummy might not have been awake (from statement 1), and the conditional statement (from statement 2) tells us that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake, we can conclude that the vampire was not awake. If the vampire were awake, it would contradict the fact that the mummy might not have been awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
