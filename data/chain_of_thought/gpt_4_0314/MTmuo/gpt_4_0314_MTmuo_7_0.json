It's possible that Chris did not finish the race.\n\n2. If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\nThis statement establishes a condition: if Alex finished the race, then it's certain that Chris also finished the race.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that Alex finished the race. If that were true, then according to statement 2, Chris must have finished the race. However, this contradicts statement 1, which says that we cannot be certain that Chris finished the race.\n\nSince assuming that Alex finished the race leads to a contradiction, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
