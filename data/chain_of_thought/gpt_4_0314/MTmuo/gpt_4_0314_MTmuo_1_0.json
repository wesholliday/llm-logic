If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\nThis is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If M (Mary was at the wedding), then S (Sue must have been at the wedding).\n\nNow, we want to infer whether Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nIf we assume that Mary was at the wedding (M is true), then according to the second statement, Sue must have been at the wedding (S is true). However, this contradicts the first statement, which says that Sue might not have been at the wedding.\n\nSince assuming Mary was at the wedding leads to a contradiction, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
