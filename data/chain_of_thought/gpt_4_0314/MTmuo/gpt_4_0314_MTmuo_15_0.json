It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\nThis means that Erin taking a train is not a necessity, or in other words, there is a possibility that Erin did not take a train.\n\n2. If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\nThis is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If P (Sam took a plane), then Q (Erin took a train).\n\nNow, we want to infer if 'Sam did not take a plane' from these statements.\n\nIf we assume that Sam took a plane (P is true), then according to the conditional statement, Erin must have taken a train (Q is true). However, this contradicts the first statement, which says that Erin taking a train is not a necessity.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
