It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\nThis means that the unicorn might not have been in the forest.\n\n2. If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\nThis is a conditional statement: If A (griffin in the forest), then B (unicorn in the forest).\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nSince we know that the unicorn might not have been in the forest, and the conditional statement tells us that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest. If the griffin were in the forest, it would contradict the first statement, as the unicorn would have to be in the forest as well.\n\nAnswer: yes",
