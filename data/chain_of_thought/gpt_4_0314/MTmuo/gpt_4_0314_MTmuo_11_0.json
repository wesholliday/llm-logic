It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\nThis means that the muffins could be something other than blueberry.\n\n2. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\nThis is a conditional statement: If A (cake was chocolate), then B (muffins were blueberry).\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: Can we infer 'The cake was not chocolate'?\n\nIf the cake was chocolate (A), then the muffins must have been blueberry (B). However, we know from statement 1 that the muffins could be something other than blueberry. This means that the condition (A) cannot be true, because if it were, it would lead to a contradiction with statement 1.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the cake was not chocolate. \n\nAnswer: yes",
