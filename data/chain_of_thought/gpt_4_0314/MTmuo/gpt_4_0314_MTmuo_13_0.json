            "content": "Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\nThis means that the truck is not necessarily blue. It could be blue, but it could also be another color.\n\n2. If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\nThis is a conditional statement. If the condition (the car being red) is true, then the consequence (the truck being blue) must also be true.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The car is red.\nAccording to statement 2, if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. However, this contradicts statement 1, which says that the truck is not necessarily blue. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\nScenario 2: The car is not red.\nIn this case, statement 2 does not apply, as the condition (the car being red) is not true. This means that the truck's color is not restricted, and statement 1 holds true.\n\nSince the only possible scenario is the one where the car is not red, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
