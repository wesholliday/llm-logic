If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\nThis is a conditional statement: If A (alien visited Mars), then B (robot visited Jupiter).\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: Can we infer 'The alien did not visit Mars'?\n\nIf the robot did not necessarily visit Jupiter, it means that the condition B is false. In a conditional statement, if the consequent (B) is false, then the antecedent (A) must also be false for the statement to hold true. In this case, A is 'The alien visited Mars'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
