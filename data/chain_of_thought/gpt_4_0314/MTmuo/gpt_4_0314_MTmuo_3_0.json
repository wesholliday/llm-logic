If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\nThis is a conditional statement: If A (the book was written by James), then B (the book must be a mystery novel).\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that the book was not written by James (\u00acA) from these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 2 as: If \u00acB (the book is not a mystery novel), then \u00acA (the book was not written by James).\n\nHowever, statement 1 only tells us that the book might or might not be a mystery novel, which means we cannot definitively say that the book is not a mystery novel (\u00acB). Therefore, we cannot infer that the book was not written by James (\u00acA) based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
