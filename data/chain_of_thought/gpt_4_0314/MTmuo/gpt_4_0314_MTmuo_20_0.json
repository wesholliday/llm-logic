If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\nThis is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A (apple was red), then B (banana must have been yellow).\n\nNow, we want to infer if 'The apple was not red' from these statements.\n\nIf the banana must have been yellow (B) is false, as given in statement 1, then according to the conditional statement (If A, then B), the apple being red (A) must also be false. This is because if A were true, then B would have to be true as well, which contradicts statement 1.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
