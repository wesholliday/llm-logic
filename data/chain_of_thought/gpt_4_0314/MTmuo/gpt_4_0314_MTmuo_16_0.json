If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\nThis is a conditional statement: If A (shirt was cotton), then B (pants must have been denim).\n\nNow, we want to infer if 'The shirt was not cotton' is true.\n\nIf the shirt was cotton (A is true), then according to statement 2, the pants must have been denim (B is true). However, statement 1 tells us that it's not the case that the pants must have been denim. This means that the shirt being cotton would lead to a contradiction.\n\nSince the shirt being cotton leads to a contradiction, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
