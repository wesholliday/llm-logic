It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\nThis means that there is a possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\n2. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\nThis is a conditional statement that tells us that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then it is certain that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: Can we infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt'?\n\nIf we assume that Lisa bought the red shirt, then according to statement 2, Mark must have bought the blue shirt. However, this contradicts statement 1, which says that it's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. Therefore, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt to avoid this contradiction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
