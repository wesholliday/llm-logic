If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\nThis is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If S (Sue chose pizza), then B (Bob chose pasta).\n\nNow, we want to infer if 'Sue did not choose pizza' from these statements.\n\nIf Sue chose pizza (S), then according to statement 2, Bob must have chosen pasta (B). However, statement 1 tells us that it's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta. This means that there is a possibility that Bob did not choose pasta, which contradicts the condition in statement 2.\n\nSince the condition in statement 2 cannot be true (because of the contradiction), we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
