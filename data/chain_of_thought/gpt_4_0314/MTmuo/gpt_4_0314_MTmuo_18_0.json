If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\nThis is a conditional statement: If A (doll is plastic), then B (truck is metal).\n\nNow, we want to infer if 'The doll was not plastic' is true.\n\nIf we assume the doll was plastic (A is true), then according to the second statement, the truck must have been metal (B is true). However, this contradicts the first statement, which says that the truck being metal is not a necessary condition.\n\nSince assuming the doll was plastic leads to a contradiction, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
