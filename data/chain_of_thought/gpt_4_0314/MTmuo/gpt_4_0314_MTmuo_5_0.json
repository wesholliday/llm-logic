If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\nThis is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If J, then A.\n\nNow, we want to infer if 'Jeff did not play basketball' from these statements.\n\nIf we assume that Jeff played basketball (J), then according to the second statement, Amy must have played tennis (A). However, this contradicts the first statement, which says that Amy might not have played tennis.\n\nSince assuming Jeff played basketball leads to a contradiction, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
