It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\nThis means that there is a possibility that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\n2. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\nThis is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Joe went to the park) is true, then the second part (Lucy must have gone to the zoo) must also be true.\n\nNow, let's try to infer whether Joe did not go to the park.\n\nIf Joe went to the park, then according to statement 2, Lucy must have gone to the zoo. However, statement 1 tells us that it's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This means that the condition in statement 2 (Joe went to the park) cannot be true, because if it were true, it would contradict statement 1.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
