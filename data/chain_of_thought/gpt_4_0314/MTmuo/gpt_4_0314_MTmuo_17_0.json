We cannot be certain that she ate salad.\n\n2. If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\nThis is a conditional statement. It tells us that if Ben ate pasta, then it is certain that Kate ate salad.\n\nNow, let's try to infer if Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nIf Ben ate pasta, then according to statement 2, Kate must have eaten salad. However, statement 1 tells us that it's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad. This means that the condition for statement 2 (Ben ate pasta) cannot be true, because if it were true, it would contradict statement 1.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
