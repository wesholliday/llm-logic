We cannot say for sure.\n\n2. If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\nThis is a conditional statement. If the first part (Tom watched football) is true, then the second part (Jen must have watched basketball) must also be true.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that Tom watched football. If that were true, then according to the second statement, Jen must have watched basketball. However, this contradicts the first statement, which says that it's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nSince the given statements cannot both be true if Tom watched football, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
