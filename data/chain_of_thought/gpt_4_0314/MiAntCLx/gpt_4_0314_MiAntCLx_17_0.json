In this case, we are given the statement \"The blimp might be zooble.\" We are asked to infer if \"The blimp might be zooble and be blurble by froodle\" from the given statement. The given statement only provides information about the possibility of the blimp being zooble, but it does not provide any information about the blimp being blurble by froodle. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
