In this case, we are given the statement \"The wumble might be plonk flump\" and asked if we can infer \"The wumble might be plonk flump and snork zibber quank.\" Since the second part of the statement, \"snork zibber quank,\" is not mentioned or implied in the original statement, we cannot infer it based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
