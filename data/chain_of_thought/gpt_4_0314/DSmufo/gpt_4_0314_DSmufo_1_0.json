In other words, there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden.\n\n2. Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: Fido is in the garden, or Fido is inside. Since these are the only two options given, at least one of them must be true.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\nSince statement 1 tells us that Fido is not necessarily in the garden, and statement 2 tells us that if Fido is not in the garden, then Fido must be inside, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
