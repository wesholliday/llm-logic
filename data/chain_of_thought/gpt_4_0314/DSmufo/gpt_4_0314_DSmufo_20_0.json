Either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the sunglasses are on her head OR they are in her bag.\n\nNow, we know from statement 1 that the sunglasses are NOT on her head. Since statement 2 presents only two possibilities, and we have eliminated one of them (sunglasses on her head), the only remaining possibility is that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
