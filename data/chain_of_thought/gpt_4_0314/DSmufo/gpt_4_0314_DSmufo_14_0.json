It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\nThis statement is a negation, meaning that the milk is not necessarily in the fridge.\n\n2. Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter.\nThis statement is a disjunction, meaning that one of the two options must be true: either the milk is in the fridge or it is on the counter.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\nSince statement 1 tells us that the milk is not necessarily in the fridge, and statement 2 tells us that either the milk is in the fridge or on the counter, we can infer that the milk must be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
