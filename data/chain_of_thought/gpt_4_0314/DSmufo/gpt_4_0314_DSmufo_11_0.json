It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch.\nThis statement implies that the newspaper is NOT on the porch.\n\n2. Either the newspaper must be sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the newspaper is on the porch OR the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from both statements:\n\nSince statement 1 tells us that the newspaper is NOT on the porch, and statement 2 gives us only two possibilities (on the porch or in the driveway), we can infer that the newspaper must be in the driveway, as it is the only remaining option.\n\nAnswer: yes",
