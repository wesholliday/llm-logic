It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\nThis statement implies that the book is not necessarily on the table. It could be somewhere else, but we don't know for sure.\n\n2. Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the book is on the table, or it is on the shelf. At least one of these must be true.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\nSince statement 1 tells us that the book is not necessarily on the table, and statement 2 tells us that either the book is on the table or on the shelf, we can infer that the book must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
