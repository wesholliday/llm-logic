It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\nThis statement is a negation, meaning the keys are NOT dangling in the cabinet.\n\n2. Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer.\nThis statement is a disjunction, meaning one of the two options must be true: either the keys are dangling in the cabinet, or they are in the drawer.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from both statements. Since we know from statement 1 that the keys are NOT dangling in the cabinet, and statement 2 tells us that one of the two options must be true, we can infer that the keys must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
