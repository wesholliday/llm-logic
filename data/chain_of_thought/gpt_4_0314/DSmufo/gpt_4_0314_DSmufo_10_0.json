It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\nThis statement implies that the missing sock is NOT under the bed.\n\n2. Either the missing sock must be under the bed or it's in the laundry basket.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the sock is under the bed OR the sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from both statements:\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that the missing sock is NOT under the bed, and statement 2 tells us that it must be either under the bed or in the laundry basket, the only remaining possibility is that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
