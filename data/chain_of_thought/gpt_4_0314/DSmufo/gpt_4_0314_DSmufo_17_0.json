It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\nThis means that the scarf is not necessarily on the coat rack.\n\n2. Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack.\nThis means that there are only two possibilities: the scarf is on the coat rack or it is in the backpack.\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that the scarf is not necessarily on the coat rack, and statement 2 tells us that there are only two possibilities, we can infer that the scarf must be in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
