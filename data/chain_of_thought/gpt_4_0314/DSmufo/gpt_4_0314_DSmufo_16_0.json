It could be somewhere else, but we don't know for sure.\n\n2. Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the pen is on the desk, or the pen is in the bag. At least one of these must be true.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\nSince statement 1 tells us that the pen is not necessarily on the desk, and statement 2 tells us that either the pen is on the desk or in the bag, we can infer that the pen must be in the bag because the other option (the pen being on the desk) is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
