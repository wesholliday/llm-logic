Either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser.\nThis means that one of these two options must be true: the watch is on his wrist, or the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nNow, we know from statement 1 that the watch is not necessarily on his wrist. Since statement 2 tells us that one of the two options must be true, and we know that the watch is not necessarily on his wrist, we can infer that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
