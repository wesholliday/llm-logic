It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom.\nThis statement implies that the cat is not necessarily playing in the bedroom. It doesn't mean that the cat is definitely not playing in the bedroom, just that it's not a requirement.\n\n2. Either the cat must be playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the cat is playing in the bedroom, or it's napping on the couch. At least one of these must be true.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\nSince it's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom (statement 1), and either the cat must be playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch (statement 2), we can infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
