It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\nThis statement implies that the toy is not necessarily on the bookshelf. It could be somewhere else.\n\n2. Either the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the toy is on the bookshelf, or the toy is in the toy box.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements. Since statement 1 tells us that the toy is not necessarily on the bookshelf, and statement 2 gives us only two possibilities (bookshelf or toy box), we can infer that the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
