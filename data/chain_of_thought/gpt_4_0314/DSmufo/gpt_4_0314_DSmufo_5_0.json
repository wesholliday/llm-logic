It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\nThis means that the cookies are not necessarily in the pantry.\n\n2. Either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the cookies are in the pantry or they are in the jar.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\nSince statement 1 tells us that the cookies are not necessarily in the pantry, and statement 2 gives us only two possibilities (pantry or jar), we can infer that the cookies must be in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
