Symbolically, this is represented as: If not J, then not A.\n\nComparing the contrapositive (If not A, then not J) with the statement we want to infer (If not J, then not A), we can see that they are not the same. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\n\nAnswer: no",
