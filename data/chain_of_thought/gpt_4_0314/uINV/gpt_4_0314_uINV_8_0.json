However, the question asks if we can infer that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake. This statement is different from the contrapositive.\n\nThe statement in question: If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\nSymbolically, this can be represented as: ~V -> ~M\n\nThis statement is not logically equivalent to the given statement or its contrapositive. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
