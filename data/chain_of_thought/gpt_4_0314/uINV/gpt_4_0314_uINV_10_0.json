This statement can be represented as: If A (dog inside), then B (cat outside).\n3. We are asked to infer if the following statement is true: \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside.\"\n4. This new statement can be represented as: If not A (dog not inside), then not B (cat not outside).\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship between these statements:\n\nThe original statement (If A, then B) does not provide any information about what happens when A is false (dog not inside). It only tells us the situation when the dog is inside. Therefore, we cannot infer the truth of the new statement (If not A, then not B) based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
