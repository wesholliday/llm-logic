            "content": "Let's analyze the statement and its contrapositive.\n\nThe given statement is: If the apple was red (A), then the banana was yellow (B). Symbolically, this can be represented as A \u2192 B.\n\nNow, let's find the contrapositive of this statement. The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then reversing their order. So, the contrapositive of A \u2192 B is \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA, which means: If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\n\nHowever, the question asks if we can infer that if the apple was not red (\u00acA), then the banana was not yellow (\u00acB). This is not the contrapositive of the given statement. Instead, it is the inverse of the given statement, which is represented as \u00acA \u2192 \u00acB.\n\nThe truth of the contrapositive is always equivalent to the truth of the original statement. However, the truth of the inverse is not necessarily equivalent to the truth of the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
