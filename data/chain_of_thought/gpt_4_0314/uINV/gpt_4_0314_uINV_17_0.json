However, the question asks if we can infer that if Ben did not eat pasta (~P), then Kate did not eat salad (~Q). This is the inverse of the original statement and can be represented as: ~P \u2192 ~Q\n\nThe inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement or its contrapositive. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad.\n\nAnswer: no",
