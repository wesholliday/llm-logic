This can be represented as: If not A (Tom did not watch football), then not B (Jen did not watch basketball).\n\nThe given statement does not provide any information about what happens when Tom does not watch football. It only tells us what happens when Tom watches football. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about Jen's actions when Tom does not watch football.\n\nAnswer: no",
