So, the contrapositive of the given statement would be: If not W, then not B.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer: If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den. Symbolically, this can be written as: If not B, then not W.\n\nComparing the contrapositive (If not W, then not B) with the statement we want to infer (If not B, then not W), we can see that they are not the same. Therefore, we cannot infer the given statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
