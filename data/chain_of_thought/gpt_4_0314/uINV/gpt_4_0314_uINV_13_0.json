This statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If P, then Q. In this case, P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\"\n3. We are asked to determine if we can infer the statement: \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\"\n4. This new statement can be represented as: If not P, then not Q. In this case, not P is \"the car was not red\" and not Q is \"the truck was not blue.\"\n5. The original statement (If P, then Q) does not provide enough information to determine the truth of the new statement (If not P, then not Q). We only know what happens when the car is red, but we don't know what happens when the car is not red.\n\nAnswer: no",
