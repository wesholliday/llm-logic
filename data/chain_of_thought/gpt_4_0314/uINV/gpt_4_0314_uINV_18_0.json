In this case, P represents \"the doll was plastic\" and Q represents \"the truck was metal.\"\n\nNow, we are asked if we can infer the following statement: If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal. This statement can be represented as: If not P, then not Q.\n\nTo determine if we can infer this new statement from the original statement, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe original statement (If P, then Q) tells us that if the doll is plastic, the truck must be metal. However, it does not provide any information about what happens when the doll is not plastic. It is possible that the truck could still be metal even if the doll is not plastic.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the new statement (If not P, then not Q) from the original statement (If P, then Q).\n\nAnswer: no",
