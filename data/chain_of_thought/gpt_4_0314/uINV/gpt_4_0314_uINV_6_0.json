However, the contrapositive is not the same as the statement we are trying to infer: If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta (If not P, then not Q).\n\nSince the contrapositive is not the same as the statement we are trying to infer, we cannot conclude that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: no",
