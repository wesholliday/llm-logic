However, it does not provide any information about what happens if Mary is not at the wedding.\n\nWe cannot infer that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding, because the given statement does not provide any information about Sue's presence or absence when Mary is not at the wedding. It is possible that Sue could still attend the wedding even if Mary does not.\n\nAnswer: no",
