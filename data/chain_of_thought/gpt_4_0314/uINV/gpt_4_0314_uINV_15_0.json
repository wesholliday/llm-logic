This can be represented as P \u2192 T, where P represents Sam taking a plane and T represents Erin taking a train.\n\nNow, we are asked if we can infer that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train. This can be represented as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acT, where \u00acP represents Sam not taking a plane and \u00acT represents Erin not taking a train.\n\nThe given statement (P \u2192 T) does not provide enough information to infer the new statement (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acT). The original statement only tells us what happens when Sam takes a plane, but it does not tell us anything about what happens when Sam does not take a plane. It is possible that Erin could still take a train even if Sam does not take a plane.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\n\nAnswer: no",
