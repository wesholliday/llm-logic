This new statement can be represented as \"If not A, then not B\" or \"\u00acA \u2192 \u00acB\".\n\nTo determine if we can infer this new statement from the original statement, we need to see if the contrapositive of the original statement is true. The contrapositive of a statement \"A \u2192 B\" is \"\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA\". In this case, the contrapositive would be \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\"\n\nHowever, the contrapositive does not help us infer the new statement \"\u00acA \u2192 \u00acB\". The original statement only tells us what happens when the cake is chocolate, but it does not provide any information about what happens when the cake is not chocolate. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nAnswer: no",
