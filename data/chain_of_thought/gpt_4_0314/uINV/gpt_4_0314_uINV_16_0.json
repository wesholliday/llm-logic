This can be written as A \u2192 B.\n\nNow, let's find the contrapositive of this statement. The contrapositive of a statement A \u2192 B is \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA, where \u00ac represents negation. In this case, the contrapositive would be: If the pants were not denim (\u00acB), then the shirt was not cotton (\u00acA).\n\nHowever, the question asks if we can infer that if the shirt was not cotton (\u00acA), then the pants were not denim (\u00acB). This is a different statement, \u00acA \u2192 \u00acB, which is not the contrapositive of the given statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
