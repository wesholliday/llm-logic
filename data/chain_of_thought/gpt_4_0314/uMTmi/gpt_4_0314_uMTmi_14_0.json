If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A (bear in the cave), then B (wolf in the den).\n\n2. The wolf might not have been in the den.\nThis statement tells us that it's possible that B (wolf in the den) is false.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that A (bear in the cave) is false based on this information.\n\nIn a conditional statement, if A is true, then B must be true. However, if B is false, we cannot definitively say whether A is true or false. In this case, we know that B might be false, but we don't have enough information to determine the truth value of A.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the bear was not in the cave based on the given information. \n\nAnswer: no",
