Lucy might not have gone to the zoo.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Joe went to the park, Lucy definitely went to the zoo. However, statement 2 tells us that there is a possibility that Lucy did not go to the zoo. If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then it contradicts the condition in statement 1, which means Joe could not have gone to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
