Bob might not have chosen pasta.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Sue chose pizza, it is certain that Bob chose pasta. However, statement 2 tells us that it is not certain that Bob chose pasta, meaning there is a possibility that he chose something else.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer that Sue did not choose pizza?\n\nIf we assume that Sue chose pizza, then according to statement 1, Bob must have chosen pasta. But statement 2 tells us that Bob might not have chosen pasta. This creates a contradiction, which means our assumption that Sue chose pizza is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
