The pants might not have been denim.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that there is a possibility that the pants were not denim. However, this statement does not provide any definitive information about whether the pants were actually denim or not.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 1. It tells us that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. But it does not tell us what happens if the shirt was not cotton. \n\nGiven the information we have, we cannot definitively infer that the shirt was not cotton. There is still a possibility that the shirt was cotton and the pants were denim, as stated in statement 1.\n\nAnswer: no",
