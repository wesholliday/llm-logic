The book might not be a mystery novel.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that all books written by James are mystery novels. However, statement 2 only tells us that there is a possibility that the book is not a mystery novel, but it does not confirm that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nSince we do not have enough information to confirm that the book is not a mystery novel, we cannot infer that the book was not written by James. \n\nAnswer: no",
