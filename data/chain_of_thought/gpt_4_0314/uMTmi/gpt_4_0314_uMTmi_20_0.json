The banana might not have been yellow.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the apple was red, the banana would definitely be yellow. However, statement 2 tells us that the banana might not have been yellow, which means there is a possibility that the apple was not red.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively conclude that the apple was not red, because statement 2 only tells us that the banana might not have been yellow, not that it definitely wasn't yellow. There is still a possibility that the banana was yellow and the apple was red.\n\nSo, we cannot infer that the apple was not red with certainty. \n\nAnswer: no",
