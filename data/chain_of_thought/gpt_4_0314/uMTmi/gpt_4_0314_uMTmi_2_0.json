If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\nThis statement tells us that if the griffin is in the forest, the unicorn is also there. However, it doesn't tell us anything about the griffin's location if the unicorn is not in the forest.\n\n2. The unicorn might not have been in the forest.\nThis statement tells us that there is a possibility that the unicorn was not in the forest. However, it doesn't give us any information about the griffin's location.\n\nBased on these two statements, we cannot infer the griffin's location. We only know that if the griffin was in the forest, the unicorn would also be there. But since we don't have any information about the griffin's location when the unicorn is not in the forest, we cannot conclude that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no",
