Kate might not have eaten salad.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta. However, statement 2 only tells us that it's possible that Kate did not eat salad, not that she definitely didn't eat salad.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to confirm whether Kate ate salad or not, we cannot definitively infer that Ben did not eat pasta. \n\nAnswer: no",
