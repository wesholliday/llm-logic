The muffins might not have been blueberry.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the cake was chocolate, the muffins could not be anything other than blueberry. However, statement 2 tells us that there is a possibility that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nIf the muffins were not blueberry, then according to statement 1, the cake could not have been chocolate. But we don't have enough information to confirm whether the muffins were indeed not blueberry.\n\nSo, we cannot definitively infer that the cake was not chocolate based on the given information. \n\nAnswer: no",
