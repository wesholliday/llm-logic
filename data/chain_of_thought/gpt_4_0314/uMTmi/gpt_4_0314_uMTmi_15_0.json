Erin might not have taken a train.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Sam took a plane, Erin definitely took a train. However, statement 2 tells us that there is a possibility that Erin did not take a train. \n\nIf Erin did not take a train, then it contradicts the condition in statement 1, which means Sam could not have taken a plane. Therefore, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
