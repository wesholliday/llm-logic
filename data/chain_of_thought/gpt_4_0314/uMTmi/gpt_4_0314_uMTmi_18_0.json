The truck might not have been metal.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the doll is plastic, the truck is definitely metal. However, statement 2 tells us that the truck might not have been metal, which means there is a possibility that the truck is not metal.\n\nNow, let's consider the contrapositive of statement 1:\n\n1a. If the truck is not metal, then the doll is not plastic.\n\nSince statement 2 tells us that there is a possibility that the truck is not metal, and statement 1a tells us that if the truck is not metal, then the doll is not plastic, we can infer that there is a possibility that the doll is not plastic.\n\nHowever, this does not definitively prove that the doll was not plastic. It only shows that there is a possibility that the doll is not plastic.\n\nAnswer: no",
