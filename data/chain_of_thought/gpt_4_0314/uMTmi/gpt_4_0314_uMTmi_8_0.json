If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\nThis statement tells us that if the vampire is awake, it is guaranteed that the mummy is also awake. However, it does not tell us anything about the situation when the vampire is not awake.\n\n2. The mummy might not have been awake.\nThis statement tells us that there is a possibility that the mummy was not awake. It does not guarantee that the mummy was not awake, just that it is a possibility.\n\nNow, let's try to infer if the vampire was not awake based on these statements. If the mummy was not awake, then according to statement 1, the vampire could not have been awake. However, since statement 2 only tells us that the mummy might not have been awake, we cannot be certain that the mummy was not awake. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the vampire was not awake based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
