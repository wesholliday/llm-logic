Jen might not have watched basketball.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football. However, statement 2 only tells us that Jen might not have watched basketball, not that she definitely did not watch it.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to confirm whether Jen watched basketball or not, we cannot definitively infer that Tom did not watch football. \n\nAnswer: no",
