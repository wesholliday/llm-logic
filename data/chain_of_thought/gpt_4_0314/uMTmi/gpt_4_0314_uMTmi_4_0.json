If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\nThis statement tells us that if the alien visited Mars, it is certain that the robot visited Jupiter. However, it does not tell us anything about what happens if the alien did not visit Mars.\n\n2. The robot might not have visited Jupiter.\nThis statement tells us that there is a possibility that the robot did not visit Jupiter. It does not tell us whether the alien visited Mars or not.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements and analyze the possibilities:\n\n- If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter. But we know that there is a possibility that the robot did not visit Jupiter. So, in this case, it would mean that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\n- If the alien did not visit Mars, we don't have any information about the robot's visit to Jupiter. So, we cannot infer anything about the alien's visit to Mars in this case.\n\nSince we have a case where the alien did not visit Mars (when the robot did not visit Jupiter), we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
