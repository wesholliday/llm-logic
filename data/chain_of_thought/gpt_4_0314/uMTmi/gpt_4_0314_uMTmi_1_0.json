Sue might not have been at the wedding.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary must not have been at the wedding either. This is because if Mary was at the wedding, Sue would have to be there as well.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it's possible that Sue was not at the wedding. Since we know from statement 1 that if Sue is not at the wedding, then Mary cannot be at the wedding, we can infer that it's possible that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively say that Mary was not at the wedding, as there is no information that directly states or proves that Mary was not there. We only know that it's possible that she wasn't there.\n\nAnswer: no",
