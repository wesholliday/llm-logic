The truck might not have been blue.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the car is red, the truck has to be blue. However, statement 2 tells us that the truck might not have been blue, but it doesn't say that the truck was definitely not blue.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to confirm that the truck was not blue, we cannot infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: no",
