The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the car being red) is true, then the consequence (the truck being blue) must also be true.\n2. The second statement tells us that the car was not red.\n\nSince the car was not red, the condition in the first statement is false. In a conditional statement, when the condition is false, the consequence can be either true or false. In other words, we cannot determine the color of the truck based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
