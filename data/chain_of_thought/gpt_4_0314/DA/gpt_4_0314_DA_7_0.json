The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Alex finishing the race) is true, then the result (Chris finishing the race) must also be true. However, the second statement tells us that the condition (Alex finishing the race) is false.\n\nSince the condition is false, we cannot make any definitive conclusions about the result (Chris finishing the race) based on the given information. It could be true or false, but we don't have enough information to determine that.\n\nAnswer: no",
