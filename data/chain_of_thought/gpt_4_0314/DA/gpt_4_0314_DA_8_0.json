The vampire was not awake.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the vampire being awake) is true, then the result (the mummy being awake) must also be true.\n2. The second statement tells us that the vampire was not awake.\n\nSince the condition in the first statement (the vampire being awake) is not true, we cannot make any definitive conclusions about the mummy's state of being awake or not. The first statement only tells us what would happen if the vampire was awake, but it doesn't tell us anything about the mummy's state when the vampire is not awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
