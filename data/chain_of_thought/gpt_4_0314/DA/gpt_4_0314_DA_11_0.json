The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (cake being chocolate) is true, then the result (muffins being blueberry) must also be true. However, the second statement tells us that the condition (cake being chocolate) is false.\n\nSince the condition is false, we cannot make any definitive conclusions about the result (muffins being blueberry) based on the given information. The muffins could be blueberry or not, but we don't have enough information to determine that.\n\nAnswer: no",
