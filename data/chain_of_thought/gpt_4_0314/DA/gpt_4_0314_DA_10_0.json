The dog was not inside.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the dog being inside) is true, then the result (the cat being outside) must also be true.\n2. The second statement tells us that the dog was not inside.\n\nSince the condition (the dog being inside) is not true, we cannot make any definitive conclusions about the result (the cat being outside) based on the given information. The cat could be either outside or not outside, but we don't have enough information to determine which is the case.\n\nAnswer: no",
