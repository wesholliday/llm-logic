The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the result (the banana being yellow) must also be true. However, the second statement tells us that the apple was not red.\n\nSince the condition (the apple being red) is false, the conditional statement does not give us any information about the result (the banana being yellow). The banana could be yellow or not yellow, but we cannot infer either from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
