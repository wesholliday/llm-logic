The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (shirt being cotton) is true, then the result (pants being denim) must also be true. However, the second statement tells us that the condition (shirt being cotton) is false.\n\nSince the condition is false, the conditional statement does not give us any information about the result (pants being denim). Therefore, we cannot infer whether the pants were denim or not based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
