Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information:\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the result (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true. However, the second statement tells us that Mary was not at the wedding. Since the condition is not met, we cannot make any definitive conclusions about Sue's presence at the wedding based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
