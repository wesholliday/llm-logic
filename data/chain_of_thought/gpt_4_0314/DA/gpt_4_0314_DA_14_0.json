The bear was not in the cave.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure of these statements. The first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\n\nIf A (bear in the cave), then B (wolf in the den).\n\nThe second statement tells us that A (bear in the cave) is false. In a conditional statement, if the antecedent (A) is false, the conditional statement as a whole is still considered true, regardless of whether the consequent (B) is true or false. In other words, we cannot draw any conclusions about the wolf being in the den or not based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
