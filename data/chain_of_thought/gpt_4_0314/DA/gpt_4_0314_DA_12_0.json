Joe did not go to the park.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Joe going to the park) is true, then the result (Lucy going to the zoo) must also be true. However, the second statement tells us that Joe did not go to the park. Since the condition is not met, we cannot make any definitive conclusions about whether Lucy went to the zoo or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
