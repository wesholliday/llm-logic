Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Sue choosing pizza) is true, then the second part (Bob choosing pasta) must also be true. However, statement 2 tells us that Sue did not choose pizza. Since the first part of the conditional statement is false, we cannot make any definitive conclusions about the second part (Bob choosing pasta).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Bob did not choose pasta based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
