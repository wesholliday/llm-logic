Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the result (Amy playing tennis) must also be true. However, the second statement tells us that the condition (Jeff playing basketball) is false.\n\nSince the condition is false, we cannot make any definitive conclusions about the result (Amy playing tennis) based on the given information. It is possible that Amy played tennis for some other reason, or she did not play tennis at all.\n\nAnswer: no",
