The book was not written by James.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logic:\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the book was written by James) is true, then the result (the book is a mystery novel) must also be true. However, the second statement tells us that the condition is false (the book was not written by James).\n\nIn this case, we cannot infer anything about the result (whether the book is a mystery novel or not) because the conditional statement only tells us what happens if the condition is true, not what happens if the condition is false.\n\nAnswer: no",
