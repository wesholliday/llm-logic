The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (doll being plastic) is true, then the result (truck being metal) must also be true. However, the second statement tells us that the doll was not plastic. Since the condition is not met, we cannot make any definitive conclusions about the truck being metal or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
