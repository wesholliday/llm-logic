The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the result (Kate ate the salad) must also be true. However, if the condition is false, the result can be either true or false. In other words, if Ben didn't eat pasta, we cannot be certain about whether Kate ate the salad or not.\n\n2. The second statement tells us that Ben did not eat pasta. Since the condition in the first statement is false, we cannot draw any conclusions about whether Kate ate the salad or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Kate did not eat the salad based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
