If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nIf Erin might not have taken a train, it means there is a possibility that Erin did not take a train. \n\nIf Sam took a plane, then according to statement 2, Erin must have taken a train. But since there is a possibility that Erin did not take a train, it means there is a possibility that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively conclude that Sam did not take a plane, as there might be other scenarios where Sam took a plane and Erin took a train.\n\nAnswer: no",
