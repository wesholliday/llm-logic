If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nIf the car was red, then according to statement 2, the truck must have been blue. However, statement 1 tells us that the truck might not have been blue. This means that there is a possibility that the truck was not blue, which contradicts the condition in statement 2 that the truck must have been blue if the car was red.\n\nSince the two statements cannot be true at the same time if the car was red, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
