It does not give us any certainty about the wolf's location.\n\n2. \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\"\nThis statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf's location is certain, and it was in the den.\n\nNow, let's try to infer if \"The bear was not in the cave\" from these statements.\n\nIf the bear was in the cave, then according to statement 2, the wolf must have been in the den. However, statement 1 tells us that there is a possibility that the wolf was not in the den. This means that there is a possibility that the bear was not in the cave. But we cannot be certain about the bear's location based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
