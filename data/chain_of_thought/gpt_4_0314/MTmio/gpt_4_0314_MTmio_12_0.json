            "content": "Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"Lucy might not have gone to the zoo\" - This means that there is a possibility that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n2. \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" - This is a conditional statement. If the first part (Joe went to the park) is true, then the second part (Lucy went to the zoo) must also be true.\n\nNow, let's try to infer \"Joe did not go to the park\" from these statements.\n\nAssume that Joe went to the park. According to statement 2, if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. However, statement 1 tells us that there is a possibility that Lucy did not go to the zoo. This creates a contradiction, as we cannot have both Lucy going to the zoo and not going to the zoo at the same time.\n\nSince assuming that Joe went to the park leads to a contradiction, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
