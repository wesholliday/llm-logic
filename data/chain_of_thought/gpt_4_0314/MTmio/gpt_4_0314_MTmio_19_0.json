Jen might not have watched basketball.\nThis statement tells us that it's possible that Jen did not watch basketball, but it doesn't confirm whether she watched it or not.\n\n2. If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\nThis statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that if Tom watched football, then it's certain that Jen watched basketball.\n\nNow, let's try to infer if Tom did not watch football.\n\nIf we assume that Tom watched football, then according to statement 2, Jen must have watched basketball. However, statement 1 tells us that it's possible that Jen did not watch basketball. Since there is no contradiction between the two statements, we cannot definitively infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: no",
