If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\n\nWe are asked to infer if 'The alien did not visit Mars' from these statements.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n- If the alien visited Mars, then according to statement 2, the robot must have visited Jupiter. But this contradicts statement 1, which says the robot might not have visited Jupiter. So, the alien cannot visit Mars in this case.\n\n- If the alien did not visit Mars, then statement 2 does not provide any information about the robot visiting Jupiter. In this case, statement 1 still holds true, as the robot might not have visited Jupiter.\n\nSince the only possibility that does not lead to a contradiction is the one where the alien did not visit Mars, we can infer that 'The alien did not visit Mars'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
