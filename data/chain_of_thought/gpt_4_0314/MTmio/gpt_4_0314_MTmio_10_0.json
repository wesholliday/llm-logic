It doesn't confirm whether the cat was inside or outside.\n\n2. If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\nThis statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the dog was inside, then the cat was definitely outside.\n\nNow, let's try to infer if the dog was not inside.\n\nIf we assume that the dog was inside, then according to statement 2, the cat must have been outside. However, statement 1 tells us that there is a possibility that the cat was not outside. This means that there is a possibility that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
