If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's think step by step:\n\nIf the book was written by James, then according to statement 2, it must be a mystery novel. However, statement 1 tells us that the book might not be a mystery novel. This means that there is a possibility that the book was not written by James, as that would contradict statement 2.\n\nSo, can we infer \"The book was not written by James\" from these statements?\n\nAnswer: no",
