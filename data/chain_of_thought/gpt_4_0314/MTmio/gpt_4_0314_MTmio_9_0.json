If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nWe are asked to infer if 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt' from these statements.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\nA. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then according to statement 2, Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This contradicts statement 1, which says Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\n\nB. If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then statement 2 does not provide any information about Mark's shirt. In this case, it is possible that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, which is consistent with statement 1.\n\nSince the only scenario that is consistent with both statements is the one where Lisa did not buy the red shirt, we can infer that 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
