If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nIf Sue chose pizza, according to statement 2, Bob must have chosen pasta. However, statement 1 tells us that there is a possibility that Bob did not choose pasta. If Bob did not choose pasta, then it contradicts the condition in statement 2 that if Sue chose pizza, Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\nTherefore, to avoid this contradiction, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
