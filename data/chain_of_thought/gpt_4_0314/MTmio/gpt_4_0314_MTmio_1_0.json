Sue might not have been at the wedding.\nThis statement tells us that there is a possibility that Sue was not at the wedding, but it doesn't confirm whether she was there or not.\n\n2. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\nThis statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was definitely at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's try to infer whether Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nIf we assume that Mary was at the wedding, then according to statement 2, Sue must have been at the wedding. However, statement 1 tells us that there is a possibility that Sue was not at the wedding. This means that there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding, because if she were, Sue would have to be there as well.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
