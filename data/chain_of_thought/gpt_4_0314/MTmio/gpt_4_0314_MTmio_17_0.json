If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\nThis statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that if Ben ate pasta, then it is certain that Kate ate salad.\n\nNow, let's try to infer if Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nIf Ben ate pasta, then according to statement 2, Kate must have eaten salad. However, statement 1 tells us that there is a possibility that Kate did not eat salad. This means that there is a possibility that Ben did not eat pasta, as Kate not eating salad would contradict statement 2.\n\nAnswer: no",
