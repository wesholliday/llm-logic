It does not confirm whether the unicorn was or was not in the forest.\n\n2. \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest\" - This statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must also have been in the forest. However, it does not provide any information about the griffin's presence in the forest.\n\nNow, let's try to infer whether \"The griffin was not in the forest\" from these statements.\n\nIf the griffin was in the forest, then according to statement 2, the unicorn must also have been in the forest. However, statement 1 tells us that there is a possibility that the unicorn was not in the forest. This means that there is a possibility that the griffin was not in the forest, as the presence of the griffin would require the presence of the unicorn.\n\nHowever, the given statements do not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the griffin was not in the forest. There is still a possibility that both the griffin and the unicorn were in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no",
