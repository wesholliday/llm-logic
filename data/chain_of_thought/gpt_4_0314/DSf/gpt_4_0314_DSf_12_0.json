It can be either in the closet or over the chair.\n\n2. \"The jacket isn't hanging in the closet\" - This statement eliminates one of the possibilities mentioned in the first statement, which is the jacket being in the closet.\n\nNow, since we know that the jacket is not in the closet, and the first statement tells us that it must be in one of the two locations, we can infer that the jacket must be in the other location, which is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
