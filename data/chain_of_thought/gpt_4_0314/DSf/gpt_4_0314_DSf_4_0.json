The cat isn't playing in the bedroom.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n- The first statement presents two possibilities: the cat is either playing in the bedroom or napping on the couch.\n- The second statement eliminates one of the possibilities: the cat is not playing in the bedroom.\n\nSince the first statement presents an \"either-or\" scenario, and the second statement eliminates one of the options, we can infer that the remaining option must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
