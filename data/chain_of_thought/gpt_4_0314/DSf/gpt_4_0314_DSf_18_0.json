The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n- The first statement presents two possibilities: the notebook is either on the nightstand or in the drawer.\n- The second statement eliminates one of those possibilities: the notebook is not on the nightstand.\n\nSince the first statement tells us that the notebook must be in one of those two locations, and the second statement eliminates the possibility of it being on the nightstand, we can infer that the notebook must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
