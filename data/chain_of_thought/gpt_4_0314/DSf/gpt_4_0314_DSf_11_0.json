The newspaper isn't sitting on the porch.\n\nThe first statement presents two possibilities for the location of the newspaper: on the porch or in the driveway. The second statement eliminates one of those possibilities, stating that the newspaper is not on the porch. Since there are only two possible locations mentioned in the first statement, and one of them has been ruled out by the second statement, we can infer that the newspaper must be in the remaining location.\n\nAnswer: yes",
