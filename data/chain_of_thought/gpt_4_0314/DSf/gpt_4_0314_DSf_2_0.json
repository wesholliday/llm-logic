The book isn't resting on the table.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n- The first statement presents two possibilities: the book is either on the table or on the shelf.\n- The second statement eliminates one of those possibilities: the book is not on the table.\n\nSince the first statement presents only two possibilities and the second statement eliminates one of them, we can infer that the remaining possibility must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
