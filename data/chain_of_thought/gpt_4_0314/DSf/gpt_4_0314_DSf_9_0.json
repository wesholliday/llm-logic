The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nSince the first statement presents two possibilities (blending in on the floor or in the box), and the second statement negates one of those possibilities (not blending in on the floor), we can infer that the only remaining possibility is that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
