It must be in one of these two places.\n\n2. \"The toy isn't sitting on the shelf\" - This statement eliminates one of the possibilities mentioned in the first statement.\n\nNow, since we know that the toy must be in one of the two places mentioned in the first statement, and the second statement eliminates the possibility of it being on the shelf, we can infer that the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
