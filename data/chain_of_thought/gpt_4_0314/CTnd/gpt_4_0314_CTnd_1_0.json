It tells us that when it's raining (R), it's not raining hard (not H). This means that it could be raining lightly or moderately, but not hard.\n\nThe statement we want to infer is the opposite: if it's raining hard (H), then it's not raining (not R). This statement is contradictory because if it's raining hard, it is still raining. Raining hard is a subset of raining, so it's impossible for it to be raining hard and not raining at the same time.\n\nAnswer: no",
