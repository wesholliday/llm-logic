However, it does not provide any information about the scenario when the room is cleaned thoroughly. We cannot infer the relationship between a thoroughly cleaned room and it not being cleaned from the given statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
