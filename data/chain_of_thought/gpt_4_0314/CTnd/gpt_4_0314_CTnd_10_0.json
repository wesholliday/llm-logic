However, this does not imply that if helpful advice was offered (H), then advice was not offered (not A). In fact, it is contradictory because if helpful advice was offered, then advice must have been offered.\n\nSo, we cannot infer the statement \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
