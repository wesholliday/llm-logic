This means that a recommendation can be made, but it cannot be strong.\n\nThe statement we need to infer suggests that if a strong recommendation (S) was made, then there was no recommendation (not R). This contradicts the fact that a strong recommendation is still a type of recommendation.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the given statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
