The given statement is A \u2192 B, and the statement we need to infer is the contrapositive of the given statement, which is \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA. The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the statement 'If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
