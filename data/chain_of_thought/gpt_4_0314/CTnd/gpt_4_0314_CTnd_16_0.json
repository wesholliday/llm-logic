(A = job was completed, B = job was completed well)\n\nStatement to infer: If the job was completed well, then it was not completed.\nThis can be represented as: If B, then not A.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logic:\n\nThe given statement tells us that if the job was completed (A), then it was not completed well (not B). However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the job was completed well (B). We cannot directly infer the relationship between B and not A from the given statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement 'If the job was completed well, then it was not completed' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
