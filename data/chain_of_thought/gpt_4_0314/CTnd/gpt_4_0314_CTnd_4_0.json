(A = Ben studied, B = Ben studied diligently)\n\nStatement to infer: If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study.\nThis can be represented as: If B, then not A.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logic:\n\nThe given statement tells us that if Ben studied (A), then he did not study diligently (not B). However, it does not provide any information about what happens if Ben studied diligently (B). We cannot assume that if Ben studied diligently, then he did not study (not A), as this information is not given in the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the desired statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
