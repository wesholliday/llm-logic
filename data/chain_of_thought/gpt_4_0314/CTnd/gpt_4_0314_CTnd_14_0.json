However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the meal was prepared carefully. We cannot assume that if the meal was prepared carefully, it was not prepared at all, as this is not given in the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the desired statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
