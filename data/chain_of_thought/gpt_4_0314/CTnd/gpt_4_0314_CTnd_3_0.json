(P = I ate a meal, Q = I ate a large meal)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer the following statement: \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal.\"\n\nThis can be represented as: If Q, then not P.\n\nTo determine if we can infer this statement, let's look at the contrapositive of the given statement. The contrapositive is formed by negating both P and Q and reversing their order. So, the contrapositive of the given statement would be: If not (not Q), then not P.\n\nSimplifying the double negation, we get: If Q, then not P.\n\nAs we can see, the contrapositive of the given statement is the same as the statement we want to infer. Therefore, we can infer the statement \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
