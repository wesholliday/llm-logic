This means that if someone received directions, they must have been unclear. \n\nThe contrapositive says that if directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided. This means that if someone received clear directions, they must not have been provided in the first place, which is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the contrapositive from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
