However, it does not provide any information about what happens when a customer is greeted warmly. We cannot assume that if a customer is greeted warmly, they were not greeted at all, as this would be a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the desired statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
