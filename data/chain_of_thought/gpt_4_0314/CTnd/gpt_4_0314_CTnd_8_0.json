However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the issue was addressed effectively (B). We cannot assume that if the issue was addressed effectively (B), then it was not addressed (not A) based on the given statement alone.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement to infer from the given statement. \n\nAnswer: no",
