However, this statement does not provide any information about what happens if the room was tidied thoroughly (B). It is possible that the room was tidied thoroughly (B) and still tidied (A), or it was tidied thoroughly (B) and not tidied (\u00acA). We cannot determine the relationship between B and A based on the given statement alone.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the desired statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
