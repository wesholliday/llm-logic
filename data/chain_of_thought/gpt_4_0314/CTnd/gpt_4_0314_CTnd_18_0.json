(A = issue was discussed, B = issue was discussed in depth)\n\nStatement to infer: If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed.\nThis can be represented as: If B, then not A.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logic:\n\nIf A (the issue was discussed), then we know that not B (it was not discussed in depth). However, this does not necessarily mean that if B (the issue was discussed in depth), then not A (it was not discussed). In fact, if the issue was discussed in depth, it implies that it was discussed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement 'If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
