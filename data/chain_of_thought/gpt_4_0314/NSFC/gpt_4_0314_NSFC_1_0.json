It does not provide information about whether both events can happen simultaneously or not. The statement does not exclude the possibility that John might do both, but it also does not guarantee it. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"John might clean his room and John might go to the lecture\" based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
