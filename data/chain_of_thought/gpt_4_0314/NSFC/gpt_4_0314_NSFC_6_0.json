The statement is using \"or\" to indicate that one of the two options is possible. If we were to infer \"The package might arrive on Monday and the package might arrive on Tuesday,\" we would be suggesting that there is a possibility for the package to arrive on both days, which is not the same as the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
