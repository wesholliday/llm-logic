This statement does not guarantee that both outcomes will happen, but rather that one of them might happen. When we rephrase the statement as \"The team might win the match and the team might lose the match,\" we are still expressing the same idea that there are two possible outcomes for the team. Both statements convey the uncertainty of the outcome and the possibility of either winning or losing.\n\nAnswer: yes",
