The statement does not provide any information about the likelihood of either outcome, only that they are both possibilities. The second statement, \"The student might pass the exam and the student might fail the exam,\" essentially conveys the same information, as it also acknowledges that both passing and failing are possible outcomes for the student. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
