This statement does not provide any certainty about which outcome will occur, but it does establish that both possibilities exist. When we rephrase the statement as \"The candidate might win the election and the candidate might lose the election,\" we are essentially saying the same thing: both outcomes are possible. The use of \"and\" in this context does not imply that both outcomes will happen simultaneously, but rather that both possibilities are present.\n\nAnswer: yes",
