An argument is logically valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nIn this case, the premise states that if the oven is on (P), then the kitchen is warm (Q). The conclusion states that if the oven is on (P) and the pilot light is out (\u00acR), then the kitchen is warm (Q).\n\nSince the conclusion only adds an additional condition (the pilot light being out) to the premise, it does not contradict or negate the premise. The premise still holds true, as the oven being on implies the kitchen is warm, regardless of the state of the pilot light.\n\nTherefore, the form of this argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
