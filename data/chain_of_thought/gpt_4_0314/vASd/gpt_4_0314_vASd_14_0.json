However, it does not provide any information about the language of the test. The conclusion introduces a new condition (the test being in Chinese) that was not present in the premise. \n\nSince the premise does not provide any information about the language of the test, we cannot conclude that studying hard will lead to passing the test if it is in Chinese. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
