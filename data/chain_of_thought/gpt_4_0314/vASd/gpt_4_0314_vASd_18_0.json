However, the conclusion adds an additional condition (no sunlight) to the premise. The premise does not provide any information about the effect of sunlight on the growth of the plants. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the plants will grow if there is no sunlight, even if they are watered.\n\nAnswer: no",
