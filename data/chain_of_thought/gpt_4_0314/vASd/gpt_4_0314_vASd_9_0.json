However, the conclusion introduces an additional condition: the essay is turned in late (R). The premise does not provide any information about the effect of turning in the essay late on the student's grade.\n\nSince the premise does not address the additional condition (R) introduced in the conclusion, we cannot conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
