However, the conclusion introduces a new condition - the garage is flooding. This new condition is not addressed in the premise, and it could potentially affect the safety of the car.\n\nSince the conclusion introduces a new condition that is not accounted for in the premise, we cannot say that the conclusion follows from the premise. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
