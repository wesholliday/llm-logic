However, it does not provide any information about the conditions under which the match is struck, such as whether it has been soaked in water or not.\n\nThe conclusion introduces a new condition: the match has been soaked in water. This new condition is not addressed in the premise, so we cannot determine if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
