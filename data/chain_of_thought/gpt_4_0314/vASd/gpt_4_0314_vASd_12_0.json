However, the conclusion introduces an additional condition (the computer catching on fire) that was not present in the premise.\n\nFor the argument to be logically valid, the conclusion must necessarily follow from the premise. In this case, the conclusion introduces a new condition that is not addressed in the premise, so we cannot say that the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
