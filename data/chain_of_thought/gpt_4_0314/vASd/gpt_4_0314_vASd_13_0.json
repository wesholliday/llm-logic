However, the conclusion introduces an additional factor - eating junk food - which is not mentioned in the premise. The conclusion assumes that even with the addition of junk food, exercising will still lead to weight loss.\n\nSince the premise does not provide any information about the effect of eating junk food on weight loss, we cannot conclude that exercising and eating junk food will necessarily lead to weight loss. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
