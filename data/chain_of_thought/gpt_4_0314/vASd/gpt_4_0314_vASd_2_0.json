The premise is \"If we go to the concert, then we'll have a good time.\" This can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"we go to the concert\" and Q is \"we'll have a good time.\"\n\n2. The conclusion is \"If we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time.\" This can be represented as (P \u2227 R) \u2192 Q, where R is \"a bomb goes off.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the logical validity of the argument. An argument is logically valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nIn this case, the premise only guarantees that we'll have a good time if we go to the concert. It does not account for the additional condition of a bomb going off. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
