However, the conclusion adds an additional condition - that there is a drought. The premise does not provide any information about how the lawn will be affected by a drought, whether it is fertilized or not.\n\nSince the conclusion introduces a new condition (drought) that is not addressed in the premise, we cannot determine if the conclusion is logically valid based on the given premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
