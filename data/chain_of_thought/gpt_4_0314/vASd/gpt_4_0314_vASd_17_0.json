A logically valid argument is one where if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the premise states that changing the oil (A) will result in the car running smoothly (B). However, the conclusion introduces a new condition - the transmission being shot (C) - and claims that if both A and C are true, then B will still be true.\n\nThe problem here is that the premise does not provide any information about the relationship between the transmission being shot (C) and the car running smoothly (B). Therefore, we cannot conclude that if both A and C are true, then B will still be true.\n\nAnswer: no",
