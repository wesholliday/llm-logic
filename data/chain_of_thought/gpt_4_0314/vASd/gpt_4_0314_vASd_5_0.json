An argument is logically valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nIn this case, the premise states that if the bill is paid (P), the services will continue (Q). The conclusion states that if the bill is paid (P) and the check bounces (R), the services will continue (Q).\n\nThe conclusion adds an additional condition (R) to the premise, but it doesn't contradict the premise. If the bill is paid (P), the services will continue (Q), regardless of whether the check bounces (R) or not.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
