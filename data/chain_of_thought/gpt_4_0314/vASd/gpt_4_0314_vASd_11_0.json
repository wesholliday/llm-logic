However, the conclusion introduces an additional condition (doing hard labor) that is not addressed in the premise. It is possible that doing hard labor could still make someone tired even if they get enough sleep.\n\nSince the conclusion introduces a new condition that is not addressed in the premise, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
