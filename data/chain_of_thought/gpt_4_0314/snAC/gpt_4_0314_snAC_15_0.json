Erin took a train.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure of these statements. The first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Sam took a plane\" and Q is \"Erin took a train.\" The second statement is a simple statement, which is just Q.\n\nWe are asked if it necessarily follows that P (Sam took a plane) is true. To determine this, we need to see if there is a logical connection between the given statements that guarantees P is true.\n\nHowever, the given statements do not provide enough information to guarantee that P is true. The first statement tells us that if P is true, then Q is true. The second statement tells us that Q is true. But we cannot conclude from this information that P must be true. It is possible that Q is true for some other reason, and P is not true.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that Sam took a plane.\n\nAnswer: no",
