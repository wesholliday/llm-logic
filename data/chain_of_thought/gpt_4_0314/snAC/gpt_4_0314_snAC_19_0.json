Jen watched basketball (B)\n\nWe are asked if it necessarily follows that Tom watched football (A).\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (A) is true, then the second part (B) must also be true. However, it does not guarantee that if B is true, then A must be true.\n\nIn this case, we know that Jen watched basketball (B), but we don't have enough information to determine whether Tom watched football (A) or not. It is possible that Tom watched football, but it is also possible that he did not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that Tom watched football based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
