Amy played tennis (Q)\n\nWe are asked if it necessarily follows that Jeff played basketball (P).\n\nThe given statements are an example of the logical concept called \"affirming the consequent.\" Affirming the consequent is a logical fallacy because it assumes that if the consequent (Q) is true, then the antecedent (P) must also be true. However, this is not necessarily the case.\n\nFor example, it could be that Amy played tennis for some other reason unrelated to Jeff playing basketball. The fact that Amy played tennis does not guarantee that Jeff played basketball.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that Jeff played basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
