(B)\n\nWe are asked if it necessarily follows that the cake was chocolate (A).\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement (If A, then B). It tells us that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. However, it does not tell us that the cake being chocolate is the only way for the muffins to be blueberry.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the muffins were indeed blueberry. But this information alone does not guarantee that the cake was chocolate. There could be other reasons for the muffins being blueberry.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot necessarily conclude that the cake was chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no",
