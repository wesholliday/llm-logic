This statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q is \"Bob chose pasta.\" The statement is true if either P is false and Q is true, or both P and Q are true.\n\n2. \"Bob chose pasta\" is true. This means that Q is true.\n\nNow, we need to determine if \"Sue chose pizza\" (P) is necessarily true based on the given information.\n\nSince Q is true, the conditional statement P \u2192 Q can be true in two cases:\n\na) P is false and Q is true.\nb) Both P and Q are true.\n\nWe don't have enough information to determine which of these cases is true. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"Sue chose pizza\" is necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: no",
