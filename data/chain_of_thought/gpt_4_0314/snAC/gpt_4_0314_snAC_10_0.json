The cat was outside. (This is a statement about Q)\n\nWe are asked if it necessarily follows that the dog was inside (P).\n\nThe given information tells us that if P is true, then Q is true. However, we are only given that Q is true, not that P is true. It is possible that the dog was inside, but it is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
