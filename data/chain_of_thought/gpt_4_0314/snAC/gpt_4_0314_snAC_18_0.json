(Q)\n\nWe are asked if it necessarily follows that the doll was plastic (P).\n\nThe given statements are in the form of a conditional statement (If P, then Q). However, we are given the truth of Q (The truck was metal) and asked to determine the truth of P (The doll was plastic).\n\nIn this case, we cannot directly conclude the truth of P based on the truth of Q. This is because the conditional statement only tells us what happens if P is true, not what happens if Q is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot necessarily conclude that the doll was plastic based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
