The book is a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure of these statements. The first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\n\nJames \u2192 Mystery\n\nwhere \"James\" represents \"the book was written by James\" and \"Mystery\" represents \"the book is a mystery novel.\" The arrow (\u2192) represents the \"if...then...\" relationship.\n\nThe second statement is a simple statement:\n\nMystery\n\nNow, we are asked if it necessarily follows that the book was written by James. In other words, we want to know if the following statement is true:\n\nJames\n\nHowever, from the given information, we cannot conclude that the book was written by James. The first statement tells us that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. But it does not tell us that James is the only author who writes mystery novels. There could be other authors who also write mystery novels.\n\nSince we only know that the book is a mystery novel, we cannot conclude that it was written by James. It could have been written by another author who also writes mystery novels.\n\nAnswer: no",
