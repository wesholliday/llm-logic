However, it does not tell us that Mary must be at the wedding for Sue to be there. It is possible that Sue was at the wedding for some other reason, and Mary's presence is not a requirement for Sue's presence.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
