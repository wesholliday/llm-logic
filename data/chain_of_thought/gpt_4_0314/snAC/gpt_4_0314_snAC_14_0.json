The wolf was in the den. (This is a given fact: B)\n\nNow, we need to determine if the bear was in the cave (A) based on the given information.\n\nThe first statement tells us that if A is true, then B is true. However, it does not tell us anything about the situation when B is true. It could be that A is true, or it could be that A is false and some other factor caused B to be true.\n\nSince we only know that B is true, we cannot definitively conclude that A (the bear was in the cave) is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
