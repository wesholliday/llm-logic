(B)\n\nWe are asked if it necessarily follows that the alien visited Mars (A).\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement (If A, then B). It tells us that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. However, it does not tell us what happens if the robot visited Jupiter without the alien visiting Mars.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the robot visited Jupiter (B). But we don't have enough information to determine whether the alien visited Mars (A) or not.\n\nSo, it does not necessarily follow that the alien visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: no",
