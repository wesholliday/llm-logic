This statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: A \u2192 C, where A represents \"Alex finished the race\" and C represents \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\n2. \"Chris finished the race\" is true. This statement can be represented as: C.\n\nNow, we need to determine if it necessarily follows that \"Alex finished the race\" (A) is true.\n\nThe given conditional statement (A \u2192 C) tells us that if A is true, then C must be true. However, it does not tell us anything about the truth value of A when C is true. In other words, knowing that Chris finished the race (C) does not necessarily mean that Alex finished the race (A).\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that \"Alex finished the race\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
