The mummy was awake (M)\n\nWe are asked if it necessarily follows that the vampire was awake (V).\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement (If V, then M). It tells us that if the vampire was awake, the mummy must also be awake. However, it does not tell us what happens if the mummy is awake without any information about the vampire.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the mummy was indeed awake. But this information alone does not provide any direct information about the vampire's state.\n\nSince we do not have enough information to conclude that the vampire was awake, we cannot say that it necessarily follows that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
