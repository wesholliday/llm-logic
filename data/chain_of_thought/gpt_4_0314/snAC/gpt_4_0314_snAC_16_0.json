The pants were denim.\n\nWe are asked if it necessarily follows that the shirt was cotton.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the shirt was cotton) is true, then the second part (the pants were denim) must also be true. However, this statement does not guarantee that the shirt being cotton is the only way for the pants to be denim.\n\nThe second statement confirms that the pants were indeed denim. But this information alone does not provide enough evidence to conclude that the shirt was cotton. There could be other reasons for the pants being denim.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that the shirt was cotton.\n\nAnswer: no",
