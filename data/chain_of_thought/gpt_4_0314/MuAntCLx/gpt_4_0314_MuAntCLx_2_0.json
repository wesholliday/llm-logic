In this case, we are given the statement \"The bimboozle must be on the plonk.\" We are asked if we can infer \"The bimboozle must be on the plonk and froodle a wobble quank\" from the given statement. Since the given statement does not provide any information or evidence about \"froodle a wobble quank,\" we cannot infer the combined statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
