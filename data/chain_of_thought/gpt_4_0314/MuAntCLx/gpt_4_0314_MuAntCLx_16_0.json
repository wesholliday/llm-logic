In this case, we are given the statement \"The zibble must be wozzle zump.\" However, we are not given any information about \"frazzle wozzle wibble.\" Since we do not have any evidence or reasoning to support the addition of \"frazzle wozzle wibble\" to the original statement, we cannot infer that \"The zibble must be wozzle zump and frazzle wozzle wibble.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
