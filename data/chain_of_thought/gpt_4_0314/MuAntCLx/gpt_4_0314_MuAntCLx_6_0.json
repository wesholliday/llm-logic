In this case, we are given the statement \"The crunk must be blimp wobble\" and asked if we can infer \"The crunk must be blimp wobble and zibble at quank wump\" from it. The original statement does not provide any information about \"zibble at quank wump,\" so we cannot infer the second statement based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
