In this case, we are given the statement \"The wobble must be wozzle.\" We are asked to infer if this statement implies \"The wobble must be wozzle and wumble flim fribble.\" Since there is no information or evidence provided about \"wumble flim fribble\" in the original statement, we cannot infer that the wobble must be both wozzle and wumble flim fribble.\n\nAnswer: no",
