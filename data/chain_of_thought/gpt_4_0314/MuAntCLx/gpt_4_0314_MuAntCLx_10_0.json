In this case, we are given the statement \"The plimp must be fribble.\" However, we are not given any information about \"zump\" or its relationship to \"plimp\" or \"fribble.\" Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The plimp must be fribble and zump\" based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
