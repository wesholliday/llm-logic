In this case, we are given the statement \"The bimboozle must be at snorkel quank.\" However, we are not given any information about the \"flump quazzle.\" Without any evidence or reasoning to connect the bimboozle to the flump quazzle, we cannot infer that the bimboozle must be at snorkel quank and in the flump quazzle.\n\nAnswer: no",
