Second premise: It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch (\u00acB).\n3. Conclusion: The remote control is on the coffee table (A).\n\nThis argument has the form of a disjunction elimination, which is a valid form of argument. If we have a disjunction (A \u2228 B) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false (\u00acB), then we can conclude that the other disjunct must be true (A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
