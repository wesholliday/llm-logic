Second premise: It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf (\u00acB).\n3. Conclusion: The toy is in the toy box (A).\n\nThis argument is in the form of a disjunction (A \u2228 B) and a negation of one of the disjuncts (\u00acB). If we know that either A or B is true, and we also know that B is not true, then we can logically conclude that A must be true.\n\nSo, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
