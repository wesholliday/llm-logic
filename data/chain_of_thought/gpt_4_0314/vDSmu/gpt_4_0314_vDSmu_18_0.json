Second premise: It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand (\u00acB).\n3. Conclusion: The notebook is in the drawer (A).\n\nThis argument has the form of a disjunction (A \u2228 B) and a negation of one of the disjuncts (\u00acB). If we know that either A or B is true, and we also know that B is not true, then it must be the case that A is true.\n\nSo, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
