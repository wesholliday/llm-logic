This can be represented as A \u2228 B.\n2. Second premise: It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head (\u00acB).\n3. Conclusion: The sunglasses are in her bag (A).\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion follows logically from the premises:\n\nIf A \u2228 B is true and \u00acB is true, then A must be true. This is because if B is false, the only way for A \u2228 B to be true is if A is true.\n\nSo, the conclusion (A) follows logically from the premises (A \u2228 B and \u00acB).\n\nAnswer: yes",
