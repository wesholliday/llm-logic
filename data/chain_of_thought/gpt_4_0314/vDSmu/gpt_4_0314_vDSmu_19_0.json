Second premise: It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist (\u00acB).\n3. Conclusion: The watch is charging on the dresser (A).\n\nThis argument has the form of a disjunction elimination, also known as the law of excluded middle. If we have a disjunction (A \u2228 B) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false (\u00acB), then the other disjunct must be true (A).\n\nIn this case, since we know that the watch is either charging on the dresser (A) or on his wrist (B), and we also know that it's not on his wrist (\u00acB), we can conclude that the watch must be charging on the dresser (A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
