It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor. (Premise 2)\n3. The missing puzzle piece is in the box. (Conclusion)\n\nThis argument is an example of the disjunctive syllogism, which has the following form:\n\n1. Either A or B.\n2. Not B.\n3. Therefore, A.\n\nIn this case, A represents \"the missing puzzle piece is in the box\" and B represents \"the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\" Since the argument follows the disjunctive syllogism form, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
