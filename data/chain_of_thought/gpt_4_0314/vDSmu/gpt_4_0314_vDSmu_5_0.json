Second premise: It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry (\u00acB).\n3. Conclusion: The cookies are in the jar (A).\n\nThis argument has the form of a disjunction elimination, which is a valid form of argument. If we know that either A or B is true, and we also know that B is not true, then we can conclude that A must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
