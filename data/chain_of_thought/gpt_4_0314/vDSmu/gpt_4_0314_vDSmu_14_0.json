Second premise: It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge (\u00acB).\n3. Conclusion: The milk is on the counter (A).\n\nThis argument is in the form of a disjunction (A \u2228 B) and a negation of one of the disjuncts (\u00acB), which leads to the affirmation of the other disjunct (A). This form of argument is known as disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid form of argument.\n\nAnswer: yes",
