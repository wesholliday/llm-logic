Second premise: It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk (~B).\n3. Conclusion: The pen is in my bag (A).\n\nThis argument is an example of the disjunctive syllogism, which has the following form:\n\n1. A or B\n2. ~B\n3. Therefore, A\n\nSince the argument follows the structure of a disjunctive syllogism, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
