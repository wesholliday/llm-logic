(Premise 2)\n3. Fido is inside. (Conclusion)\n\nThis argument is an example of disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid form of argument. In a disjunctive syllogism, if one of the disjuncts (parts of the \"either...or\" statement) is false, then the other disjunct must be true.\n\nIn this case, since it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden (Premise 2), the other disjunct, \"Fido is inside,\" must be true. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
