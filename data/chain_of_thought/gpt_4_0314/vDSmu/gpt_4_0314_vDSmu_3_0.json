Second premise: It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet (\u00acB).\n3. Conclusion: The keys are in the drawer (A).\n\nThis argument has the form of a disjunction elimination, also known as the law of excluded middle. If we have a disjunction (A \u2228 B) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false (\u00acB), then the other disjunct must be true (A).\n\nSince the argument follows this valid logical form, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
