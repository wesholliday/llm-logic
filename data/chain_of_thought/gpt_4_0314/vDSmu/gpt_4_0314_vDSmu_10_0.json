Second premise: It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed (\u00acB).\n3. Conclusion: The missing sock is in the laundry basket (A).\n\nThis argument has the form of a disjunction elimination, which is a valid form of argument. If we know that either A or B is true, and we know that B is not true, then we can conclude that A must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
