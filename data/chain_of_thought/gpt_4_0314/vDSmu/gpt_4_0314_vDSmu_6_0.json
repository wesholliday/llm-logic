Second premise: It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen (\u00acB).\n3. Conclusion: The phone is in the living room (A).\n\nThis argument has the form of a disjunction (A \u2228 B) and a negation of one of the disjuncts (\u00acB), which leads to the affirmation of the other disjunct (A). This is a valid form of argument known as disjunctive syllogism.\n\nAnswer: yes",
