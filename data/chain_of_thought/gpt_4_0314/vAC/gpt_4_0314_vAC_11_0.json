The muffins were blueberry.\nConclusion: The cake was chocolate.\n\nThis argument is an example of the logical fallacy called \"affirming the consequent.\" The form of the argument is:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Q.\nConclusion: P.\n\nIn this case, P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins were blueberry.\" The problem with this form of argument is that it assumes that Q can only be true if P is true. However, there could be other reasons for Q being true that are not related to P.\n\nFor example, it's possible that the muffins were blueberry because someone else made them, or because they were the only option available at the store. The fact that the muffins were blueberry does not necessarily mean that the cake was chocolate.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
