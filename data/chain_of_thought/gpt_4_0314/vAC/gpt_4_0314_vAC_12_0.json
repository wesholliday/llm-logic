(Conclusion)\n\nThis argument is an example of the logical fallacy called \"affirming the consequent.\" The form of the argument is:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Q.\n3. Therefore, P.\n\nIn this case, P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" The problem with this form of argument is that it assumes that Q can only be true if P is true. However, there could be other reasons for Q being true that are not related to P. In other words, just because Lucy went to the zoo, it doesn't necessarily mean that Joe went to the park.\n\nAnswer: no",
