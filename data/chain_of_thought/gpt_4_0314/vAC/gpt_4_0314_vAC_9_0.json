Lisa bought the red shirt. (Conclusion)\n\nThis argument is an example of the logical fallacy called \"affirming the consequent.\" The form of the argument is:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Q.\n3. Therefore, P.\n\nIn this case, P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" The problem with this form of argument is that it assumes that P is the only cause of Q, which is not necessarily true. There could be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt that are unrelated to Lisa buying the red shirt.\n\nSo, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
