(Conclusion)\n\nThis argument is an example of the logical fallacy called \"affirming the consequent.\" The form of this fallacy is:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Q.\n3. Therefore, P.\n\nIn this case, P is \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q is \"Bob chose pasta.\" The fallacy occurs because the argument assumes that if Q is true, then P must also be true. However, this is not necessarily the case. It is possible that Bob chose pasta for a reason unrelated to Sue's choice.\n\nSo, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
