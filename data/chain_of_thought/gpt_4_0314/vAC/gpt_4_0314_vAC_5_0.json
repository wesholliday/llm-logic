(Q)\n\nConclusion: Jeff played basketball. (P)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"affirming the consequent,\" which is a logical fallacy. The argument assumes that if the consequent (Q) is true, then the antecedent (P) must also be true. However, this is not necessarily the case. There could be other reasons why Amy played tennis, not just because Jeff played basketball.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
