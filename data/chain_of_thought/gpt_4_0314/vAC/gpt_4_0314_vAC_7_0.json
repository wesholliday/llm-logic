(C)\n\nConclusion: Alex finished the race. (A)\n\nThis argument is an example of the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The fallacy occurs when the consequent (C) is true, but it is incorrectly assumed that this means the antecedent (A) must also be true. However, this is not necessarily the case, as there could be other reasons for Chris finishing the race that are unrelated to Alex finishing the race.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
