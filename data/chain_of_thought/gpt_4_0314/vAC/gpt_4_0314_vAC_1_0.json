(Q)\n\nConclusion: Mary was at the wedding. (P)\n\nThis form of argument is known as affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy. The argument assumes that if the consequent (Q) is true, then the antecedent (P) must also be true. However, this is not necessarily the case. There could be other reasons for Sue being at the wedding that are unrelated to Mary's presence.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
