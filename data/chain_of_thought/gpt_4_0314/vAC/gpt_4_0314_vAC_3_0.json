The book is a mystery novel (Q)\n\nConclusion: The book was written by James (P)\n\nThis form of argument is known as affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy. The argument assumes that if the consequent (Q) is true, then the antecedent (P) must also be true. However, this is not necessarily the case, as there could be other reasons for the book being a mystery novel besides being written by James.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
