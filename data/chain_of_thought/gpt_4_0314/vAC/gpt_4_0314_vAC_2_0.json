(U)\n\nConclusion: The griffin was in the forest. (G)\n\nThis argument is an example of the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The fallacy occurs when the consequent (U) is affirmed, and it is incorrectly inferred that the antecedent (G) must also be true. In other words, just because the unicorn was in the forest, it doesn't necessarily mean that the griffin was in the forest as well. The argument would be valid if the second premise was \"The griffin was in the forest,\" but as it stands, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
