Sam took a plane (Conclusion)\n\nThis argument is an example of the logical fallacy called \"affirming the consequent.\" The form of this fallacy is:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Q\n3. Therefore, P\n\nIn this case, P is \"Sam took a plane\" and Q is \"Erin took a train.\" The fallacy occurs because the argument assumes that if Q is true, then P must also be true. However, this is not necessarily the case. It is possible that Erin took a train for some other reason unrelated to Sam taking a plane.\n\nSo, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
