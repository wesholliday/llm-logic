The unicorn was in the forest.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A (griffin in the forest), then B (unicorn in the forest). The second statement confirms that B is true (unicorn was in the forest).\n\nHowever, we are asked to determine if we can logically conclude that A (griffin was in the forest) is true. The given information only tells us that if A is true, then B is true. It does not tell us that if B is true, then A must be true. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that the griffin was in the forest based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
