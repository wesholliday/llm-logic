Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nWe are asked if we can logically conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the second part (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true. However, this statement does not guarantee that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\n\nIn this case, we know that Mark bought the blue shirt (from the second statement), but we cannot logically conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
