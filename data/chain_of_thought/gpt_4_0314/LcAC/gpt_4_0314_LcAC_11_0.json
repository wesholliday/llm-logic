If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\nThis statement can be represented as: If A, then B (where A is \"the cake was chocolate\" and B is \"the muffins were blueberry\").\n\n2. The muffins were blueberry.\nThis statement is simply B.\n\nNow, we are asked if we can logically conclude that the cake was chocolate (A) from these two statements.\n\nThe first statement (If A, then B) tells us that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. However, it does not tell us that the cake being chocolate is the only way for the muffins to be blueberry. In other words, it is possible for the muffins to be blueberry even if the cake is not chocolate.\n\nSince we only know that the muffins were blueberry (B), we cannot definitively conclude that the cake was chocolate (A) based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
