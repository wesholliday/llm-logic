The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Sue choosing pizza) is true, then the second part (Bob choosing pasta) must also be true. However, this does not mean that if the second part is true, the first part must also be true.\n\nIn other words, we know that if Sue chose pizza, Bob definitely chose pasta. But we don't know if Sue choosing pizza is the only way for Bob to choose pasta. It's possible that Bob chose pasta for some other reason, and Sue's choice had nothing to do with it.\n\nSo, given the information we have, we cannot logically conclude that Sue chose pizza just because Bob chose pasta.\n\nAnswer: no",
