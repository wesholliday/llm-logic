If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If P (car is red), then Q (truck is blue). This means that if the car is red, the truck must be blue. However, it does not guarantee that if the truck is blue, the car must be red.\n\n2. The truck was blue.\nThis statement tells us that Q (truck is blue) is true.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can logically conclude that the car was red (P) based on these two statements.\n\nThe given information only tells us that if the car is red, then the truck is blue. It does not tell us that if the truck is blue, then the car must be red. In other words, we cannot conclude that the car was red just because the truck was blue.\n\nAnswer: no",
