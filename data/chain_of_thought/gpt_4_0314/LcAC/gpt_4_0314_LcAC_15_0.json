Erin took a train (Q)\n\nWe are asked to determine if we can logically conclude that Sam took a plane (P).\n\nUsing the Modus Ponens rule, we can infer a conclusion from a conditional statement and its antecedent. However, in this case, we have the conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and the consequent (Q), not the antecedent (P).\n\nSince we don't have the antecedent, we cannot use Modus Ponens to conclude that Sam took a plane. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that Sam took a plane based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
