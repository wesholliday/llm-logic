If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If P, then Q. In this case, P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\" This statement tells us that if P is true, then Q must also be true. However, it does not tell us what happens if Q is true.\n\n2. Amy played tennis.\nThis statement tells us that Q is true.\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can logically conclude that Jeff played basketball (P is true) based on these two statements.\n\nThe given information only tells us that if Jeff played basketball (P), then Amy played tennis (Q). However, it does not tell us that if Amy played tennis (Q), then Jeff played basketball (P). In other words, we cannot conclude that P is true just because Q is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically conclude that Jeff played basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
