The first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\n\nP \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\n\nIn this case, P represents \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q represents \"Kate ate salad.\" The second statement is simply Q (Kate ate salad).\n\nHowever, the given information does not provide us with a direct statement about whether Ben ate pasta or not. We only know that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. But Kate eating salad could have happened even if Ben didn't eat pasta. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that Ben ate pasta based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
