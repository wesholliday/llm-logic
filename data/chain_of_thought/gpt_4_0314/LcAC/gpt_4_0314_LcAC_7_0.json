Chris finished the race.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure of these statements. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Alex finishing the race) is true, then the second part (Chris finishing the race) must also be true. However, this statement does not guarantee that if Chris finished the race, then Alex must have finished the race as well.\n\nThe second statement simply tells us that Chris finished the race. It does not provide any information about whether Alex finished the race or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that Alex finished the race based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
