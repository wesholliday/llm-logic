The book is a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logic:\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the book was written by James) is true, then the result (the book is a mystery novel) must also be true. However, this statement does not guarantee that James is the only author who writes mystery novels.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the book is a mystery novel, but it does not provide any information about the author.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot logically conclude that the book was written by James, as there could be other authors who write mystery novels as well.\n\nAnswer: no",
