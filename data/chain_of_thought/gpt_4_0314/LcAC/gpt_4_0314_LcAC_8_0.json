The mummy was awake.\n\nWe are asked to determine if we can logically conclude that the vampire was awake.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: V -> M, where V represents the vampire being awake and M represents the mummy being awake. The second statement tells us that M is true.\n\nHowever, the given information does not provide a direct relationship between the mummy being awake and the vampire being awake. We only know that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. But we don't know if the mummy being awake necessarily means the vampire was awake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that the vampire was awake based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
