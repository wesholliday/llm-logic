The pants were denim.\n\nWe are asked to determine if we can logically conclude that the shirt was cotton.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A (shirt was cotton), then B (pants were denim). The second statement confirms that B is true (pants were denim).\n\nHowever, the given information does not provide a direct relationship between B and A. In other words, we cannot conclude that if B is true, then A must also be true. There could be other reasons for the pants being denim that are not related to the shirt being cotton.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that the shirt was cotton based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
