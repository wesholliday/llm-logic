Either the wug is sproinged or it is garpled.\nThis statement is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the wug is sproinged, or the wug is garpled.\n\n2. The wug is not garpled.\nThis statement negates one of the conditions in the disjunction, telling us that the wug is not garpled.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. Since the disjunction tells us that at least one of the conditions must be true, and we know that the wug is not garpled, the only remaining possibility is that the wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
