The flob is not movated.\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true (either the flob is skizzled or it is movated). The second statement tells us that the flob is not movated. Since we know that one of the conditions in the first statement must be true, and we know that the flob is not movated, we can infer that the flob must be skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
