Either the fribble is snurgled or it is crinked: This statement presents two possibilities for the fribble - it can be either snurgled or crinked. In logical terms, this can be represented as (snurgled OR crinked).\n\n2. The fribble is not crinked: This statement negates one of the possibilities presented in the first statement. In logical terms, this can be represented as (NOT crinked).\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n(snurgled OR crinked) AND (NOT crinked)\n\nSince we know that the fribble is not crinked, the only remaining possibility for the fribble is that it is snurgled. Therefore, we can infer that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
