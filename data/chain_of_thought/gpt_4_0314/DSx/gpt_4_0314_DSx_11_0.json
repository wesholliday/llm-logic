The flug is not zimmed.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n- Statement 1 tells us that there are two possibilities for the flug: it is either blummed or zimmed.\n- Statement 2 tells us that the flug is not zimmed.\n\nSince we know that the flug is not zimmed, and the only other possibility given in statement 1 is that the flug is blummed, we can infer that the flug must be blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
