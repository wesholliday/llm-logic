The splat is not quanked.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\nSince statement 1 is an \"either...or\" statement, it means that at least one of the two conditions must be true: the splat is morphed, or the splat is quanked.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the splat is not quanked. \n\nGiven that at least one of the conditions in statement 1 must be true, and we know from statement 2 that the splat is not quanked, we can infer that the other condition must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
