Either the whiffle is shanked or it is tinked.\nThis statement is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the whiffle is shanked, or it is tinked.\n\n2. The whiffle is not tinked.\nThis statement is a negation, which means that the condition of the whiffle being tinked is false.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements to see if we can infer that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nSince the first statement tells us that either the whiffle is shanked or it is tinked, and the second statement tells us that the whiffle is not tinked, we can conclude that the only remaining possibility is that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
