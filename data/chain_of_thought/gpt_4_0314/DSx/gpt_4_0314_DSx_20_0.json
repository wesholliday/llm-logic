In logical terms, this can be represented as (B \u2228 S), where B stands for \"bluttered\" and S stands for \"surned.\"\n\n2. \"The fleeg is not surned\" - This statement negates one of the possibilities presented in the first statement. In logical terms, this can be represented as (\u00acS), where \u00acS means \"not surned.\"\n\nNow, we want to infer if the fleeg is bluttered based on these two statements. Since we know that either the fleeg is bluttered or surned (B \u2228 S), and we also know that it is not surned (\u00acS), the only remaining possibility is that the fleeg is bluttered (B).\n\nAnswer: yes",
