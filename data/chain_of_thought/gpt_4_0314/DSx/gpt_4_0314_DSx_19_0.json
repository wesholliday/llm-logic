We have a statement that says \"Either the smonk is vreebled or it is plagged.\" This means that one of these two conditions must be true: the smonk is either vreebled or plagged.\n\n2. We also have another statement that says \"The smonk is not plagged.\" This means that the condition of the smonk being plagged is false.\n\nNow, since we know that one of the two conditions in the first statement must be true, and we know that the smonk being plagged is false, we can infer that the other condition, the smonk being vreebled, must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
