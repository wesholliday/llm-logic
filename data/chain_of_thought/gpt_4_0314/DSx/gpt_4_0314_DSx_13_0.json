The first statement is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true (either the glip is slogged or it is tragged).\n2. The second statement tells us that the glip is not tragged.\n\nSince the first statement tells us that at least one of the conditions must be true, and the second statement tells us that the glip is not tragged, we can infer that the only remaining possibility is that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
