The sneg is not sproted.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n- Statement 1 tells us that there are two possibilities for the sneg: it is either crampled or sproted.\n- Statement 2 tells us that the sneg is not sproted.\n\nSince we know that the sneg is not sproted, and the only other possibility given in statement 1 is that the sneg is crampled, we can infer that the sneg must be crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
