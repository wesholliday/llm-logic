Either the clug is fleeked or it is snugged.\nThis statement is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the clug is fleeked, or the clug is snugged.\n\n2. The clug is not snugged.\nThis statement negates one of the conditions in the disjunction, telling us that the clug is not snugged.\n\nNow, since we know that at least one of the conditions in the disjunction must be true, and we have established that the clug is not snugged, the only remaining possibility is that the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
