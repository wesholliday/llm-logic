The dreb is not spened.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\nSince statement 1 is an \"either-or\" statement, it means that one of the two conditions must be true: either the dreb is vroombed or it is spened.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the dreb is not spened.\n\nGiven that one of the conditions in statement 1 must be true, and we know from statement 2 that the dreb is not spened, we can infer that the other condition must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
