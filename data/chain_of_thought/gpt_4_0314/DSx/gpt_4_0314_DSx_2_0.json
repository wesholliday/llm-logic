Either the wug is flooped or it is bimmed: This statement tells us that there are two possibilities for the wug - it can be either flooped or bimmed. In logical terms, this can be represented as (F \u2228 B), where F stands for \"flooped\" and B stands for \"bimmed.\"\n\n2. The wug is not bimmed: This statement negates the possibility of the wug being bimmed. In logical terms, this can be represented as (\u00acB), where \u00acB stands for \"not bimmed.\"\n\nNow, we want to infer if the wug is flooped based on these two statements. Since we know that either the wug is flooped or it is bimmed (F \u2228 B), and we also know that the wug is not bimmed (\u00acB), we can use the logical rule of disjunction elimination (also known as the rule of constructive dilemma) to infer that the wug must be flooped (F).\n\nAnswer: yes",
