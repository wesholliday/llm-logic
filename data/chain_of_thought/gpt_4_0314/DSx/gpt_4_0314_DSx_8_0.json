The sprocket is not daggled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true (either the sprocket is cranked or it is daggled).\n\nStatement 2 negates one of the conditions in statement 1 (the sprocket is not daggled).\n\nSince statement 1 tells us that at least one of the conditions must be true, and statement 2 tells us that the sprocket is not daggled, we can infer that the other condition (the sprocket is cranked) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
