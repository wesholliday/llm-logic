The shank is not nugged.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\nStep 1: The first statement is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions (plooked or nugged) must be true for the shank.\n\nStep 2: The second statement tells us that the shank is not nugged.\n\nStep 3: Since the first statement requires that at least one of the conditions be true, and we know from the second statement that the shank is not nugged, the only remaining possibility is that the shank is plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
