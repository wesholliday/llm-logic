The twonk is not plinked.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true (either the twonk is plinked or it is varnished).\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the twonk is not plinked.\n\nSince we know that at least one of the conditions in Statement 1 must be true, and we know from Statement 2 that the twonk is not plinked, we can infer that the other condition must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
