The smip is not lupped.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\nStatement 1 is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the smip is shripped or the smip is lupped.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the smip is not lupped.\n\nSince we know that at least one of the conditions in Statement 1 must be true, and we know from Statement 2 that the smip is not lupped, we can infer that the smip must be shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
