In other words, it is possible that the shank was not plooked.\n\nNow, the question asks if we can infer \"The shank might not have been plooked\" from the given statement. This statement also means that it is possible that the shank was not plooked.\n\nSince both the given statement and the question express the same possibility (that the shank was not plooked), we can infer the statement in the question from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
