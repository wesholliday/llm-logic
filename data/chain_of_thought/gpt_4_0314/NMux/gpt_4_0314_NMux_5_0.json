In other words, there is a possibility that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nNow, let's look at the statement we want to infer: \"The zinger might not have been fraggled.\"\n\nThis statement is suggesting that there is a possibility that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nComparing the two statements, we can see that they both express the idea that it is not necessary for the zinger to have been fraggled, and there is a possibility that it was not fraggled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the second statement from the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
