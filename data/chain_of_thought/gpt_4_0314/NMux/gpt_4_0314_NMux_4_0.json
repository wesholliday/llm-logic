In other words, it is possible that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nNow, let's look at the statement we want to infer: \"The fribble might not have been snurgled.\" This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nComparing the two statements, we can see that both convey the idea that it is possible for the fribble not to be snurgled. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
