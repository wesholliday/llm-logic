In other words, it is saying that it is not necessary for the flugel to have been blimmed.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer: \"The flugel might not have been blimmed.\"\n\nThis statement is expressing the possibility that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nSince the original statement denies the necessity of the flugel being blimmed, it leaves open the possibility that the flugel was not blimmed. Therefore, we can infer the statement \"The flugel might not have been blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
