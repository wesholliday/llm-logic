In other words, it is possible that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer: \"The grommet might not have been sploffed.\" This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nComparing the two statements, we can see that they both express the same idea: there is no necessity for the grommet to have been sploffed, and it is possible that it was not sploffed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
