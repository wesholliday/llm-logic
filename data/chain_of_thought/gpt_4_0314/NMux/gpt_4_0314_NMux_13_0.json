In other words, it is possible that the glip was not slogged.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer: \"The glip might not have been slogged.\" This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the glip was not slogged.\n\nComparing the two statements, we can see that both convey the idea that it is possible for the glip not to have been slogged. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
