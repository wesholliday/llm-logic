In other words, it is saying that it is not necessarily true that the smip was shripped.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer: \"The smip might not have been shripped.\"\n\nThis statement is suggesting that there is a possibility that the smip was not shripped.\n\nSince the original statement denies the necessity of the smip being shripped, it leaves open the possibility that the smip might not have been shripped. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
