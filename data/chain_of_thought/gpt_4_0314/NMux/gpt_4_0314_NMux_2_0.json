In other words, it is possible that the wug was not flooped.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer: \"The wug might not have been flooped.\" This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the wug was not flooped.\n\nComparing the two statements, we can see that both convey the idea that it is possible for the wug not to be flooped. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
