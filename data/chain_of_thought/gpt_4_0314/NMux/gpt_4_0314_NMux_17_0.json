In other words, it is possible that the flob was not skizzled.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer: \"The flob might not have been skizzled.\" This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the flob was not skizzled.\n\nComparing the two statements, we can see that both convey the idea that it is possible for the flob not to be skizzled. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
