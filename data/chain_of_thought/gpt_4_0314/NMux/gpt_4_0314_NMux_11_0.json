In other words, it is possible that the flug was not blummed.\n\nNow, let's look at the statement we want to infer: \"The flug might not have been blummed.\" This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the flug was not blummed.\n\nComparing the two statements, we can see that both convey the same idea: there is no necessity for the flug to have been blummed, and it is possible that the flug was not blummed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
