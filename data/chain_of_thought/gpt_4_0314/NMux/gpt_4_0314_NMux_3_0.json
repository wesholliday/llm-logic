In other words, it is saying that it is not necessary for the splat to have been morphed.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer: \"The splat might not have been morphed.\"\n\nThis statement is suggesting the possibility that the splat was not morphed. It is not asserting that the splat was definitely not morphed, but rather that it is a possibility.\n\nGiven that the original statement negates the necessity of the splat being morphed, it leaves open the possibility that the splat was not morphed. Therefore, we can infer the statement \"The splat might not have been morphed\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
