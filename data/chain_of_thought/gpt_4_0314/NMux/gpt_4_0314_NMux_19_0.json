In other words, there is a possibility that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer: \"The smonk might not have been vreebled.\" This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nComparing the two statements, we can see that they both express the same idea: that there is a possibility that the smonk was not vreebled. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
