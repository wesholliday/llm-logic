However, we can still analyze the structure of the sentence to determine if the proposed inference can be made. The original statement says that the zibble must be wozzle with wobble and snizzle plimp. The proposed inference is that the zibble must be wozzle with wobble. Since the original statement includes the condition that the zibble must be wozzle with wobble, we can infer that the zibble must be wozzle with wobble, even though the meaning of these words is unclear.\n\nAnswer: yes",
