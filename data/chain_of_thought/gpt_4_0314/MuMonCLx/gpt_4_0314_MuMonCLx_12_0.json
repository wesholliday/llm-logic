If we remove \"gribble frazzle\" from the statement, we are left with \"The wibble must be quork by fizzle.\" However, this new statement suggests that only \"fizzle\" is necessary for the wibble to be quork, which is not the same as the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
