(where P = the wug was flooped, and Q = the wug bimmed the zoint)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer the following statement:\nIf the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped.\nThis can be represented as: If not Q, then not P.\n\nThis is the contrapositive of the given statement (If P, then Q). The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the given statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
