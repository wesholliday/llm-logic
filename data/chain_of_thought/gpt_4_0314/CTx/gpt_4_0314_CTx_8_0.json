            "content": "Let's break down the given statement and analyze it step by step:\n\n1. The given statement is \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\" or \"A \u2192 B\", where A is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and B is \"the sprocket was daggled.\"\n\n2. We want to infer \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\" This statement can be represented as \"If not B, then not A\" or \"\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA.\"\n\n3. The inference we are trying to make is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"A \u2192 B\" is \"\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA.\" In general, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if one is true, the other is also true.\n\n4. Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\" from \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
