The relationship between P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP is known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nSince the given statement is true, we can infer that its contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
