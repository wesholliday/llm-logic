(A = smip was shripped, B = smip lupped the zoint)\n\nNow, we need to determine if the following statement can be inferred: If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped.\nThis can be represented as: If not B, then not A. (not B = smip did not lup the zoint, not A = smip was not shripped)\n\nThe relationship between the given statement and the statement we need to infer is called the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the given statement, we can infer the statement \"If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
