The statement we need to infer is the contrapositive of the given statement (If not B, then not A). The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always true if the original statement is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the statement: If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
