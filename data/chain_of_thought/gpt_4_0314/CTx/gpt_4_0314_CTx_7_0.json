(where P = whiffle was shanked, Q = whiffle tinked)\n\nNow, we need to determine if the following statement can be inferred: If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked.\nThis can be represented as: If not Q, then not P. (where not Q = whiffle did not tink, not P = whiffle was not shanked)\n\nThe relationship between the given statement and the statement we need to infer is called the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" The contrapositive of a true statement is always true.\n\nSince the given statement is true, its contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
