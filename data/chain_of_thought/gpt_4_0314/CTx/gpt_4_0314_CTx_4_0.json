(where P = fribble was snurgled, and Q = fribble crinked)\n\nNow, we need to determine if the following statement can be inferred: If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled.\nThis can be represented as: If not Q, then not P.\n\nThis is the contrapositive of the given statement (If P, then Q). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, we can infer the statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
