(Premise 2)\n\nNow, we want to determine if the conclusion \"Ben did not eat pasta\" logically follows from these premises.\n\nWe can use the contrapositive form of the first premise to help us. The contrapositive of \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" is \"If Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\" The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nSince Premise 2 states that \"Kate did not eat salad,\" we can now apply the contrapositive: \"If Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\" This directly leads us to the conclusion that \"Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
