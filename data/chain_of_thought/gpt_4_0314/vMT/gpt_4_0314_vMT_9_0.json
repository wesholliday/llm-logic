(Not Q)\n\nNow, we want to determine if the conclusion \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" (Not P) logically follows from these premises.\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the consequent (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false. In other words, if we know that \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not Q\", we can conclude \"Not P\".\n\nIn this case, the argument follows the Modus Tollens form:\n\n1. If P (Lisa bought the red shirt), then Q (Mark bought the blue shirt).\n2. Not Q (Mark did not buy the blue shirt).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude:\n\nAnswer: yes",
