(Not B)\n\nNow, we want to determine if the conclusion \"The cake was not chocolate\" (Not A) logically follows from these premises.\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which can be represented as:\n\n1. If A, then B.\n2. Not B.\n3. Therefore, Not A.\n\nIn this case, A represents \"the cake was chocolate\" and B represents \"the muffins were blueberry.\" Since the argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
