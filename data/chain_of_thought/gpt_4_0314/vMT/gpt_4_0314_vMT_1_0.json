(Premise 2)\n\nNow, we want to determine if the conclusion \"Mary was not at the wedding\" logically follows from these premises.\n\nThis argument is an example of the logical form called modus tollens, which has the following structure:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\" The argument follows the modus tollens structure:\n\n1. If P (Mary was at the wedding), then Q (Sue was at the wedding).\n2. Not Q (Sue was not at the wedding).\n3. Therefore, not P (Mary was not at the wedding).\n\nSince modus tollens is a valid form of argument, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
