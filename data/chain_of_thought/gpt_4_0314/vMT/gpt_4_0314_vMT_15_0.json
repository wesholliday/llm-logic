(Premise 2)\n\nNow, we want to determine if the conclusion \"Sam did not take a plane\" logically follows from these premises.\n\nThis argument is an example of the logical form called Modus Tollens, which has the following structure:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P represents \"Sam took a plane\" and Q represents \"Erin took a train\". The argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens:\n\n1. If P (Sam took a plane), then Q (Erin took a train).\n2. Not Q (Erin did not take a train).\n3. Therefore, not P (Sam did not take a plane).\n\nSince Modus Tollens is a valid form of argument, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
