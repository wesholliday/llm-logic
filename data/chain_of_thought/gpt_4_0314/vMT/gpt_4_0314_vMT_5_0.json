(Premise 2)\n\nNow, we want to determine if the conclusion \"Jeff did not play basketball\" logically follows from these premises.\n\nThe argument is in the form of modus tollens, which is a valid argument form. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the negation of the consequent (not Q), we can conclude the negation of the antecedent (not P).\n\nIn this case:\n- P: Jeff played basketball\n- Q: Amy played tennis\n\nThe argument follows the modus tollens pattern:\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nSo, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
