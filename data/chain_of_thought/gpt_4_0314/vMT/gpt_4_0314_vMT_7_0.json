(Premise 2)\n\nNow, we want to determine if the conclusion \"Alex did not finish the race\" logically follows from these premises.\n\nThis argument is an example of the logical form called modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument, and it works like this:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P represents \"Alex finished the race\" and Q represents \"Chris finished the race.\" The argument follows the modus tollens form:\n\n1. If P (Alex finished the race), then Q (Chris finished the race).\n2. Not Q (Chris did not finish the race).\n3. Therefore, not P (Alex did not finish the race).\n\nSince modus tollens is a valid form of argument, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
