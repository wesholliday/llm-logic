(Not U)\n\nConclusion: The griffin was not in the forest. (Not G)\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. In modus tollens, if the consequent (U) is false, then the antecedent (G) must also be false. Since the second premise states that the unicorn was not in the forest (Not U), we can conclude that the griffin was not in the forest (Not G) as well.\n\nAnswer: yes",
