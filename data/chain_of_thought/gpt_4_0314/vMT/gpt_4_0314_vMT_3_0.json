(Not Q)\n\nNow, we want to determine if the conclusion, \"The book was not written by James\" (Not P), logically follows from the premises.\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which can be represented as:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Not Q\nConclusion: Not P\n\nIn this case, P represents \"the book was written by James\" and Q represents \"the book is a mystery novel.\" Since Modus Tollens is a valid form of argument, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
