(Premise 2)\n\nNow, we want to determine if the conclusion \"The dog was not inside\" logically follows from these premises.\n\nWe can use the contrapositive to help us understand the relationship between the premises. The contrapositive of the first premise is: If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside.\n\nComparing this contrapositive with the second premise, we can see that they share the same condition (The cat was not outside). Therefore, we can conclude that the dog was not inside.\n\nSo, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
