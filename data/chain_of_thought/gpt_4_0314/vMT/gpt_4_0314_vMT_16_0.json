(Not B)\n\nNow, we want to determine if the conclusion \"The shirt was not cotton\" (Not A) logically follows from the premises.\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which can be represented as:\n\n1. If A, then B.\n2. Not B.\n3. Therefore, Not A.\n\nIn this case, A represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and B represents \"the pants were denim.\" Since the argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
