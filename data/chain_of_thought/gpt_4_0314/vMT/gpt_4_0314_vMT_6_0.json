(Premise 2)\n\nNow, we want to determine if the conclusion \"Sue did not choose pizza\" logically follows from these premises.\n\nThe argument is in the form of a modus tollens, which is a valid argument form. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the negation of the consequent (Not Q), we can conclude the negation of the antecedent (Not P).\n\nIn this case:\n- P: Sue chose pizza\n- Q: Bob chose pasta\n\nThe argument can be represented as:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, Not P.\n\nSince modus tollens is a valid argument form, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
