(Not Q)\n\nNow we want to determine if the conclusion, \"The vampire was not awake\" (Not P), logically follows from the premises.\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not Q,\" we can conclude \"Not P.\" In this case, P represents \"the vampire was awake\" and Q represents \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\nSince the given argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
