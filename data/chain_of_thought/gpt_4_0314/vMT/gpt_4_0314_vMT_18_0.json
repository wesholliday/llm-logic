(Not Q)\n\nNow, we want to determine if the conclusion \"The doll was not plastic\" (Not P) logically follows from the premises.\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which can be represented as:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Not Q\nConclusion: Not P\n\nIn this case, P represents \"the doll was plastic\" and Q represents \"the truck was metal.\" Since the argument follows the Modus Tollens form, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
