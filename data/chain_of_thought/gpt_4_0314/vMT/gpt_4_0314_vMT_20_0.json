(Premise 2)\n\nNow, we want to determine if the conclusion \"The apple was not red\" logically follows from these premises.\n\nThis argument is an example of the logical form called modus tollens, which has the following structure:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P represents \"the apple was red\" and Q represents \"the banana was yellow.\" The argument follows the structure of modus tollens:\n\n1. If the apple was red (P), then the banana was yellow (Q).\n2. The banana was not yellow (not Q).\n3. Therefore, the apple was not red (not P).\n\nSince the argument follows the structure of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
