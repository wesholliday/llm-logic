The bear was not in the cave. (Conclusion)\n\nThis argument is an example of the logical form called modus tollens, which has the following structure:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P represents \"the bear was in the cave\" and Q represents \"the wolf was in the den.\" Since the argument follows the structure of modus tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
