(Premise 2)\n\nNow, we want to determine if the conclusion \"The car was not red\" logically follows from these premises.\n\nThe argument is in the form of a modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (if P, then Q) and the consequent (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\nIn this case, P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\" Since we know that Q is false (the truck was not blue), we can conclude that P is also false (the car was not red).\n\nSo, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
