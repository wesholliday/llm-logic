(Premise 2)\n\nNow, we want to determine if the conclusion \"Joe did not go to the park\" logically follows from these premises.\n\nThe argument is in the form of modus tollens, which is a valid argument form. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the negation of the consequent (not Q), we can conclude the negation of the antecedent (not P).\n\nIn this case:\n- P: Joe went to the park.\n- Q: Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nThe argument follows the modus tollens form:\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\nConclusion: Not P.\n\nSo, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
