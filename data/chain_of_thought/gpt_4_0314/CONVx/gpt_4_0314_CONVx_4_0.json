In this case, P is \"the fribble was snurgled\" and Q is \"the fribble crinked.\"\n\nNow, we are asked to infer if the following statement is true: \"If the fribble crinked, then the fribble was snurgled.\"\n\nThis statement can be represented as: If Q, then P.\n\nThe original statement (If P, then Q) does not guarantee that the reverse (If Q, then P) is true. It only tells us that if the fribble was snurgled, it crinked. It does not tell us that if the fribble crinked, it must have been snurgled. There could be other reasons for the fribble to crinkle.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot infer the reverse statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
