The given statement only tells us what happens when the splat is morphed, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the splat being morphed is the only way for it to quank. There could be other reasons for the splat to quank.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement 'If the splat quanked, then the splat was morphed' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
