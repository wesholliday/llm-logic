The given statement only tells us that vroombing leads to spening, but it does not tell us that spening must come from vroombing. There could be other ways for the dreb to be spened without being vroombed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was vroombed\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
