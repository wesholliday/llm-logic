In this case, P is \"the fleeg was bluttered\" and Q is \"it surned.\"\n\nNow, we are asked to infer if the following statement is true: \"If the fleeg surned, then it was bluttered.\"\n\nThis statement can be represented as: If Q, then P. In this case, Q is \"the fleeg surned\" and P is \"it was bluttered.\"\n\nThe original statement (If P, then Q) does not guarantee that the reverse statement (If Q, then P) is true. This is because there could be other reasons for the fleeg to surn, not just being bluttered.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If the fleeg surned, then it was bluttered\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
