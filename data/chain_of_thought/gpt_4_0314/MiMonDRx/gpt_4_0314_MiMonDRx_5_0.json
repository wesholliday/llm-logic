When we consider the new statement, \"The quimble might be blurble or quank,\" we are introducing an additional possibility (blurble) alongside the original possibility (quank). Since the original statement allows for the possibility of the quimble being quank, adding an extra possibility does not contradict or negate the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
