When we introduce another possibility, \"The zibber might be on the floob or on the wump,\" we are not contradicting the original statement, but rather expanding the range of possibilities. Since the original statement allows for the possibility of the zibber being on the wump, and the new statement also includes this possibility, we can infer the new statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
