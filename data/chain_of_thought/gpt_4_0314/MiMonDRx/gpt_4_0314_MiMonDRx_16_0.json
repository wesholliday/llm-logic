When we consider the new statement, \"The wobble might be shimble or snorkel,\" we are simply adding another possibility (shimble) to the existing possibility (snorkel). Since the original statement already allows for the possibility of the wobble being a snorkel, adding another possibility does not contradict or negate the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
