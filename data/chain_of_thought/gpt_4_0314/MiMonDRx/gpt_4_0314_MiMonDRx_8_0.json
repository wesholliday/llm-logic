When we consider the new statement, \"The quank might be wozzle or quorple,\" we are simply adding another possibility (wozzle) to the original statement. Since the original statement already allows for the possibility of the quank being quorple, adding another possibility (wozzle) does not contradict or negate the original statement. Therefore, we can infer the new statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
