When we consider the statement \"The blimple might be froodle or wibble,\" we are introducing an additional possibility (froodle) alongside the existing possibility (wibble). Since the original statement already allows for the possibility of the blimple being wibble, adding another possibility (froodle) does not contradict the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
