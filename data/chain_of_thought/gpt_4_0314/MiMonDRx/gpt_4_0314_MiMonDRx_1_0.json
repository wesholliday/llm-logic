The first statement says that \"The zibber might be flim a grazzle.\" The second statement presents two possibilities: \"The zibber might wibble a frazzle\" or \"The zibber might be flim a grazzle.\" Since the first statement already establishes that \"The zibber might be flim a grazzle,\" it is included as one of the possibilities in the second statement. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
