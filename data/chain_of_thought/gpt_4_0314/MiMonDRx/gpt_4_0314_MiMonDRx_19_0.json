The new statement suggests that the flonk might be frazzle or be grazzle, which means there is a possibility of the flonk being either frazzle or grazzle. Since the original statement already establishes the possibility of the flonk being grazzle, the new statement is consistent with the original statement, as it includes the possibility of the flonk being grazzle.\n\nAnswer: yes",
