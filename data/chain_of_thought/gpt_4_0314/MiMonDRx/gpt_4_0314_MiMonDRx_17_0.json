The new statement introduces another possibility: \"The zazzle might be quank snizzle or be flim frazzle.\" Since the original statement already established that the zazzle might be flim frazzle, adding another possibility (quank snizzle) does not contradict the original statement. Therefore, we can infer the new statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
