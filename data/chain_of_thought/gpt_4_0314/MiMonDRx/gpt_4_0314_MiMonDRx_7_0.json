Now, the question asks if we can infer that \"The glorp might be plonk or zizz.\" In this case, we are adding another possibility (plonk) to the original possibility (zizz). Since the original statement allows for the possibility of the glorp being zizz, adding another possibility (plonk) does not contradict the original statement and still includes the possibility of the glorp being zizz.\n\nAnswer: yes",
