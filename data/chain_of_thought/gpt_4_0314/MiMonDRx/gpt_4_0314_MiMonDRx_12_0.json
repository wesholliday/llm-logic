When we consider the statement \"The gronk might be zazzle or flimble,\" we are expanding the possibilities for what the gronk might be. Since the original statement already allows for the possibility of the gronk being flimble, adding another possibility (zazzle) does not contradict the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
