In logic, the word \"or\" is inclusive, meaning that if one of the statements is true, then the entire statement is true. Since we know that \"The wumble might zibber the flimble\" is true, the entire statement \"The wumble might floob the crunk or zibber the flimble\" is also true, regardless of whether \"The wumble might floob the crunk\" is true or not.\n\nAnswer: yes",
