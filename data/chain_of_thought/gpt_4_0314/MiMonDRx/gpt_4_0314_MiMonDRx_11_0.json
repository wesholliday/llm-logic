When we consider the new statement, \"The frazzle might be quork or snork,\" we are simply adding another possibility (quork) to the original possibility (snork). Since the original statement already allows for the possibility of the frazzle being snork, adding another possibility does not contradict or negate the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
