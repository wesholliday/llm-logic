Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information:\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that the watch isn't on his wrist, and statement 2 tells us that the watch is either charging on the dresser or on his wrist, we can infer that the watch must be charging on the dresser because the other option (on his wrist) has been ruled out.\n\nAnswer: yes",
