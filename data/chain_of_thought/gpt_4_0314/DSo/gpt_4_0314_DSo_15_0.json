Either the shoes are in the closet or they are lined up by the door.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the shoes are in the closet.\n\nSince statement 1 tells us that the shoes are not lined up by the door, and statement 2 tells us that the shoes are either in the closet or lined up by the door, we can conclude that the shoes must be in the closet because the other option (lined up by the door) has been ruled out by statement 1.\n\nAnswer: yes",
