Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it's under the bed.\n\nWe are asked if we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nSince we know that the missing sock isn't under the bed (from statement 1), and we also know that it must be either in the laundry basket or under the bed (from statement 2), the only remaining possibility is that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
