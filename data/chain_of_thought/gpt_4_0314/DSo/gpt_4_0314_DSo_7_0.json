Either the umbrella is in the car or it is tucked away in the closet.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information:\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that the umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet, and statement 2 tells us that the umbrella is either in the car or tucked away in the closet, we can infer that the umbrella must be in the car because the other option (tucked away in the closet) has been ruled out.\n\nAnswer: yes",
