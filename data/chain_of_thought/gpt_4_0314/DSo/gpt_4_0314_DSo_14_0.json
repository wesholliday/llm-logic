Either the milk is on the counter or it is chilling in the fridge.\n\nWe are asked if we can infer that \"The milk is on the counter\" from these statements.\n\nSince statement 1 tells us that the milk is not chilling in the fridge, and statement 2 tells us that the milk must be either on the counter or chilling in the fridge, we can conclude that the milk must be on the counter because it is not chilling in the fridge.\n\nAnswer: yes",
