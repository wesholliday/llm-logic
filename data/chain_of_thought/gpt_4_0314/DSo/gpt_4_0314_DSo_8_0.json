Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information:\n\nSince we know that the remote control isn't hiding under the couch (statement 1), and we also know that it must be either on the coffee table or hiding under the couch (statement 2), we can eliminate the possibility of it being under the couch.\n\nWith only one remaining option, we can infer that the remote control must be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
