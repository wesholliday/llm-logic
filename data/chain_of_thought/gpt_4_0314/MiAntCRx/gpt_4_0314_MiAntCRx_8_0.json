In this case, we are given the statement \"The blimp might snork.\" We are asked to infer if \"The blimp might zump and snork\" is true based on the given statement. Since we have no information about the blimp's ability to \"zump,\" we cannot infer that the blimp can do both actions (zump and snork) based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
