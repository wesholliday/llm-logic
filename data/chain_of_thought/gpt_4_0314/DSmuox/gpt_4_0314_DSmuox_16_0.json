It's not the case that the sneg must be sproted.\nThis can be represented as: \u00acS (where S stands for \"the sneg must be sproted\")\n\n2. Either the sneg is crampled or it must be sproted.\nThis can be represented as: C \u2228 S (where C stands for \"the sneg is crampled\" and S stands for \"the sneg must be sproted\")\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The sneg is crampled' (C) from these two statements.\n\nUsing the first statement (\u00acS), we know that the sneg must not be sproted. Since the second statement (C \u2228 S) tells us that either the sneg is crampled or it must be sproted, and we already know that it must not be sproted (\u00acS), the only remaining option is that the sneg is crampled (C).\n\nAnswer: yes",
