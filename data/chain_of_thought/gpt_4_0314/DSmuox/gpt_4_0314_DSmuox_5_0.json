It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled.\nThis can be represented as: \u00acS (where S stands for \"the zinger must be smoogled\")\n\n2. Either the zinger is fraggled or it must be smoogled.\nThis can be represented as: F \u2228 S (where F stands for \"the zinger is fraggled\")\n\nNow, we want to infer if the zinger is fraggled (F).\n\nSince we know \u00acS (it's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled) and we have F \u2228 S (either the zinger is fraggled or it must be smoogled), we can use the disjunction elimination rule. This rule states that if we have \u00acS and F \u2228 S, we can infer F.\n\nSo, using the disjunction elimination rule, we can infer that the zinger is fraggled (F).\n\nAnswer: yes",
