It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked.\nThis statement can be represented as \u00acT, where T stands for \"the whiffle must be tinked.\"\n\n2. Either the whiffle is shanked or it must be tinked.\nThis statement can be represented as S \u2228 T, where S stands for \"the whiffle is shanked\" and T stands for \"the whiffle must be tinked.\"\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The whiffle is shanked' (S) from these two statements.\n\nSince we know that \u00acT is true (from statement 1), we can use this information in statement 2:\n\nS \u2228 \u00acT\n\nSince \u00acT is true, the only way for the entire statement (S \u2228 \u00acT) to be true is if S is also true. Therefore, we can infer that the whiffle is shanked (S).\n\nAnswer: yes",
