It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped.\nThis can be represented as \u00acP (where P stands for \"the grommet must be plopped\").\n\n2. Either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped.\nThis can be represented as S \u2228 P (where S stands for \"the grommet is sploffed\" and \u2228 represents \"or\").\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The grommet is sploffed' (S) from these statements.\n\nUsing the first statement (\u00acP), we know that the grommet must not be plopped. Since the second statement (S \u2228 P) tells us that either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped, and we know it must not be plopped, the only remaining option is that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
