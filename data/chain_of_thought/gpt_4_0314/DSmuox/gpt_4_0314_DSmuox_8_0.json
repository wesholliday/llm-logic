It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled.\nThis can be represented as: \u00acD (where D stands for \"the sprocket must be daggled\")\n\n2. Either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled.\nThis can be represented as: C \u2228 D (where C stands for \"the sprocket is cranked\" and D stands for \"the sprocket must be daggled\")\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The sprocket is cranked' (C) from these statements.\n\nUsing the given information, we can apply the Disjunctive Syllogism rule, which states that if we have a disjunction (C \u2228 D) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false (\u00acD), then the other disjunct must be true.\n\nIn this case, we have C \u2228 D and \u00acD, so we can infer C (The sprocket is cranked).\n\nAnswer: yes",
