It's not the case that the glip must be tragged.\nThis can be represented as: \u00acT (where T stands for \"the glip must be tragged\")\n\n2. Either the glip is slogged or it must be tragged.\nThis can be represented as: S \u2228 T (where S stands for \"the glip is slogged\" and T stands for \"the glip must be tragged\")\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The glip is slogged' (S) from these statements.\n\nUsing the given information, we can apply the Disjunctive Syllogism rule, which states that if we have a disjunction (S \u2228 T) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false (\u00acT), then the other disjunct must be true (S).\n\nSince we have \u00acT and S \u2228 T, we can infer S (The glip is slogged) using the Disjunctive Syllogism rule.\n\nAnswer: yes",
