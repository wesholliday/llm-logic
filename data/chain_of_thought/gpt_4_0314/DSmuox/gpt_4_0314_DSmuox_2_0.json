It's not the case that the wug must be bimmed.\nThis can be represented as: \u00acB (where B stands for \"the wug must be bimmed\")\n\n2. Either the wug is flooped or it must be bimmed.\nThis can be represented as: F \u2228 B (where F stands for \"the wug is flooped\")\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The wug is flooped' (F) from these statements.\n\nUsing the given information, we can apply the Disjunctive Syllogism rule, which states that if we have a disjunction (F \u2228 B) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false (\u00acB), then the other disjunct must be true.\n\nSince we have F \u2228 B and \u00acB, we can infer F (The wug is flooped).\n\nAnswer: yes",
