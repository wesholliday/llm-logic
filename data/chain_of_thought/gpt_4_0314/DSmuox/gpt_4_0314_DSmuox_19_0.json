It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged.\nThis can be represented as: \u00acP (where P stands for \"the smonk must be plagged\")\n\n2. Either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged.\nThis can be represented as: V \u2228 P (where V stands for \"the smonk is vreebled\")\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"The smonk is vreebled\" (V) from these two statements.\n\nUsing the first statement (\u00acP), we can apply the Disjunctive Syllogism rule to the second statement (V \u2228 P). Disjunctive Syllogism states that if we have a disjunction (V \u2228 P) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false (\u00acP), then the other disjunct must be true (V).\n\nSo, since we know \u00acP and we have V \u2228 P, we can infer V.\n\nAnswer: yes",
