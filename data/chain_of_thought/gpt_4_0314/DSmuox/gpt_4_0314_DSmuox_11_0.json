It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed.\nThis statement can be represented as \u00acZ, where Z stands for \"the flug must be zimmed.\"\n\n2. Either the flug is blummed or it must be zimmed.\nThis statement can be represented as B \u2228 Z, where B stands for \"the flug is blummed\" and Z stands for \"the flug must be zimmed.\"\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"The flug is blummed\" (B) from these two statements.\n\nUsing the given information, we can apply the Disjunctive Syllogism rule, which states that if we have a disjunction (B \u2228 Z) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false (\u00acZ), then the other disjunct must be true.\n\nSince we know \u00acZ (It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed) and we have the disjunction B \u2228 Z (Either the flug is blummed or it must be zimmed), we can infer that B (The flug is blummed) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
