We can represent this as \u00acC (not crinked).\n\n2. \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked\" can be represented as S \u2228 C (snurgled or crinked).\n\nNow, we want to find out if we can infer \"The fribble is snurgled\" (S) from these two statements.\n\nSince we know \u00acC (not crinked) is true from statement 1, we can use this information in statement 2:\n\nS \u2228 \u00acC\n\nSince \u00acC is true, the only way for the entire statement to be true is if S (snurgled) is also true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
