It's not the case that the smip must be lupped.\nThis can be represented as: \u00acL (where L stands for \"the smip must be lupped\")\n\n2. Either the smip is shripped or it must be lupped.\nThis can be represented as: S \u2228 L (where S stands for \"the smip is shripped\")\n\nNow, we want to infer if \"The smip is shripped\" (S) is true based on these statements.\n\nUsing the first statement (\u00acL), we know that the smip must not be lupped. Since the second statement (S \u2228 L) tells us that either the smip is shripped or it must be lupped, and we already know that it must not be lupped, the only remaining option is that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
