It's not the case that the shank must be nugged.\nThis statement can be represented as \u00acN, where N stands for \"the shank must be nugged.\"\n\n2. Either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged.\nThis statement can be represented as P \u2228 N, where P stands for \"the shank is plooked.\"\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The shank is plooked' (P) from these two statements.\n\nUsing the given information, we can apply the Disjunctive Syllogism rule, which states that if we have P \u2228 N and \u00acN, then we can infer P.\n\nSince we have \u00acN (It's not the case that the shank must be nugged) and P \u2228 N (Either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged), we can infer P (The shank is plooked).\n\nAnswer: yes",
