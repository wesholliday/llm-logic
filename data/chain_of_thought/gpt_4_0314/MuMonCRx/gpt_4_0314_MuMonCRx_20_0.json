To infer that the snizzle must be zibble quank, we need to determine if the presence of wozzle affects the zibble quank part of the statement. Since the statement does not provide any information about the relationship between wozzle and zibble quank, we can infer that the snizzle must be zibble quank, as it is part of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
