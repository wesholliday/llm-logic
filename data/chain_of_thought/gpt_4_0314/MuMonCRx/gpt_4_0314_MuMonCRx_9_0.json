In order to infer if \"The quibble must be grooble,\" we need to determine if the statement provides enough information to conclude that the quibble has the property of being grooble.\n\nSince the original statement mentions that the quibble is both snork and grooble, we can infer that the quibble has the property of being grooble.\n\nAnswer: yes",
