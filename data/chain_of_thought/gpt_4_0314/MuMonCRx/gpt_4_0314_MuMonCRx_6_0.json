            "content": "Explanation: The original statement mentions that the crunk must be zibble snizzle and flimble at snorkel zibble. This means that there are three conditions for the crunk: it must be zibble snizzle, flimble, and at snorkel zibble. Since the question asks if we can infer that the crunk must be flimble at snorkel zibble, we can see that this is a part of the original statement. Therefore, we can infer this information from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
