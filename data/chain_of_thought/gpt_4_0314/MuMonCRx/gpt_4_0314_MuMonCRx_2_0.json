            "content": "Explanation: The original statement says that the quorple must be on the plonk and gribble a grazzle froodle. This means that there are two conditions that must be met: 1) the quorple must be on the plonk, and 2) the quorple must gribble a grazzle froodle. Since the second condition is the same as the statement we want to infer, we can conclude that if the original statement is true, then the inferred statement must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
