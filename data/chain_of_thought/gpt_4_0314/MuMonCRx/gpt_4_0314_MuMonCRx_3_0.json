This means that the quork is associated with both the wobble and the zibble wumble. However, it does not explicitly state that the quork must be zibble wumble. It only states that the quork is related to or part of the zibble wumble. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that the quork must be zibble wumble based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
