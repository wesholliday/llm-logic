Either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the fleeg is bluttered, or it must be surned. It doesn't tell us which one is true, just that one of them must be.\n\n2. The fleeg might not be surned.\nThis statement tells us that it's possible the fleeg is not surned. However, it doesn't confirm that the fleeg is definitely not surned.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer 'The fleeg is bluttered'?\n\nIf we knew for certain that the fleeg is not surned, then we could infer that the fleeg is bluttered, based on the first statement. However, the second statement only tells us that it's possible the fleeg is not surned, not that it definitely isn't. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nAnswer: no",
