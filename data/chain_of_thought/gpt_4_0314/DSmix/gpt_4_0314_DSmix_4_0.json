The fribble might not be crinked.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are two possibilities: the fribble is snurgled, or it is crinked. Statement 2 tells us that there is a possibility that the fribble is not crinked. However, it does not confirm that the fribble is definitely not crinked. Since we don't have enough information to rule out the possibility that the fribble is crinked, we cannot definitively infer that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: no",
