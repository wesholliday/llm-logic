The flug might not be zimmed.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are two possibilities: the flug is blummed or the flug is zimmed. Statement 2 tells us that there is a possibility that the flug is not zimmed. However, this does not guarantee that the flug is not zimmed; it only tells us that it might not be zimmed.\n\nSince we do not have enough information to definitively conclude that the flug is not zimmed, we cannot infer that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: no",
