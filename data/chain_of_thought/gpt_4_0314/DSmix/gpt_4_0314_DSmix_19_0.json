The smonk might not be plagged.\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged. The second statement implies that there is a possibility that the smonk is not plagged.\n\nSince there is a possibility that the smonk is not plagged, and we know from the first statement that at least one of the conditions must be true, we can infer that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
