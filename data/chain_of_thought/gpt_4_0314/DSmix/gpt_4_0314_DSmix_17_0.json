Either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated.\nThis statement tells us that there are two possibilities: the flob is skizzled, or the flob must be movated. It doesn't tell us which one is true, just that one of them must be.\n\n2. The flob might not be movated.\nThis statement tells us that it's possible that the flob is not movated. However, it doesn't tell us for certain that the flob is not movated, just that it's a possibility.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer 'The flob is skizzled'?\n\nIf we knew for certain that the flob is not movated, then we could infer that the flob is skizzled, since the first statement tells us that one of those two options must be true. However, the second statement only tells us that it's possible that the flob is not movated, not that it definitely isn't. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: no",
