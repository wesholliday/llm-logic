Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked.\nThis statement is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two parts must be true: either the splat is morphed, or it must be quanked.\n\n2. The splat might not be quanked.\nThis statement introduces uncertainty about whether the splat is quanked or not. It doesn't say that the splat is definitely not quanked, just that it's possible that it isn't.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer 'The splat is morphed'?\n\nSince the second statement only introduces the possibility that the splat is not quanked, it doesn't provide enough information to definitively conclude that the splat is morphed. It's still possible that the splat is quanked, which would satisfy the first statement without requiring the splat to be morphed.\n\nAnswer: no",
