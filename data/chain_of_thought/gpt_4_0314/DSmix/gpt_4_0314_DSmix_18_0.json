We can represent this as P \u2228 N (P or N).\n\n2. \"The shank might not be nugged\" - This statement suggests that it's possible that the shank is not nugged (\u00acN).\n\nNow, we want to infer if \"The shank is plooked\" (P) from these statements.\n\nSince we know that either P or N must be true (P \u2228 N), and we also know that it's possible that N is not true (\u00acN), we can infer that in the case where N is not true, P must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
