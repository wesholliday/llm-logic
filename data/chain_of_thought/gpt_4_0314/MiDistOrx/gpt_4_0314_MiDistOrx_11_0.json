This means that there is a possibility that the frazzle is blurble, and there is also a possibility that the frazzle is grooble. The rephrased statement, \"The frazzle might be blurble or it might be grooble,\" is essentially saying the same thing: there is a possibility for the frazzle to be either blurble or grooble.\n\nAnswer: yes",
