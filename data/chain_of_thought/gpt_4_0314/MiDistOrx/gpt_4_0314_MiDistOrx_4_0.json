This means that there are two possibilities: either the zibber frazzles at quazzle flimble, or it is quimble. The rephrased statement says that the zibber might frazzle at quazzle flimble, or it might be quimble. This also presents the same two possibilities. Therefore, the rephrased statement can be inferred from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
