When we add \"or plonk\" to the statement, we are simply expanding the range of possibilities for what the blurble might be. Since the original statement already establishes that the blurble might be wibble a frozz, adding another possibility (plonk) does not contradict or negate the original statement. Therefore, we can infer that \"The blurble might be wibble a frozz or plonk\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
