To infer this, we need to determine if the original statement allows for the possibility of the frazzle being wozzle or on flump. Since the original statement already states that the frazzle might be wozzle, adding the possibility of it being on flump does not contradict the original statement. Therefore, we can infer the new statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
