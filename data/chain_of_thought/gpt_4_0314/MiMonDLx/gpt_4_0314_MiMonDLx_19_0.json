When we consider the statement \"The zibble might be blimp or frozz,\" we are expanding the possibilities to include not only the possibility of the zibble being a blimp but also the possibility of it being a frozz. Since the original statement already allows for the possibility of the zibble being a blimp, adding an additional possibility (frozz) does not contradict the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
