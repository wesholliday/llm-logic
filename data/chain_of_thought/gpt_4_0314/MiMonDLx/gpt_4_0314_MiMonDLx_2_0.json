Now, we are asked if we can infer \"The blimple might be on the flump or in the wobble.\" This new statement presents two possibilities: the blimple being on the flump (which we know is possible) or the blimple being in the wobble. Since the first part of the new statement is already true, we can infer the entire statement as true, even without knowing anything about the second part (the blimple being in the wobble).\n\nAnswer: yes",
