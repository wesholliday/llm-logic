Now, we are asked if we can infer \"The zibber might be wozzle flim or quibble frazzle fribble.\" This new statement presents two possibilities: either the zibber is wozzle flim, which we know is a possibility from the original statement, or the zibber is quibble frazzle fribble. Since the original statement allows for the possibility of the zibber being wozzle flim, and the new statement includes that possibility along with an additional one, we can infer the new statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
