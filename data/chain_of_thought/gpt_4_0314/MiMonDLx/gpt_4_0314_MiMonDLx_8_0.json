Now, we are asked if we can infer \"The gribble might be quork or grazzle\" from the given statement. Since the given statement already establishes the possibility of the gribble being quork, adding another possibility (grazzle) to the statement does not negate or contradict the original statement. Therefore, we can infer the combined statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
