When we consider the statement \"The snork might be zazzle or quazzle,\" we are essentially expanding the possibilities for what the snork might be. Since the original statement already establishes that the snork might be zazzle, adding the possibility of it being quazzle does not contradict the original statement. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
