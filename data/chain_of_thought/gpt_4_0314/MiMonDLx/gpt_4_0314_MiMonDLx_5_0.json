When we consider the statement \"The zibble might be wozzle or snork,\" we are expanding the possibilities to include not only wozzle but also snork. Since the original statement already allows for the possibility of the zibble being wozzle, adding an additional possibility (snork) does not contradict or negate the original statement. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
