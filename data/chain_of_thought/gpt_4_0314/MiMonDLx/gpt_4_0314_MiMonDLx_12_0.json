When we consider the statement \"The snorkel might be flim or gronk,\" we are essentially expanding the possibilities for the snorkel. Since the snorkel might be flim, and we are adding another possibility (gronk), the statement \"The snorkel might be flim or gronk\" is also true, as it includes the original possibility of the snorkel being flim.\n\nAnswer: yes",
