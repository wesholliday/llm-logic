Now, we are asked if we can infer \"The snork might be plonk or wobble\" from the given statement. Since the given statement already establishes the possibility of the snork being plonk, adding \"or wobble\" to the statement does not negate or contradict the original statement. It simply introduces an additional possibility (wobble) for the snork.\n\nAnswer: yes",
