(Premise 2)\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion: Tom did not watch football.\n\nThe argument is trying to establish that if Jen might not have watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football. This is the contrapositive of the first premise, which states that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement (If P, then Q) is the statement (If not Q, then not P). In this case, the contrapositive would be: If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\n\nHowever, the second premise only states that Jen might not have watched basketball, not that she definitely did not watch basketball. This means that we cannot definitively conclude that Tom did not watch football based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
