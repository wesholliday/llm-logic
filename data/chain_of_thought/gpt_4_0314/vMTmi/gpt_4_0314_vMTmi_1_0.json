(Premise 2)\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion: Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nThe argument is trying to establish that if Sue might not have been at the wedding, then Mary must not have been at the wedding. This is because if Mary were at the wedding, Sue would have to be there as well, according to Premise 1.\n\nIn other words, the argument is using the contrapositive form of the first premise. The contrapositive of \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" is \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nHowever, Premise 2 only states that Sue might not have been at the wedding, not that she definitely was not there. Therefore, we cannot draw a definitive conclusion about Mary's attendance based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
