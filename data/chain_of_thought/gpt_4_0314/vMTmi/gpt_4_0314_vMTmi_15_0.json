Sam did not take a plane. (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument is trying to establish that if there is a possibility that Erin did not take a train, then Sam must not have taken a plane. In other words, it is trying to establish the contrapositive of the first premise.\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the contrapositive would be \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\"\n\nHowever, the second premise only states that Erin might not have taken a train, not that she definitely did not take a train. This means that we cannot establish the contrapositive with certainty, and therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
