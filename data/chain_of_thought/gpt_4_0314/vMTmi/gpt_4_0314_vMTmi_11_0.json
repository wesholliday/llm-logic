The muffins might not have been blueberry. (Possibility of not B)\n\nNow, we need to determine if the conclusion \"The cake was not chocolate\" (not A) logically follows from these premises.\n\nIn a logically valid argument, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. In this case, the second premise only states that there is a possibility that the muffins were not blueberry, but it does not confirm that they were not blueberry. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the cake was not chocolate based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
