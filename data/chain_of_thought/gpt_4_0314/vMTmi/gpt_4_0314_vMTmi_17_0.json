(Premise 2)\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion: Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the consequent (Kate must have eaten salad) must also be true. However, the second premise states that it is possible that Kate did not eat salad. This means that the antecedent (Ben ate pasta) cannot be true, because if it were, then the consequent (Kate must have eaten salad) would also have to be true, which contradicts the second premise.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion (Ben did not eat pasta) follows logically from the premises, making the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
