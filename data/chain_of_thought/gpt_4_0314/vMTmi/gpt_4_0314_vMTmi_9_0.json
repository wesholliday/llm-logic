Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. (Premise 2)\n3. Lisa did not buy the red shirt. (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument is in the form of a modus tollens, which is a valid argument form. In modus tollens, if we have a conditional statement (if P, then Q) and the negation of the consequent (not Q), we can conclude the negation of the antecedent (not P).\n\nIn this case:\n- P: Lisa bought the red shirt\n- Q: Mark bought the blue shirt\n\nPremise 1 is the conditional statement (if P, then Q), and Premise 2 is the negation of the consequent (not Q). Therefore, we can conclude the negation of the antecedent (not P), which is 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\n\nSo, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
