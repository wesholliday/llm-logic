(Premise 2)\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion: The car was not red.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the car was red) is true, then the consequent (the truck must have been blue) must also be true. However, the second premise only states that the truck might not have been blue, which means there is a possibility that the truck was not blue, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the truck was not blue.\n\nSince the second premise doesn't provide enough information to determine whether the truck was blue or not, we cannot conclude that the car was not red based on the given premises. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
