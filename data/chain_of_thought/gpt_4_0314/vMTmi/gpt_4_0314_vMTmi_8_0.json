(Possibility of not B)\n\nNow, we need to determine if the conclusion \"The vampire was not awake\" (not A) logically follows from these premises.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement (If A, then B). The second premise introduces the possibility of not B. In order to determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion (not A) necessarily follows from these premises.\n\nIn this case, if we know that \"If A, then B\" and we also know that there is a possibility of not B, we can infer that there is a possibility of not A. However, this does not guarantee that not A is true, only that it is a possibility.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid, as the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
