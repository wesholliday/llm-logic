(Premise 2)\n\nNow, we need to determine if the conclusion \"Alex did not finish the race\" logically follows from these premises.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Alex finishing the race) is true, then the consequent (Chris finishing the race) must also be true. However, the second premise states that it's possible that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nIf it's possible that Chris did not finish the race, then it must be the case that Alex did not finish the race, because if Alex had finished the race, then Chris would have to finish the race according to the first premise. Since this contradicts the second premise, the only logical conclusion is that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
