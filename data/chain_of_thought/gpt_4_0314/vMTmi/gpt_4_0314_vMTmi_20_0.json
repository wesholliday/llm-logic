(Premise 2)\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion: The apple was not red.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the apple was red) is true, then the consequent (the banana must have been yellow) must also be true. However, the second premise introduces uncertainty about the consequent (the banana might not have been yellow).\n\nIn order to determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion (the apple was not red) does not necessarily follow from the premises, because the second premise only introduces doubt about the consequent, but does not definitively prove that the antecedent (the apple was red) is false.\n\nAnswer: no",
