The unicorn might not have been in the forest. (Possibly not U)\n\nNow, we need to determine if the conclusion \"The griffin was not in the forest\" (not G) follows logically from these premises.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement (If G, then U). The second premise states that it's possible that the unicorn was not in the forest. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that the unicorn was definitely not in the forest. It just means that there's a possibility that it wasn't.\n\nIn order to conclude that the griffin was not in the forest, we would need to know for certain that the unicorn was not in the forest. Since the second premise only states that it's possible that the unicorn wasn't in the forest, we cannot definitively conclude that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no",
