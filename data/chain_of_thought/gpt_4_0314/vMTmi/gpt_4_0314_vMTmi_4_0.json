(Premise 2)\n\nConclusion: The alien did not visit Mars.\n\nThe argument is trying to establish a relationship between the alien visiting Mars and the robot visiting Jupiter. Premise 1 is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the alien visiting Mars) is true, then the second part (the robot visiting Jupiter) must also be true.\n\nPremise 2 introduces uncertainty about the robot visiting Jupiter. However, this uncertainty does not necessarily mean that the robot did not visit Jupiter. It just means that it's possible that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion states that the alien did not visit Mars. However, based on the premises, we cannot definitively conclude that the alien did not visit Mars. The uncertainty in Premise 2 does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion about the alien's visit to Mars.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: no",
