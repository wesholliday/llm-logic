(Premise 2)\n3. The doll was not plastic. (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument is trying to establish a relationship between the doll being plastic and the truck being metal. The first premise states that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. The second premise introduces uncertainty about the truck being metal.\n\nHowever, the conclusion that the doll was not plastic does not necessarily follow from the premises. The second premise only states that the truck might not have been metal, not that it definitely wasn't. It is still possible that the truck was metal and the doll was plastic, which would be consistent with the first premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
