(Premise 2)\n3. The shirt was not cotton. (Conclusion)\n\nThis argument is an example of the logical form called Modus Tollens. Modus Tollens is a valid form of argument, and it works as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q represents \"the pants must have been denim.\" However, the second premise does not state that the pants were definitely not denim, only that they might not have been denim. This means that the second premise is not a clear negation of Q, and therefore, the argument does not strictly follow the Modus Tollens form.\n\nAnswer: no",
