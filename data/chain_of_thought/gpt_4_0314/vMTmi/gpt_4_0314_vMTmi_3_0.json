            "content": "Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel. (Premise 1)\n2. The book might not be a mystery novel. (Premise 2)\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion:\n\n3. The book was not written by James. (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument is trying to establish that if the book might not be a mystery novel, then it must not have been written by James. This is an example of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens states that if P implies Q, and not Q is true, then not P must also be true.\n\nIn this case, P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book must be a mystery novel.\" Premise 2 states that not Q might be true (the book might not be a mystery novel). Therefore, if not Q might be true, then not P (the book was not written by James) might also be true.\n\nHowever, the conclusion states that the book was not written by James as a definite fact, while the second premise only states that the book might not be a mystery novel. The conclusion is not fully supported by the premises, as there is still a possibility that the book is a mystery novel and was written by James.\n\nSo, the form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
