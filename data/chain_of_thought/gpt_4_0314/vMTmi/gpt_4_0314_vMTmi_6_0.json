(Premise 2)\n\nConclusion: Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nThe argument is a form of modus tollens, which is a valid argument form. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (if P, then Q) and we know that Q is false, then we can conclude that P is also false.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\" The second premise states that \"Bob might not have chosen pasta,\" which implies that it's possible that the consequent (Bob choosing pasta) is false. Since it's possible that the consequent is false, we can conclude that the antecedent (Sue choosing pizza) is also possibly false.\n\nSo, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
