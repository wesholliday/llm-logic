The truck was metal.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the doll was plastic.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If P (doll is plastic), then Q (truck is metal). The second statement confirms that Q (truck is metal) is true.\n\nHowever, we cannot logically infer that P (doll is plastic) is true just because Q (truck is metal) is true. The conditional statement only tells us that if P is true, then Q must be true. It does not tell us that if Q is true, then P must be true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that the doll was plastic based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
