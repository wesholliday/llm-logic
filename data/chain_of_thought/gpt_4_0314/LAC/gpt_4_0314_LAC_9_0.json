Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure. The first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\n\nIf A (Lisa bought the red shirt), then B (Mark bought the blue shirt).\n\nThe second statement confirms that B (Mark bought the blue shirt) is true. However, this does not necessarily mean that A (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true. The original conditional statement only tells us that if A is true, then B must be true. It does not tell us that if B is true, then A must be true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that Lisa bought the red shirt based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
