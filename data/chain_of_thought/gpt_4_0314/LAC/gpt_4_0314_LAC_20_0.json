If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A (apple was red), then B (banana was yellow).\n\n2. The banana was yellow.\nThis statement is a fact, which can be represented as: B (banana was yellow).\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can logically infer that the apple was red (A) from these two statements.\n\nThe given conditional statement (If A, then B) tells us that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. However, it does not tell us that the apple being red is the only condition for the banana being yellow. In other words, the banana being yellow could be true even if the apple was not red.\n\nSince we only know that the banana was yellow (B), we cannot definitively conclude that the apple was red (A) based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
