The first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\n\nSue chose pizza (P) \u2192 Bob chose pasta (Q)\n\nThe second statement is a fact:\n\nBob chose pasta (Q)\n\nWe are asked if we can logically infer that Sue chose pizza (P) from these two statements. In other words, we want to know if the following is true:\n\nQ \u2192 P\n\nHowever, the given information does not allow us to make this inference. The first statement tells us that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. But it does not tell us that if Bob chose pasta, then Sue must have chosen pizza. It is possible that Bob chose pasta for some other reason, and Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that Sue chose pizza from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
