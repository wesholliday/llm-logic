If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A, then B. Here, A represents the alien visiting Mars, and B represents the robot visiting Jupiter.\n\n2. The robot visited Jupiter.\nThis statement tells us that B is true.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can logically infer that A (the alien visited Mars) is true based on the given information.\n\nIn a conditional statement, if A is true, then B must be true. However, knowing that B is true does not necessarily mean that A is true. There could be other reasons for B being true that are not related to A.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot logically infer that the alien visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: no",
