If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A, then C (where A represents Alex finishing the race, and C represents Chris finishing the race).\n\n2. Chris finished the race.\nThis statement can be represented as: C.\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can logically infer that Alex finished the race (A) from these two statements.\n\nThe first statement (If A, then C) tells us that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race. However, it does not tell us what happens if Chris finishes the race without any information about Alex.\n\nThe second statement (C) tells us that Chris finished the race, but it does not provide any information about whether Alex finished the race or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that Alex finished the race (A) from these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
