The book is a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure. The first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\n\nJames \u2192 Mystery\n\nwhere \"James\" represents \"the book was written by James\" and \"Mystery\" represents \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nThe second statement is a simple statement:\n\nMystery\n\nTo infer \"The book was written by James,\" we would need to establish a logical connection between the two statements. However, the given statements only tell us that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. It does not tell us that James is the only author who writes mystery novels.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that the book was written by James just because it is a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: no",
