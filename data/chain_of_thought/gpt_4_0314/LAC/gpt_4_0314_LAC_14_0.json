If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A (bear in the cave), then B (wolf in the den).\n\n2. The wolf was in the den.\nThis statement is a fact, which can be represented as: B (wolf in the den).\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can logically infer A (bear in the cave) from these statements.\n\nThe given conditional statement (If A, then B) tells us that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf must be in the den. However, it does not tell us that the bear being in the cave is the only condition for the wolf to be in the den. In other words, the wolf could be in the den for other reasons as well.\n\nSince we only know that the wolf is in the den (B), we cannot definitively conclude that the bear was in the cave (A) based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
