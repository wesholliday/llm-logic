Jen watched basketball.\n\nWe are asked to determine if we can logically infer that Tom watched football.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A, then B. In this case, A represents \"Tom watched football\" and B represents \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nThe second statement tells us that B is true (Jen watched basketball).\n\nHowever, knowing that B is true does not necessarily mean that A is true. The conditional statement only tells us that if A is true, then B must be true. It does not tell us that if B is true, then A must be true. This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that Tom watched football just because Jen watched basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
