Erin took a train (Q)\n\nWe are asked to determine if we can logically infer that Sam took a plane (P).\n\nThe given information is an example of the logical form called \"affirming the consequent.\" This form is a logical fallacy, meaning it is not a valid form of reasoning. Just because the consequent (Q) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (P) is true.\n\nFor example, there could be other reasons why Erin took a train, unrelated to whether Sam took a plane or not.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot logically infer that Sam took a plane.\n\nAnswer: no",
