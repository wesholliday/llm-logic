If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A (car is red), then B (truck is blue).\n\n2. The truck was blue.\nThis statement is a fact, which means B (truck is blue) is true.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can logically infer that the car was red (A) from these statements.\n\nThe conditional statement (If A, then B) tells us that if the car is red, the truck must be blue. However, it does not tell us that the car being red is the only condition for the truck being blue. In other words, the truck being blue does not necessarily mean the car must be red.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that the car was red just because the truck was blue.\n\nAnswer: no",
