The first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\n\nIf P (Jeff played basketball), then Q (Amy played tennis).\n\nThe second statement is a simple statement:\n\nQ (Amy played tennis).\n\nWe are asked to infer if P (Jeff played basketball) is true. However, the given statements do not provide enough information to conclude that P is true. The first statement only tells us that if P is true, then Q is true. It does not tell us that if Q is true, then P must be true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that Jeff played basketball based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
