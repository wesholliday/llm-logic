The muffins were blueberry.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure of these statements. The first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\n\nIf A (cake was chocolate), then B (muffins were blueberry).\n\nThe second statement is a simple statement:\n\nB (muffins were blueberry).\n\nTo infer that the cake was chocolate (A), we would need to show that A implies B and B is true, so A must be true. However, the given statements only show that if A is true, then B is true, and that B is true. This does not necessarily mean that A is true. It is possible that the muffins were blueberry for some other reason, and the cake was not chocolate.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that the cake was chocolate based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
