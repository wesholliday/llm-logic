Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A (Joe went to the park), then B (Lucy went to the zoo). This means that if A is true, then B must also be true. However, it does not guarantee that if B is true, then A must also be true.\n\nThe second statement tells us that B (Lucy went to the zoo) is true. But we cannot infer from this information alone that A (Joe went to the park) is true, because the conditional statement only guarantees that if A is true, then B is true, not the other way around.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that Joe went to the park based on the given information. \n\nAnswer: no",
