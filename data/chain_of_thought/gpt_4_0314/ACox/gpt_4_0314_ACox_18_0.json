If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n\nWe are asked to infer if \"The sprocket was cranked\" is true based on these statements.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the sprocket was cranked) is true, then the second part (the sprocket was daggled) must also be true. However, this does not mean that if the second part is true, the first part must also be true.\n\nIn this case, we know that the sprocket was daggled, but we cannot infer that the sprocket was cranked based on the given information. The sprocket could have been daggled for other reasons.\n\nAnswer: no",
