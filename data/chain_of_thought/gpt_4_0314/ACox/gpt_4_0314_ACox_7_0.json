If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the whiffle was shanked.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the whiffle was shanked) is true, then the second part (the whiffle tinked) must also be true. However, this does not mean that if the second part is true, the first part must also be true.\n\nIn this case, we know that the whiffle tinked, but we do not have enough information to determine if the whiffle was shanked. The whiffle could have tinked for other reasons not mentioned in the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
