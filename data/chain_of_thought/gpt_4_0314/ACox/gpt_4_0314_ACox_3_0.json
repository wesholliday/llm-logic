If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\n\nWe are asked to infer if \"The splat was morphed\" is true based on the given information.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the splat was morphed) is true, then the result (the splat quanked) must also be true. However, this does not mean that the result can only happen if the condition is true. In other words, the splat quanking could happen for other reasons besides it being morphed.\n\nSince we only know that the splat quanked, but we don't have any information about whether it was morphed or not, we cannot infer that \"The splat was morphed\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
