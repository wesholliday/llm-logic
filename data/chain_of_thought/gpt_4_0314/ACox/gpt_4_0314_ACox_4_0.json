If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\n\nWe are asked to infer if \"The fribble was snurgled\" from these statements.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the fribble was snurgled) is true, then the second part (the fribble crinked) must also be true. However, this does not mean that if the second part is true, the first part must also be true.\n\nIn this case, we know that the fribble crinked, but we do not have enough information to determine if the fribble was snurgled. The fribble could have crinked for other reasons not mentioned in the given statements.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The fribble was snurgled\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
