If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\n\nWe are asked to infer if \"The flugel was blimmed\" is true based on these statements.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means if the first part (the flugel was blimmed) is true, then the second part (the flugel was zargled) must also be true. However, this does not mean that if the second part is true, the first part must also be true.\n\nIn this case, we know that the flugel was zargled (from statement 1), but we cannot infer that the flugel was blimmed based on the given information. The conditional statement does not provide enough information to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
