If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the sprocket was cranked. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the sprocket was cranked) is true, then the second part (the sprocket was daggled) must also be true. However, knowing that the sprocket was daggled does not necessarily mean that it was cranked, as there could be other reasons for it being daggled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the sprocket was cranked based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
