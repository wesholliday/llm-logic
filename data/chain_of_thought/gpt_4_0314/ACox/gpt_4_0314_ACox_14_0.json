If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble was crinked.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the fribble was snurgled.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the fribble was snurgled) is true, then the second part (the fribble was crinked) must also be true. However, knowing that the fribble was crinked does not necessarily mean that the fribble was snurgled, as there could be other reasons for the fribble being crinked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the fribble was snurgled based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
