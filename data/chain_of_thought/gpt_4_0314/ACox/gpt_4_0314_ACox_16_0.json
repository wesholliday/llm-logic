If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet was plopped.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the grommet was sploffed. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means if the first part (the grommet was sploffed) is true, then the second part (the grommet was plopped) must also be true. However, we only know that the grommet was plopped, and we don't have any information about whether the grommet was sploffed or not.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the grommet was sploffed.\n\nAnswer: no",
