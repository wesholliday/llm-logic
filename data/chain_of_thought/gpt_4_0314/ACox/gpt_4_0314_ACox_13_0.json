If the splat was morphed, then the splat was quanked.\n\nWe are asked to infer if \"The splat was morphed.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means if the first part (the splat was morphed) is true, then the second part (the splat was quanked) must also be true. However, we only know that the splat was quanked, and this does not necessarily mean that the splat was morphed. There could be other reasons for the splat being quanked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The splat was morphed\" based on the given information. \n\nAnswer: no",
