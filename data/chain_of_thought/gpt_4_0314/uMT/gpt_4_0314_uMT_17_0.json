(This is the negation of Q: not Q)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta (not P).\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite the conditional statement as follows:\n\nIf not Q, then not P.\n\nSo, if Kate did not eat salad (not Q), then Ben did not eat pasta (not P).\n\nSince we know that Kate did not eat salad (not Q), we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta (not P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
