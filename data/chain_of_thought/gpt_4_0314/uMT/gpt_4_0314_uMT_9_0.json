Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's think step by step:\n\nIf we assume that Lisa bought the red shirt, then according to statement 1, Mark must have bought the blue shirt. However, statement 2 tells us that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This means that our assumption that Lisa bought the red shirt must be incorrect, because it leads to a contradiction with the given information.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
