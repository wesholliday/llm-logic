The muffins were not blueberry.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements. Statement 1 is a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\n\nChocolate Cake \u2192 Blueberry Muffins\n\nStatement 2 is a negation of the consequent (Blueberry Muffins) in Statement 1:\n\n\u00acBlueberry Muffins\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically the contrapositive, if we negate both the antecedent (Chocolate Cake) and the consequent (Blueberry Muffins) and reverse their order, the statement remains true:\n\n\u00acBlueberry Muffins \u2192 \u00acChocolate Cake\n\nSince we know that the muffins were not blueberry (\u00acBlueberry Muffins), we can infer that the cake was not chocolate (\u00acChocolate Cake).\n\nAnswer: yes",
