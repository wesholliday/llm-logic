(This is the negation of Q: not Q)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball (not P).\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite the conditional statement as follows: If not Q, then not P. In this case, if Amy did not play tennis (not Q), then Jeff did not play basketball (not P).\n\nSince we know that Amy did not play tennis (not Q), we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball (not P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
