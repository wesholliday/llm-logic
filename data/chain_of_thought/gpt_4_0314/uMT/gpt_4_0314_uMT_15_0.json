Erin did not take a train.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information:\n\nIf Sam took a plane, then according to statement 1, Erin must have taken a train. However, statement 2 tells us that Erin did not take a train. This means that the condition for statement 1 (Sam taking a plane) cannot be true, because if it were true, then Erin would have taken a train, which contradicts statement 2.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
