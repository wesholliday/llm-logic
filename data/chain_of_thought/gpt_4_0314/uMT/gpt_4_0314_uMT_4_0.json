(Not B)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars (Not A).\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can reverse and negate the first statement:\n\n1. If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars. (If not B, then not A)\n\nSince the second statement says that the robot did not visit Jupiter (Not B), we can now infer that the alien did not visit Mars (Not A) based on the contrapositive of the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
