The cat was not outside.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the dog is inside, the cat must be outside. However, statement 2 tells us that the cat is not outside. Since the cat is not outside, it means that the condition for the dog being inside is not met. Therefore, we can infer that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
