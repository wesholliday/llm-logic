The unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the griffin being in the forest) is true, then the second part (the unicorn being in the forest) must also be true.\n\nHowever, the second statement tells us that the unicorn was not in the forest. Since the first statement implies that the griffin being in the forest would mean the unicorn is also in the forest, and we know the unicorn was not in the forest, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
