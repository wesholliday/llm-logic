Lucy did not go to the zoo. (This is the negation of B: not B)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that Joe did not go to the park (not A).\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can say that if not B, then not A. Since we know that Lucy did not go to the zoo (not B), we can infer that Joe did not go to the park (not A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
