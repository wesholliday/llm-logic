Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nNow, let's think step by step:\n\nIf Sue chose pizza, then according to statement 1, Bob must have chosen pasta. However, statement 2 tells us that Bob did not choose pasta. This means that the condition for statement 1 (Sue choosing pizza) cannot be true, because if it were true, it would lead to a contradiction with statement 2.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
