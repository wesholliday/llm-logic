The first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\n\nCotton Shirt \u2192 Denim Pants\n\nThe second statement tells us that the pants were not denim. So, we have:\n\n\u00acDenim Pants\n\nWe want to know if we can infer that the shirt was not cotton, which can be represented as:\n\n\u00acCotton Shirt\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can reverse and negate the conditional statement:\n\n\u00acDenim Pants \u2192 \u00acCotton Shirt\n\nSince we know that the pants were not denim (\u00acDenim Pants), we can infer that the shirt was not cotton (\u00acCotton Shirt).\n\nAnswer: yes",
