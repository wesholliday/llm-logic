Chris did not finish the race.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that Alex finishing the race is a necessary condition for Chris to finish the race. In other words, if Chris finished the race, then Alex must have finished the race as well.\n\nHowever, statement 2 tells us that Chris did not finish the race. Since Alex finishing the race is a necessary condition for Chris to finish, and we know that Chris did not finish, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race either.\n\nAnswer: yes",
