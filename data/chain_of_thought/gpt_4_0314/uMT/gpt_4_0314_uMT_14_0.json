(Not W)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer that the bear was not in the cave (Not B).\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 1 as:\n\n1. If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave. (If Not W, then Not B)\n\nNow, we can see that statement 2 (Not W) matches the condition in the contrapositive of statement 1 (If Not W, then Not B). Therefore, we can infer that the bear was not in the cave (Not B).\n\nAnswer: yes",
