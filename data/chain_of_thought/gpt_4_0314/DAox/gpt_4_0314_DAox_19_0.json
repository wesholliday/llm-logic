If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\n\nWe are asked to infer if \"The smonk was not plagged\" from these statements.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (smonk being vreebled) is true, then the result (smonk plagging) must also be true. However, the first statement tells us that the smonk was not vreebled. Since the condition is false, we cannot determine the truth value of the result (smonk plagging) based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The smonk was not plagged\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
