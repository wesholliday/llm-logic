If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\n\nWe are asked to infer if \"The fleeg did not surn\" is true based on these statements.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the fleeg was bluttered) is true, then the result (it surned) must also be true. However, the first statement tells us that the condition (the fleeg was bluttered) is false.\n\nSince the condition is false, the conditional statement does not provide any information about whether the fleeg surned or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The fleeg did not surn\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
