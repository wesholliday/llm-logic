In this case, A is \"the sneg was crampled\" and B is \"the sneg sproted the frink.\"\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"The sneg did not sprot the frink\" from the given information.\n\nSince we know that the sneg was not crampled (A is false), we cannot directly conclude anything about whether the sneg sproted the frink (B) based on the conditional statement. The statement only tells us what would happen if the sneg was crampled, but it doesn't tell us what happens when the sneg is not crampled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The sneg did not sprot the frink\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
