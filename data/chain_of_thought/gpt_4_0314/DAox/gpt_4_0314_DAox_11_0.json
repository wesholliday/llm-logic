If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\n\nWe are asked to infer if 'The flug was not zimmed' from these statements.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the flug was blummed) is true, then the result (the flug was zimmed) must also be true. However, the first statement tells us that the flug was not blummed. Since the condition is not true, we cannot infer anything about the result (whether the flug was zimmed or not) from the second statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The flug was not zimmed' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
