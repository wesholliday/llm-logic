If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated.\n\nWe are asked to infer if 'The flob was not movated' is true based on these statements.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the flob was not skizzled. Statement 2 is a conditional statement that tells us what would happen if the flob was skizzled. However, since we already know that the flob was not skizzled, statement 2 does not provide any information about whether the flob movated or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that 'The flob was not movated' based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
