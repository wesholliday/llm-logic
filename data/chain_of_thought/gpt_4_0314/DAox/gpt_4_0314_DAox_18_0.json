If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The shank was not nugged\" from these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive, we can rewrite statement 2 as:\n\n3. If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\n\nNow, let's compare statement 1 and statement 3:\n\n1. The shank was not plooked.\n3. If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\n\nWe can see that statement 1 matches the consequent of statement 3 (the part after \"then\"). However, this does not allow us to infer the antecedent of statement 3 (the part before \"then\"), which is \"The shank was not nugged.\"\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The shank was not nugged\" from the given statements. \n\nAnswer: no",
