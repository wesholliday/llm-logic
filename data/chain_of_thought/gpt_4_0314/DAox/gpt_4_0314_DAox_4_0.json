If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the fribble did not crink.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the fribble was snurgled) is true, then the result (the fribble crinked) must also be true. However, the first statement tells us that the condition is not true (the fribble was not snurgled).\n\nSince the condition is not true, the conditional statement does not give us any information about whether the fribble crinked or not. It is possible that the fribble crinked for some other reason, or it did not crink at all.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the fribble did not crink based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
