If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the wug was not garpled.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the wug was sproinged) is true, then the result (it was garpled) must also be true. However, the first statement tells us that the wug was not sproinged. Since the condition is false, the conditional statement does not give us any information about whether the wug was garpled or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the wug was not garpled based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
