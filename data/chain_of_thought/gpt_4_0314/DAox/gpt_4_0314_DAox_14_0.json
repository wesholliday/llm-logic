If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\n\nWe are asked to infer if 'The clug was not snugged' from these statements.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (the clug was fleeked) is true, then the result (the clug snugged) must also be true. However, the first statement tells us that the clug was not fleeked. Since the condition is false, the conditional statement does not provide any information about whether the clug snugged or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The clug was not snugged' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
