If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\n\nWe are asked to infer if 'The dreb was not spened' is true based on these statements.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the dreb was vroombed) is true, then the result (the dreb was spened) must also be true. However, the first statement tells us that the condition is false (the dreb was not vroombed).\n\nSince the condition is false, the conditional statement does not give us any information about whether the dreb was spened or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The dreb was not spened' based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
