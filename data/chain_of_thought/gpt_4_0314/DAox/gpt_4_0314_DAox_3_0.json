If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\n\nWe are asked to infer if 'The splat did not quank' from these statements.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (the splat was morphed) is true, then the result (the splat quanked) must also be true. However, we know from the first statement that the condition is false (the splat was not morphed).\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement does not give us any information about what happens when the condition is false. It is possible that the splat did not quank, but it is also possible that the splat quanked for some other reason unrelated to morphing.\n\nSince we cannot definitively determine whether the splat quanked or not based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The splat did not quank'.\n\nAnswer: no",
