If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that if the zinger was fraggled, it would also be smoogled. However, statement 1 tells us that the zinger was not fraggled. Since the zinger was not fraggled, we cannot say for certain whether the zinger was smoogled or not, as statement 2 only provides information about the zinger being smoogled if it was fraggled.\n\nAnswer: no",
