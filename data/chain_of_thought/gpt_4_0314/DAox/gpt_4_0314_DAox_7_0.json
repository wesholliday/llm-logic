If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\n\nWe are asked to infer if 'The whiffle did not tink' is true.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (the whiffle was shanked) is true, then the result (the whiffle tinked) must also be true. However, the first statement tells us that the whiffle was not shanked. Since the condition is false, the conditional statement does not provide any information about whether the whiffle tinked or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The whiffle did not tink' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
