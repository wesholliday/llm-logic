If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\n\nWe are asked to infer if 'The flugel was not zargled' from these statements.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (the flugel was blimmed) is true, then the result (the flugel was zargled) must also be true. However, the first statement tells us that the condition (the flugel was blimmed) is false. \n\nIn this case, we cannot make any definitive conclusion about whether the flugel was zargled or not, because the conditional statement only tells us what happens if the flugel was blimmed, but it doesn't tell us anything about what happens if the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: no",
