If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\n\nWe are asked to infer if 'The glip was not tragged' is true based on these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule in logic, we can rewrite statement 2 as:\n\n3. If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged.\n\nNow, let's compare statements 1 and 3:\n\n1. The glip was not slogged.\n3. If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged.\n\nSince the glip was not slogged (statement 1), and statement 3 tells us that if the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged, we can infer that the glip was not tragged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
