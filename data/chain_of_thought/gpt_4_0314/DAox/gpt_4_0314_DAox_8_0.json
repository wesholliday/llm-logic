If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n\nWe are asked to infer whether \"The sprocket was not daggled\" is true based on these statements.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A (the sprocket was cranked), then B (the sprocket was daggled). However, we know from the first statement that A is false (the sprocket was not cranked).\n\nIn this case, we cannot directly infer the truth value of B (the sprocket was daggled) based on the given statements. The conditional statement only tells us what would happen if the sprocket was cranked, but it doesn't provide any information about what happens when the sprocket is not cranked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The sprocket was not daggled\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
