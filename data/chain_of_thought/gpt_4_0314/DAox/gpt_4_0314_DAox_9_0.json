If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\n\nWe are asked to infer if 'The twonk was not varnished' is true based on these statements.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the twonk was plinked) is true, then the result (it was varnished) must also be true. However, the first statement tells us that the condition (the twonk was plinked) is false. \n\nIn this case, the conditional statement does not provide any information about what happens when the condition is false. It is possible that the twonk was not varnished, but it is also possible that it was varnished for some other reason unrelated to being plinked.\n\nSince we do not have enough information to definitively conclude that the twonk was not varnished, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no",
