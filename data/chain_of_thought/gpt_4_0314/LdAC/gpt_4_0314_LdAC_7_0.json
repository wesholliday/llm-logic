Chris finished the race.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure of the statements:\n\n1. If A (Alex finished the race), then C (Chris finished the race).\n2. C (Chris finished the race).\n\nWe are asked if we can deduce A (Alex finished the race) from these statements. The given information tells us that if A is true, then C is true. However, it does not tell us that if C is true, then A must be true. In other words, we cannot logically deduce that Alex finished the race just because Chris finished the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
