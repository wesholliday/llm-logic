The truck was metal.\n\nWe are asked to deduce if the doll was plastic.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the doll being plastic) is true, then the second part (the truck being metal) must also be true. However, this statement does not guarantee that the doll being plastic is the only condition for the truck being metal.\n\nThe second statement confirms that the truck was indeed metal. But this information alone does not provide enough evidence to conclude that the doll was plastic. There could be other reasons for the truck being metal that are not mentioned.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce that the doll was plastic based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
