The mummy was awake.\n\nWe are asked to deduce if the vampire was awake.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A (vampire was awake), then B (mummy was awake). This means that if the vampire was awake, it is guaranteed that the mummy was awake. However, it does not guarantee that if the mummy was awake, the vampire must also be awake.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the mummy was awake (B is true). But we cannot conclude from this information alone that the vampire was awake (A is true) because the conditional statement does not work in reverse.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce that the vampire was awake based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
