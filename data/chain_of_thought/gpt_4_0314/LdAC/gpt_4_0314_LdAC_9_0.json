Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nWe are asked to deduce if Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means if the first part (antecedent) is true, then the second part (consequent) must also be true. However, this statement does not guarantee that if the second part is true, then the first part must also be true.\n\nIn this case, we know that Mark bought the blue shirt (statement 2), which is the consequent of the conditional statement. But we cannot logically deduce that Lisa bought the red shirt (the antecedent) based on this information alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
