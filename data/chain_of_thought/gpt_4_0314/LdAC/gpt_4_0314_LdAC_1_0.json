If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If M, then S (where M represents Mary being at the wedding and S represents Sue being at the wedding).\n\n2. Sue was at the wedding.\nThis statement can be represented as: S.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can logically deduce that Mary was at the wedding (M) from these two statements.\n\nThe first statement (If M, then S) tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also there. However, it does not tell us what happens if Sue is at the wedding without any information about Mary.\n\nThe second statement (S) tells us that Sue was at the wedding, but it does not provide any information about Mary's presence.\n\nSince we do not have enough information to determine whether Mary was at the wedding or not, we cannot logically deduce that Mary was at the wedding from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
