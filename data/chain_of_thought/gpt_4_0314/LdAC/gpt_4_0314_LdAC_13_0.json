The truck was blue.\n\nWe are asked to deduce if the car was red.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the car being red) is true, then the consequence (the truck being blue) must also be true. However, this statement does not guarantee that the car being red is the only way for the truck to be blue.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the truck was indeed blue. However, this information alone does not provide any direct information about the color of the car.\n\nSince we do not have enough information to guarantee that the car was red, we cannot logically deduce that the car was red based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
