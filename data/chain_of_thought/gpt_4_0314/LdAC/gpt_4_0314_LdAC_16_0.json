The pants were denim.\n\nWe are asked to deduce if the shirt was cotton.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A, then B. In this case, A represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and B represents \"the pants were denim.\"\n\nThe second statement confirms that B is true (the pants were denim).\n\nHowever, the given information does not provide a direct relationship between B and A. We only know that if A is true, then B is true. But we don't know if B being true necessarily means A is true. There could be other reasons for the pants being denim that are not related to the shirt being cotton.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce that the shirt was cotton based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
