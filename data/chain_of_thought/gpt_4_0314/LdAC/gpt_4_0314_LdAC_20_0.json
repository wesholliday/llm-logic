The banana was yellow.\n\nWe are asked to deduce if the apple was red.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the result (the banana being yellow) must also be true. However, this statement does not guarantee that the apple being red is the only way for the banana to be yellow.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the banana was indeed yellow. However, this information alone does not provide any direct information about the apple's color.\n\nSince we do not have enough information to guarantee that the apple was red, we cannot logically deduce that the apple was red based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
