If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\nThis statement can be represented as: If A, then B (where A is \"the book was written by James\" and B is \"the book is a mystery novel\").\n\n2. The book is a mystery novel.\nThis statement is simply B.\n\nNow, we are asked if we can logically deduce A (the book was written by James) from these statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement (If A, then B). It tells us that if A is true, then B must be true. However, it does not tell us anything about the case when B is true. In other words, knowing that B is true does not necessarily mean that A is true.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot logically deduce that the book was written by James.\n\nAnswer: no",
