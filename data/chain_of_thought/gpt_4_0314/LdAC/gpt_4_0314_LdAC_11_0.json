The muffins were blueberry.\n\nWe are asked to deduce if the cake was chocolate.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A (cake was chocolate), then B (muffins were blueberry). The second statement confirms that B (muffins were blueberry) is true.\n\nHowever, knowing that B is true does not necessarily mean that A (cake was chocolate) is true. The conditional statement only tells us that if A is true, then B must be true. It does not tell us that if B is true, then A must be true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce that the cake was chocolate based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
