Amy played tennis.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure of these statements. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the second part (Amy playing tennis) must also be true. However, this statement does not guarantee that if Amy played tennis, then Jeff must have played basketball.\n\nThe second statement simply tells us that Amy played tennis. It does not provide any information about whether Jeff played basketball or not.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot logically deduce that Jeff played basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
