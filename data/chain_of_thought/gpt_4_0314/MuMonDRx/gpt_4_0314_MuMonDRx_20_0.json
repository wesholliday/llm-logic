When we consider the second statement, \"The quank must be grazzle or zump,\" we are given two possibilities for the quank: it can be either grazzle or zump. Since we already know that the quank is zump from the first statement, it falls within the possibilities presented in the second statement. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
