In this case, the statement \"The quazzle must be gribble\" is explicit. If we consider the second statement \"The quazzle must be on grazzle or gribble,\" it presents two options for the quazzle: grazzle or gribble. Since we already know from the first statement that the quazzle must be gribble, it falls within the options presented in the second statement. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
