In this case, we are given the statement \"The zibber must be fizzle zibber.\" We are asked if we can infer \"The zibber must be bimboozle or fizzle zibber\" from the given statement. Since the given statement already establishes that the zibber must be fizzle zibber, adding the possibility of bimboozle does not contradict the original statement. The inference simply expands the possibilities for the zibber, while still including the original statement's information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
