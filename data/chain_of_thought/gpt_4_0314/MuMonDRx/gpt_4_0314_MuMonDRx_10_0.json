When we consider the statement \"The grazzle must be frazzle or wumble,\" we are essentially saying that the grazzle must have either the property of being frazzle or the property of being wumble. Since we already know that the grazzle is wumble, it satisfies the condition of being either frazzle or wumble.\n\nAnswer: yes",
