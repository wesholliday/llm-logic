The second statement presents two options: \"The plonk must be quimble flonk or flimble zibber.\" Since we know from the original statement that the plonk is indeed flimble zibber, it satisfies one of the conditions in the second statement. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
