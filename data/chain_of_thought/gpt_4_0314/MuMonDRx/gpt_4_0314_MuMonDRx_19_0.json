In this case, the statement \"The grooble must be blimp zibble\" is given. We are asked to infer if \"The grooble must be in grazzle or blimp zibble\" can be concluded from the given statement. Since the given statement already states that \"The grooble must be blimp zibble,\" it is reasonable to conclude that \"The grooble must be in grazzle or blimp zibble\" because it includes the possibility of \"blimp zibble\" which is already given in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
