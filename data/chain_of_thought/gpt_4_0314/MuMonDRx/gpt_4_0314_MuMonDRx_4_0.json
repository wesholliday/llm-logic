The second statement says that \"The grazzle must be quimble or blimple at zibber fizzle.\" This means that the grazzle must either be quimble or blimple at zibber fizzle. Since the original statement already establishes that the grazzle must blimple at zibber fizzle, it is also true that the grazzle must be quimble or blimple at zibber fizzle, as the condition of blimpling at zibber fizzle is already satisfied.\n\nAnswer: yes",
