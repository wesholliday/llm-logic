In this case, we are given the statement \"The flim must be wumble a plonk\" and asked if we can infer \"The flim must be crunk or wumble a plonk\" from it. Since the original statement already includes \"wumble a plonk,\" adding \"crunk\" as an alternative option does not contradict or change the meaning of the original statement. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
