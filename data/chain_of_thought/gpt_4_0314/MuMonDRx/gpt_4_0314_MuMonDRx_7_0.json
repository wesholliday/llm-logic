When we consider the second statement, \"The wibble must be wobble or zizz,\" we are given two options for what the wibble could be: wobble or zizz. Since the original statement tells us that the wibble must be zizz, it is still true that the wibble could be zizz in the second statement. Therefore, we can infer that the second statement is true based on the information provided in the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
