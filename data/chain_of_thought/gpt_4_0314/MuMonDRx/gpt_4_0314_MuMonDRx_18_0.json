In this case, we are given the statement \"The fizzle must be zazzle with gronk.\" We are asked if we can infer \"The fizzle must be on a quank gribble or zazzle with gronk\" from the given statement.\n\nThe given statement tells us that the fizzle is zazzle with gronk. The statement we are asked to infer includes an \"or\" which means that if either part of the statement is true, then the entire statement is true. Since we know that the fizzle is zazzle with gronk, the second part of the statement we are asked to infer is true. Therefore, we can infer the entire statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
