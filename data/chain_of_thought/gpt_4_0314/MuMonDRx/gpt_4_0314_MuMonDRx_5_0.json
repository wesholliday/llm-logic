Since the given statement asserts that the snorkel must be glorp zizz, it is already established that the snorkel is glorp zizz. The new statement presents two options: quorple or glorp zizz. Since we know that the snorkel is glorp zizz, it satisfies one of the options in the new statement, making the new statement true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
