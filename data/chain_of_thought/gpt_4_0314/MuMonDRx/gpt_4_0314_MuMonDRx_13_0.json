The new statement says that \"The quimble must be zibble or in glorp.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that either the quimble is zibble or it is in glorp. Since the original statement already establishes that the quimble must be in glorp, the new statement is true because it includes the original condition as one of the possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes",
