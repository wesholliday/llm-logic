            "content": "Let's break down the two statements:\n\n1. \"The notebook might not be in the drawer\" - This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the notebook is not in the drawer. It does not confirm or deny the presence of the notebook in the drawer.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer\" - This statement negates the idea that the notebook has to be in the drawer. It implies that there is no necessity for the notebook to be in the drawer, which means there is a possibility that it is not in the drawer.\n\nComparing the two statements, we can see that both suggest the possibility of the notebook not being in the drawer. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
