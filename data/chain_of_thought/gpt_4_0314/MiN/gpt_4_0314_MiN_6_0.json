In other words, it's not certain that she chose pizza.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" means that it's not necessary or certain that Sue chose pizza. In other words, there is room for doubt or other possibilities.\n\nComparing the two statements, we can see that they both express the idea that it's not certain that Sue chose pizza. Therefore, if we know that \"Sue might not have chosen pizza,\" we can infer that \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
