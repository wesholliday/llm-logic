It does not confirm whether the shoes are in the closet or not, but it suggests that they could be somewhere else.\n\nInference: \"It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet.\"\nThis statement is negating the idea that the shoes have to be in the closet. In other words, it's saying that the shoes are not necessarily in the closet.\n\nNow, let's compare the two statements. The given statement suggests that there is a possibility that the shoes are not in the closet, while the inference is negating the idea that the shoes have to be in the closet. Both statements are essentially saying that the shoes are not guaranteed to be in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
