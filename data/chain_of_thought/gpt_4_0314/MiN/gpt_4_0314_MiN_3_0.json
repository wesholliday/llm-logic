It does not confirm or deny whether James wrote the book, but it leaves open the possibility that someone else could have written it.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James\" - This statement also implies that there is no certainty that James wrote the book. It does not confirm or deny whether James wrote the book, but it negates the idea that James must be the author.\n\nBoth statements convey the idea that there is no certainty that James wrote the book, and they leave open the possibility that someone else could have written it. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
