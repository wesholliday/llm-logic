It does not confirm or deny the presence of the sunglasses in her bag.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag\" - This statement negates the idea that the sunglasses have to be in her bag. It implies that there is no certainty about the location of the sunglasses.\n\nBoth statements express uncertainty about the location of the sunglasses and do not confirm their presence in her bag. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
