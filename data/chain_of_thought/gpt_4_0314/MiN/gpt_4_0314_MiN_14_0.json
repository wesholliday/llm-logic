            "content": "Let's break down the given statement and the inference we want to make:\n\nGiven statement: \"The milk might not be on the counter.\"\nThis statement implies that there is a possibility that the milk is not on the counter. It does not confirm whether the milk is on the counter or not, but it allows for the possibility that it isn't.\n\nInference: \"It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter.\"\nThis statement is saying that it is not necessary for the milk to be on the counter. In other words, there is no requirement or certainty that the milk is on the counter.\n\nNow, let's compare the two statements. The given statement allows for the possibility that the milk is not on the counter, while the inference states that it is not necessary for the milk to be on the counter. Both statements agree that there is no certainty about the milk being on the counter. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
