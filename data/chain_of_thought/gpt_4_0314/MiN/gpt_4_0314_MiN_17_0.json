It does not confirm or deny the presence of the scarf in the backpack.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the scarf must be stuffed in my backpack\" - This statement also implies that there is no certainty that the scarf is in the backpack. It negates the idea that the scarf has to be in the backpack.\n\nSince both statements convey the idea that there is no certainty about the scarf being in the backpack, we can infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
