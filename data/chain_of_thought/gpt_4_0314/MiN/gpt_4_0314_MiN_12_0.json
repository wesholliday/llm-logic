It does not confirm whether the jacket is or is not draped over the chair.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the statement to be inferred - \"It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair.\" This statement implies that there is no necessity for the jacket to be draped over the chair. It does not confirm the actual location of the jacket.\n\nStep 3: Compare the two statements. Both statements convey that there is no certainty about the jacket being draped over the chair. The first statement presents a possibility that the jacket might not be draped over the chair, while the second statement negates the necessity of the jacket being draped over the chair.\n\nStep 4: Determine if the inference is valid. Since both statements convey uncertainty about the jacket's location and do not contradict each other, we can infer the second statement from the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
