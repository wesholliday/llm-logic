It does not confirm whether she bought it or not, but it leaves room for doubt.\n\nStatement to infer: \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\"\nThis statement is negating the idea that Lisa definitely bought the red shirt. In other words, it's saying that we cannot be certain that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nNow, let's compare the two statements. The given statement suggests that there is a possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, while the statement we want to infer is saying that we cannot be certain that Lisa bought the red shirt. Both statements express doubt about Lisa buying the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
