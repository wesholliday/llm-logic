            "content": "Let's break down the two statements:\n\n1. \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" - This statement suggests that there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding. It does not confirm her presence or absence.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" - This statement negates the idea that Mary's presence at the wedding is a necessity. It implies that there is no obligation or certainty that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's see if we can infer the second statement from the first one:\n\nIf there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding (as stated in the first statement), then it means that her presence at the wedding is not a certainty or a necessity. This aligns with the second statement, which negates the idea that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
