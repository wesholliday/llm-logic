            "content": "Let's break down the two statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. \"The toy might not be in the toy box\" - This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the toy is not in the toy box. It does not confirm or deny the toy's presence in the toy box, but it leaves room for doubt.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\" - This statement negates the idea that the toy has to be in the toy box. It implies that there is no necessity for the toy to be in the toy box, which also leaves room for doubt about the toy's presence in the toy box.\n\nBoth statements express uncertainty about the toy's presence in the toy box. Since the first statement allows for the possibility that the toy is not in the toy box, it aligns with the second statement, which negates the necessity of the toy being in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
