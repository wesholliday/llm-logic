It does not confirm whether Alex finished the race or not, but it leaves room for doubt.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race\" - This statement also implies that there is a possibility that Alex did not finish the race. It negates the idea that Alex's finishing the race is a certainty.\n\nSince both statements imply that there is a possibility that Alex did not finish the race, we can infer that if \"Alex might not have finished the race,\" then \"It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
