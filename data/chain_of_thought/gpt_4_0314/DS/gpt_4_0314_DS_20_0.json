The sunglasses aren't perched on her head.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n- We know that there are only two possibilities for the location of the sunglasses: in her bag or on her head.\n- We are given that the sunglasses are not on her head.\n\nSince there are only two possibilities and one of them is ruled out (not on her head), we can infer that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
