The pen isn't on my desk.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n- The first statement presents two possibilities: the pen is either in the bag or on the desk.\n- The second statement eliminates one of those possibilities: the pen is not on the desk.\n\nSince the first statement presents an \"either-or\" scenario, and the second statement eliminates one of those options, we can infer that the pen must be in the other location.\n\nAnswer: yes",
