It must be in one of these two places.\n\n2. \"The book isn't resting on the table\" - This statement eliminates one of the possibilities mentioned in the first statement.\n\nNow, since we know that the book is not on the table, and the only other option given is that it's on the shelf, we can infer that the book must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
