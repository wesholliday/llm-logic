The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor.\n\nThe first statement presents two possibilities: the puzzle piece is in the box, or it is blending in on the floor. The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities: the puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor. \n\nSince the first statement tells us that it must be one of the two options, and the second statement eliminates one of those options, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
