The toy isn't sitting on the shelf.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\nSince we know that either the toy is in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf, there are only two possibilities for the location of the toy. If one of these possibilities is proven to be false, then the other possibility must be true.\n\nIn this case, we are given that the toy isn't sitting on the shelf. This means that the second possibility (the toy is sitting on the shelf) is false.\n\nSince the second possibility is false, the only remaining possibility is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
