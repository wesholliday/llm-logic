However, the statement 'The flimble might zooble the crunk and the flimble might zooble the zizz' implies that there is a possibility that the flimble zoobles both the crunk and the zizz. Since the original statement does not exclude the possibility of the flimble zoobling both the crunk and the zizz, we can infer the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
