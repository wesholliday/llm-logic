These actions are presented as alternatives, meaning that one or the other might happen, but not necessarily both. However, the question asks if we can infer that both actions might happen, which means that the blimp might bimboozle the snork and the blimp might zizz the snork. Since the original statement presents these actions as alternatives, we can infer that it is possible for either action to occur, even though they may not both happen simultaneously.\n\nAnswer: yes",
