The proposed inference suggests that the zooble might flimble a wumble and the zooble might flimble a quimble, which means that there is a possibility of the zooble flimbling both a wumble and a quimble. The original statement does not provide enough information to conclude that both possibilities are true.\n\nAnswer: no",
