It does not confirm or deny the griffin's presence in the forest, but it leaves room for doubt.\n\nConclusion: It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest.\nThis statement asserts that it is not necessary for the griffin to have been in the forest. In other words, there is no requirement or certainty that the griffin was in the forest.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical connection between the premise and the conclusion. If there is a possibility that the griffin was not in the forest, then it follows that it is not necessary for the griffin to have been in the forest. The conclusion is a direct consequence of the premise, and there is no logical contradiction between them.\n\nAnswer: yes",
