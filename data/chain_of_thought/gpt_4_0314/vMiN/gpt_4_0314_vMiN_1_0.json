The conclusion states that it is not necessary that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nIn other words, the argument is saying that since there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding, it is not certain that she was there. This form of argument is logically valid because if there is any doubt or possibility that Mary was not at the wedding, then it cannot be said with certainty that she must have been there.\n\nAnswer: yes",
