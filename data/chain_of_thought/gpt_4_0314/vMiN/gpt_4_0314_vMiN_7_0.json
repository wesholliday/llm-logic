In other words, it is not certain that Alex finished the race.\n\nConclusion: It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race.\nThis statement is saying that it is not necessary or certain that Alex finished the race.\n\nNow, let's compare the premise and the conclusion. The premise states that there is a possibility that Alex did not finish the race, while the conclusion states that it is not certain that Alex finished the race. Both statements convey the same idea: that there is uncertainty about whether Alex finished the race or not.\n\nSince the conclusion follows directly from the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
