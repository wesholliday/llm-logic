It does not confirm or deny whether the alien visited Mars or not, but it leaves room for doubt.\n\nConclusion: It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars.\nThis statement asserts that it is not necessary or certain that the alien visited Mars. It also does not confirm or deny whether the alien visited Mars or not, but it denies the necessity of the alien's visit to Mars.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical connection between the premise and the conclusion:\n\nIf there is a possibility that the alien did not visit Mars (as stated in the premise), then it cannot be the case that the alien must have visited Mars (as stated in the conclusion). The premise allows for doubt, and the conclusion denies certainty. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
