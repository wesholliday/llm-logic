It does not confirm or deny the presence of the pen in the bag.\n\nConclusion: It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag.\nThis statement asserts that it is not necessary for the pen to be in the bag. It also does not confirm or deny the presence of the pen in the bag.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows from the premise. If there is a possibility that the pen is not in the bag, then it is not necessary for the pen to be in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
