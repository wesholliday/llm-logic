The conclusion states that it is not necessary that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nIn other words, the conclusion is denying the necessity of Lisa buying the red shirt, which is consistent with the premise that there is a possibility that she did not buy it. If there is a possibility that she did not buy it, then it cannot be necessary that she bought it.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
