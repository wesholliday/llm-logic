It does not confirm or deny the actual location of the milk.\n\nConclusion: It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter.\nThis statement implies that there is no necessity for the milk to be on the counter. In other words, it is not required for the milk to be on the counter.\n\nNow, let's examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. If there is a possibility that the milk is not on the counter, then it is true that it is not necessary for the milk to be on the counter. The conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
