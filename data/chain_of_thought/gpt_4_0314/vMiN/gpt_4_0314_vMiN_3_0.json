In other words, it is not certain that James wrote the book.\n\nConclusion: It's not the case that the book must have been written by James.\nThis statement also implies that it is not certain that James wrote the book. It denies the necessity of James being the author.\n\nNow, let's compare the premise and the conclusion. Both statements convey the same idea: that it is not certain that James wrote the book. The conclusion follows directly from the premise, so the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
