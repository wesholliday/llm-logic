It doesn't tell us whether she actually chose pizza or not, just that it's possible she didn't.\n\nConclusion: It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\nThis statement is saying that it is not necessary that Sue chose pizza. In other words, there is no requirement or certainty that Sue chose pizza.\n\nNow, let's compare the premise and the conclusion. The premise tells us that there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza, while the conclusion tells us that it is not necessary that Sue chose pizza. Both statements are essentially expressing the same idea: there is no certainty that Sue chose pizza.\n\nSince the conclusion follows directly from the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
