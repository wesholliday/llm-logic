It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can write it as an implication: Tom watched football \u2192 Jen watched basketball.\n\nStatement 2 negates the consequent of the implication, meaning Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that Tom did not watch football. In other words, we want to find if the contrapositive of the implication is true. The contrapositive is: Jen did not watch basketball \u2192 Tom did not watch football.\n\nSince we know that Jen did not watch basketball (from statement 2), we can infer that Tom did not watch football, based on the contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: yes",
