(Not Q)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta (Not P).\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 1 as:\n\n1. If Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta. (If not Q, then not P)\n\nSince statement 2 says that Kate did not eat salad (Not Q), we can now apply the contrapositive rule:\n\nIf not Q, then not P.\n\nSo, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta (Not P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
