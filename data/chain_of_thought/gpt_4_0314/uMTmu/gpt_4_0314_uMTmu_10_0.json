(Not C)\n\nNow, let's analyze the logic:\n\nWe know that if the dog was inside, the cat must have been outside. However, we also know that the cat was not outside. Since the cat being outside is a necessary condition for the dog being inside, and we know that this condition is not met, we can infer that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
