It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Alex finished the race, Chris would have definitely finished the race. However, statement 2 tells us that Chris finishing the race is not a certainty.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities:\n\n- If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race (according to statement 1). But this contradicts statement 2, which says that Chris finishing the race is not a certainty.\n\n- If Alex did not finish the race, then we don't have any information about Chris's performance. This scenario does not contradict either statement.\n\nSince the first scenario contradicts the given information, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
