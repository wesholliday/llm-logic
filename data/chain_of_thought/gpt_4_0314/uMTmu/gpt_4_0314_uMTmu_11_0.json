It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A (cake was chocolate), then B (muffins were blueberry).\n\nStatement 2 negates the conclusion of statement 1, which means that B (muffins were blueberry) is not necessarily true.\n\nIn order to infer whether the cake was not chocolate, we need to determine if the negation of B (muffins were blueberry) implies the negation of A (cake was chocolate).\n\nIf we negate both A and B, we get:\n\nIf not B (muffins were not blueberry), then not A (cake was not chocolate).\n\nHowever, statement 2 only tells us that it's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry, which means that the muffins could still be blueberry or not. This does not provide enough information to infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no",
