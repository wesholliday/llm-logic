It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. (Not B)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt (Not A).\n\nWe have a situation where \"If A, then B\" and \"Not B.\" According to the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens, if \"If A, then B\" is true and \"Not B\" is true, then we can infer \"Not A.\"\n\nSo, in this case, since both conditions are met, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
