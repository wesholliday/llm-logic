If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\nThis statement can be represented as: If B (bear in the cave), then W (wolf in the den).\n\n2. It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den.\nThis statement can be represented as: Not W (wolf not in the den).\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that the bear was not in the cave (Not B).\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if B is true, then W must be true. However, statement 2 tells us that W is not true. Since W is not true, we can infer that B must also not be true, because if B were true, then W would have to be true as well.\n\nSo, we can infer that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes",
