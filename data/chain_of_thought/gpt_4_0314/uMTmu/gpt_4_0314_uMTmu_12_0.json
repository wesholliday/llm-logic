It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo. (Not L)\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements using logical reasoning:\n\nIf we know that \"If J, then L\" is true and \"Not L\" is also true, we can use the contrapositive rule to infer the opposite. The contrapositive of \"If J, then L\" is \"If not L, then not J.\"\n\nSince we know that \"Not L\" is true, we can infer that \"Not J\" must also be true, which means Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
