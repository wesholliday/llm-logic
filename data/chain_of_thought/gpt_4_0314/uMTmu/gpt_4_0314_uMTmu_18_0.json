(Not necessarily Q)\n\nWe want to know if we can infer that the doll was not plastic (Not P).\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 1 as:\n\n1. If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic. (If not Q, then not P)\n\nNow, let's compare this with statement 2:\n\n1. If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic. (If not Q, then not P)\n2. It's not the case that the truck must have been metal. (Not necessarily Q)\n\nStatement 2 does not provide enough information to determine whether the truck was metal or not. It only tells us that it's not necessary for the truck to be metal. Therefore, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
