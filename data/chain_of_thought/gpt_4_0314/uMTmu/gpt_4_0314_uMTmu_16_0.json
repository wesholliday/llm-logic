It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a conditional statement: If A (shirt is cotton), then B (pants are denim).\n\nStatement 2 negates the necessity of B (pants being denim).\n\nWe want to know if we can infer that A (shirt is not cotton) based on these statements.\n\nIf statement 1 is true, and A (shirt is cotton) is true, then B (pants are denim) must also be true. However, statement 2 tells us that it's not the case that the pants must have been denim. This means that A (shirt is cotton) cannot be true, because if it were, it would contradict statement 2.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
