If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\nThis can be represented as: If J, then M (where J = written by James, M = mystery novel)\n\n2. It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\nThis can be represented as: Not M\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that the book was not written by James (Not J).\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite the first statement as: If not M, then not J.\n\nSince we know that it's not a mystery novel (Not M), we can now infer that the book was not written by James (Not J).\n\nAnswer: yes",
