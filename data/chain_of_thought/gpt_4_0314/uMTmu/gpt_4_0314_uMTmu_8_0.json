If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\nThis statement can be represented as: V -> M (where V represents the vampire being awake and M represents the mummy being awake)\n\n2. It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\nThis statement can be represented as: ~M (where ~M represents the mummy not being awake)\n\nNow, we want to infer whether the vampire was not awake, which can be represented as ~V.\n\nFrom statement 1 (V -> M), we know that if the vampire was awake, the mummy must have been awake. However, statement 2 (~M) tells us that the mummy was not awake. Since the mummy was not awake, the condition for the vampire being awake (V -> M) cannot be true. Therefore, we can infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
