It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\n\nWe can represent these statements using logical notation:\n\n1. G \u2192 U (If G is true, then U is true)\n2. \u00acU (U is not true)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \u00acG (G is not true) from these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 1 as:\n\n1. \u00acU \u2192 \u00acG (If \u00acU is true, then \u00acG is true)\n\nSince statement 2 is \u00acU, we can substitute it into the contrapositive of statement 1:\n\n\u00acU \u2192 \u00acG\n\nSo, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
