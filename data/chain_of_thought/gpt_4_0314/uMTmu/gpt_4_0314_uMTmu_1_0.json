It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. (Not S)\n\nNow, let's think step by step:\n\nIf we assume that Mary was at the wedding, then according to the first statement, Sue must have been at the wedding as well. However, the second statement tells us that Sue was not at the wedding. This creates a contradiction.\n\nSince assuming Mary was at the wedding leads to a contradiction, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
