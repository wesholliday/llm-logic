It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter. (Not B)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars (Not A).\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 1 as:\n\n1. If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars. (If not B, then not A)\n\nSince statement 2 says \"Not B,\" we can use statement 1 to infer that the alien did not visit Mars (Not A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
