It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If P (Sam took a plane), then Q (Erin must have taken a train).\n\nStatement 2 negates the Q part of the conditional statement, meaning that Erin did not necessarily take a train.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that Sam did not take a plane (\u00acP).\n\nIn a conditional statement, if the consequent (Q) is false, we can infer that the antecedent (P) is also false. In this case, since Q is false (Erin did not necessarily take a train), we can infer that P is also false (Sam did not take a plane).\n\nAnswer: yes",
