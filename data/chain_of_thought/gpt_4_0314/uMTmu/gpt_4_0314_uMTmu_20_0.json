It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow. (Not B)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that the apple was not red (Not A).\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 1 as:\n\n3. If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red. (If not B, then not A)\n\nSince statement 2 says that the banana was not yellow (Not B), we can use statement 3 to infer that the apple was not red (Not A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
