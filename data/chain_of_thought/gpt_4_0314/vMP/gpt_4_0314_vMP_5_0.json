This is a conditional statement, represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\n2. Second premise: Jeff played basketball. This is an affirmation of P.\n\n3. Conclusion: Amy played tennis. This is an affirmation of Q.\n\nThe argument follows the form of Modus Ponens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus Ponens states that if P \u2192 Q is true and P is true, then Q must also be true. In this case, since both premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
