(Premise 2)\n\nNow, we need to determine if the conclusion, \"The muffins were blueberry,\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nThis argument is in the form of a modus ponens, which is a valid argument form. Modus ponens has the structure:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. P.\n3. Therefore, Q.\n\nIn this case, P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins were blueberry.\" Since the argument follows the structure of modus ponens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
