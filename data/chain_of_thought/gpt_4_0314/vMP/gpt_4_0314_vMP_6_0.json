(Premise 2)\n\nNow, we need to determine if the conclusion \"Bob chose pasta\" logically follows from these premises.\n\nThe argument is in the form of a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and an affirmation of the antecedent (P). In this case, P is \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q is \"Bob chose pasta\". \n\nSince the first premise states that if P is true, then Q must also be true, and the second premise confirms that P is true, we can conclude that Q must be true as well.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Bob chose pasta\" logically follows from the premises, making this argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
