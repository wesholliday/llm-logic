            "content": "Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. First premise: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. Second premise: Lisa bought the red shirt. This is a statement that affirms P.\n\n3. Conclusion: Mark bought the blue shirt. This is a statement that affirms Q.\n\nThe argument follows the form of Modus Ponens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus Ponens states that if P \u2192 Q is true and P is true, then Q must also be true. In this case, since both premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
