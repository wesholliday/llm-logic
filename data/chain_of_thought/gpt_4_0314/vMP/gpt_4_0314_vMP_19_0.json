This is a conditional statement, represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\n2. Second premise: Tom watched football. This is a simple statement, represented as P.\n\n3. Conclusion: Jen watched basketball. This is another simple statement, represented as Q.\n\nThe argument is in the form of Modus Ponens, which is a valid argument form. Modus Ponens states that if P \u2192 Q is true and P is true, then Q must also be true. In this case, since both premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
