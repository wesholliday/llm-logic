            "content": "Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. First premise: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. Second premise: Mary was at the wedding. This statement affirms that P is true.\n\n3. Conclusion: Sue was at the wedding. This statement claims that Q is true.\n\nThe form of this argument is known as Modus Ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know that P is true, then we can conclude that Q is true. Since this argument follows the Modus Ponens form, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
