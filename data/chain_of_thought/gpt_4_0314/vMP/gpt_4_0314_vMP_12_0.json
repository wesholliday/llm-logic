(P)\n3. Conclusion: Lucy went to the zoo. (Q)\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Ponens, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. In Modus Ponens, if the first premise is true (If P, then Q) and the second premise is true (P), then the conclusion (Q) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
