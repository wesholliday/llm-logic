            "content": "Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. First premise: If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. This is a conditional statement, where the apple being red is the antecedent, and the banana being yellow is the consequent.\n\n2. Second premise: The apple was red. This statement affirms the antecedent of the conditional statement in the first premise.\n\n3. Conclusion: The banana was yellow. This statement is the consequent of the conditional statement in the first premise.\n\nThe form of this argument is known as modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument. In modus ponens, if the conditional statement (if P, then Q) is true and the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\nSince the argument follows the modus ponens form, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
