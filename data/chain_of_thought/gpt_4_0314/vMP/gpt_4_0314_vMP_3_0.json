(Premise 2)\n\nNow, we can apply the modus ponens rule, which states that if we have a conditional statement (like premise 1) and the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is true (like premise 2), then the consequent (the \"then\" part) must also be true.\n\nApplying modus ponens to this argument:\n\n3. The book is a mystery novel. (Conclusion)\n\nSince the conclusion follows logically from the premises using a valid rule of inference (modus ponens), the form of this argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
