            "content": "Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. First premise: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This is a conditional statement, where the vampire being awake is the antecedent (cause) and the mummy being awake is the consequent (effect).\n\n2. Second premise: The vampire was awake. This statement affirms the antecedent of the conditional statement in the first premise.\n\n3. Conclusion: The mummy was awake. This statement is the consequent of the conditional statement in the first premise.\n\nThe form of this argument is known as Modus Ponens, which is a valid form of argument in logic. In Modus Ponens, if the conditional statement (if P, then Q) is true and the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\nSo, based on the given premises and the form of the argument, we can conclude:\n\nAnswer: yes",
