            "content": "Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. First premise: If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim.\"\n\n2. Second premise: The shirt was cotton. This is a simple statement, which can be represented as P.\n\n3. Conclusion: The pants were denim. This is another simple statement, which can be represented as Q.\n\nNow, let's examine the logical structure of the argument. We have P \u2192 Q and P as premises, and we want to know if Q necessarily follows from these premises.\n\nIn this case, since we know that P \u2192 Q (if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim) and we also know that P (the shirt was cotton), we can conclude that Q (the pants were denim) must be true. This is an example of the modus ponens rule in logic, which states that if P \u2192 Q and P are both true, then Q must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
