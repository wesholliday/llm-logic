            "content": "Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. First premise: If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as A \u2192 C, where A is \"Alex finished the race\" and C is \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\n2. Second premise: Alex finished the race. This is a simple statement, represented as A.\n\n3. Conclusion: Chris finished the race. This is another simple statement, represented as C.\n\nNow, let's examine the logical structure of the argument. We have A \u2192 C and A as premises, and we want to determine if C necessarily follows from these premises.\n\nSince we know that A is true (from the second premise), we can substitute it into the conditional statement A \u2192 C. This gives us A \u2192 C and A. According to the rules of logic, specifically the modus ponens rule, if we have a conditional statement A \u2192 C and we know that A is true, then we can conclude that C is true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Chris finished the race\" necessarily follows from the given premises, making this form of argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
