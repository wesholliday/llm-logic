When we consider the statement \"The wump must be on the plimp or in the quank,\" we are presented with two possibilities: either the wump is on the plimp, or it is in the quank. Since we already know that the wump is on the plimp, the statement \"The wump must be on the plimp or in the quank\" is true because one of the two possibilities is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
