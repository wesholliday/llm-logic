In logic, the \"or\" operator is inclusive, meaning that if one of the statements is true, then the entire statement is true. Since the given statement is true, adding \"or be frazzle\" does not change the truth value of the statement. Therefore, we can infer the new statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
