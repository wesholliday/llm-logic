To infer means to deduce or conclude information from evidence and reasoning rather than from explicit statements. Since we know that the zibble must be glorp, it is also true that the zibble must be glorp or plonk, as the statement includes the fact that the zibble is glorp. The addition of \"or plonk\" does not negate the fact that the zibble is glorp, so the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
