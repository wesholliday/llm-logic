In logic, an \"or\" statement is considered true if at least one of the conditions is true. Since we already know that \"The wozzle must be floob\" is true, adding \"or glorp\" does not change the truth value of the statement. Therefore, we can infer the statement \"The wozzle must be floob or glorp\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
