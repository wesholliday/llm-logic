In logic, the \"or\" operator is inclusive, meaning that if one of the statements is true, then the entire statement is true. Since we know that \"The frazzle must be crunk zump\" is true, the statement \"The frazzle must be crunk zump or flibbit floob\" is also true, regardless of whether \"flibbit floob\" is true or not.\n\nAnswer: yes",
