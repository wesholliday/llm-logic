The first statement asserts that the frazzle must be froodle. The second statement presents two possibilities: the frazzle must be froodle, or the frazzle must be wobble. Since the first statement already establishes that the frazzle must be froodle, the second statement is true because one of its two possibilities is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
