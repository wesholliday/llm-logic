In logic, when we have a statement A, we can always infer A or B, where B can be any other statement. This is because the \"or\" operator in logic is inclusive, meaning that if either A or B is true, then the whole statement is true. Since we know that \"The plonk must be quork frozz\" is true, it doesn't matter whether \"fizzle\" is true or false; the whole statement \"The plonk must be quork frozz or fizzle\" will still be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
