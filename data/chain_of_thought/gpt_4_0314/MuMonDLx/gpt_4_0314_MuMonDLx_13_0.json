When we add \"or zizz zump wobble,\" we are introducing an additional possibility, which does not negate the original statement. Since the original statement is true, adding another possibility does not make it false. Therefore, we can infer that \"The quorple must be in quazzle or zizz zump wobble\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
