In logic, when we say \"A or B,\" it means that either A is true, B is true, or both A and B are true. Since we know that \"The grooble must be plonk wobble\" is true, it is valid to say that \"The grooble must be plonk wobble or flonk wozzle bimboozle\" because the first part of the statement is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
