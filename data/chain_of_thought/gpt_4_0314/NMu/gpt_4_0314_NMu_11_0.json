In other words, it is possible that the newspaper is not in the driveway.\n\nInference: \"The newspaper might not be in the driveway.\"\nThis statement suggests that there is a possibility that the newspaper is not in the driveway.\n\nComparing the two statements, we can see that the inference is consistent with the given statement. The given statement denies the necessity of the newspaper being in the driveway, and the inference acknowledges the possibility of the newspaper not being in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes",
