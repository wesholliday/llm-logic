In other words, it is possible that someone else wrote the book.\n\nStatement to infer: \"The book might not have been written by James.\"\nThis statement also implies that there is a possibility that James did not write the book.\n\nSince both statements convey the same idea that there is no certainty that James wrote the book, we can infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
