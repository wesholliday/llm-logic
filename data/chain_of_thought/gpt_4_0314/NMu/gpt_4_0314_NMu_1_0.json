In other words, it is not certain that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer: \"Mary might not have been at the wedding.\"\n\nThis statement suggests that there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nSince the original statement tells us that it is not certain that Mary was at the wedding, it leaves room for the possibility that she might not have been there. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
