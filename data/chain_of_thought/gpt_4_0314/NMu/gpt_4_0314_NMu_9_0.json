In other words, it is possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer: \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt.\" This statement suggests that there is a possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nComparing the two statements, we can see that both convey the same idea: there is a possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
