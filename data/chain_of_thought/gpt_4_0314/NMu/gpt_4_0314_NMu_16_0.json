In other words, it is possible that the pen is not in the bag.\n\nInference: \"The pen might not be in my bag.\"\nThis statement suggests that there is a possibility that the pen is not in the bag.\n\nComparing the two statements, we can see that both convey the same idea - that there is a possibility that the pen is not in the bag. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
