In other words, it is possible that the scarf is not in the backpack.\n\nNow, let's look at the statement we want to infer: \"The scarf might not be stuffed in my backpack.\"\n\nThis statement suggests that there is a possibility that the scarf is not in the backpack.\n\nSince the original statement implies that there is no necessity for the scarf to be in the backpack, and the inferred statement suggests that there is a possibility that the scarf is not in the backpack, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
