In other words, it is not certain that Jeff played basketball.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer: \"Jeff might not have played basketball.\"\n\nThis statement suggests that there is a possibility that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nSince the original statement tells us that it is not certain that Jeff played basketball, it leaves room for the possibility that he might not have played basketball. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
