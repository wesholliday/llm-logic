In other words, it is possible that the shoes are not in the closet.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer: \"The shoes might not be in the closet.\"\n\nThis statement suggests that there is a possibility that the shoes are not in the closet.\n\nComparing the two statements, we can see that both convey the idea that it is possible for the shoes not to be in the closet. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
