In other words, it is possible that the toy is not in the toy box.\n\nNow, let's look at the inference: \"The toy might not be in the toy box.\"\n\nThis statement also suggests that there is a possibility that the toy is not in the toy box.\n\nSince both the given statement and the inference convey the same idea that there is no certainty about the toy being in the toy box, we can infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
