In other words, it is not certain that the vampire was awake.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer: \"The vampire might not have been awake.\"\n\nThis statement suggests that there is a possibility that the vampire was not awake. It does not claim certainty, but rather acknowledges the uncertainty of the vampire's state of being awake or not.\n\nSince the given statement tells us that it is not certain that the vampire was awake, it leaves room for the possibility that the vampire might not have been awake. Therefore, we can infer the statement \"The vampire might not have been awake\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
