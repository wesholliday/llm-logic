In other words, it is not certain that Sue chose pizza.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer: \"Sue might not have chosen pizza.\"\n\nThis statement suggests that there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nSince the original statement tells us that it is not certain that Sue chose pizza, it leaves open the possibility that she might not have chosen pizza.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the statement \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
