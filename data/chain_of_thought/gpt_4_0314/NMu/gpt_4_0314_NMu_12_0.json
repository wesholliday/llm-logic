In other words, it is not required or mandatory for the jacket to be in that position.\n\nQuestion: \"Can we infer 'The jacket might not be draped over the chair'?\"\nThis question is asking if it's possible that the jacket is not draped over the chair, given the information from the original statement.\n\nSince the original statement tells us that there is no necessity for the jacket to be draped over the chair, it is reasonable to infer that it might not be draped over the chair. There is no requirement for it to be in that position, so it could be elsewhere.\n\nAnswer: yes",
