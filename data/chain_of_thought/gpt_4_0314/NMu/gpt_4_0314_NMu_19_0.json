In other words, it is possible that the watch is not charging on the dresser.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer: \"The watch might not be charging on the dresser.\"\n\nThis statement suggests that there is a possibility that the watch is not charging on the dresser.\n\nSince the given statement implies that there is no necessity for the watch to be charging on the dresser, and the statement we want to infer suggests that there is a possibility that the watch is not charging on the dresser, we can infer the latter statement from the former.\n\nAnswer: yes",
