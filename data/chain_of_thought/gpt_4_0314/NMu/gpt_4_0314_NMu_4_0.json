In other words, it is possible that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nStatement to infer: \"The alien might not have visited Mars.\"\nThis statement also suggests that it is possible that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nSince both statements convey the same idea that there is a possibility that the alien did not visit Mars, we can infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
