In other words, there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not in her bag.\n\nInference: \"The sunglasses might not be in her bag.\"\nThis statement also suggests that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not in her bag.\n\nSince both the given statement and the inference convey the same idea that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not in her bag, we can infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
