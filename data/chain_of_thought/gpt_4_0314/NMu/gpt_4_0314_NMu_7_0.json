In other words, it is possible that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nNow, let's look at the statement we want to infer:\n\n\"Alex might not have finished the race\" means that there is a possibility that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nComparing the two statements, we can see that they both convey the same idea: there is a possibility that Alex did not finish the race. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
