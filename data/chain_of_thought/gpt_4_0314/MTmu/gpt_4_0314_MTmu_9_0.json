It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\nThis can be represented as: Not B.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt' (Not A) from these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite the first statement as:\nIf not B, then not A.\n\nSince the second statement is 'Not B', we can now infer 'Not A' based on the contrapositive rule.\n\nAnswer: yes",
