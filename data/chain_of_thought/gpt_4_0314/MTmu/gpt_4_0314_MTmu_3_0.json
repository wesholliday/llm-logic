If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\nThis can be represented as: If A, then B (where A is \"the book was written by James\" and B is \"the book must be a mystery novel\").\n\n2. It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\nThis can be represented as: not B.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer not A (the book was not written by James) from these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite the first statement as: If not B, then not A. This means that if the book is not a mystery novel, then it was not written by James.\n\nSince we know that not B is true (the book is not a mystery novel), we can infer not A (the book was not written by James) based on the contrapositive of the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
