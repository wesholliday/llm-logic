It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\nThis can be represented as: Not A.\n\nNow, we want to infer if 'Jeff did not play basketball' (Not J) is true based on these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite the first statement as:\nIf not A, then not J.\n\nSince we know that 'Not A' is true (from statement 2), we can infer that 'Not J' (Jeff did not play basketball) is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
