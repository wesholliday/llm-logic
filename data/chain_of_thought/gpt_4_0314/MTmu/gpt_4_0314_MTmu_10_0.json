It's not the case that the cat must have been outside. (Not B)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The dog was not inside' (Not A) from these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 1 as:\n\n1. If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside. (If not B, then not A)\n\nComparing this with statement 2, we can see that both statements have the same condition (Not B). Therefore, we can infer the conclusion of statement 1:\n\nAnswer: yes",
