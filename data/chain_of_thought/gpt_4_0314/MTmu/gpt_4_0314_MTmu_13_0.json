(Not B)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The car was not red' (Not A) from these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 1 as:\n\n1. If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red. (If not B, then not A)\n\nSince statement 2 is 'Not B', we can now use modus ponens to infer 'Not A':\n\nIf not B, then not A (from the contrapositive of statement 1)\nNot B (from statement 2)\nTherefore, not A.\n\nSo, we can infer 'The car was not red' (Not A) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
