It's not the case that the truck must have been metal. (Not Q)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The doll was not plastic' (Not P) from these statements.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can apply the contrapositive rule to statement 1. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" So, the contrapositive of statement 1 is:\n\n3. If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic. (If not Q, then not P)\n\nNow, we can see that statement 2 (Not Q) and statement 3 (If not Q, then not P) allow us to infer 'The doll was not plastic' (Not P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
