It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\nThis can be represented as: Not U.\n\nNow, we want to infer if 'The griffin was not in the forest' is true, which can be represented as: Not G.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite the first statement as: If not U, then not G.\n\nSince we know that 'Not U' is true, we can infer 'Not G' based on the contrapositive of the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
