If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\nThis statement can be represented as: If B, then W (where B represents the bear being in the cave, and W represents the wolf being in the den).\n\n2. It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den.\nThis statement can be represented as: Not W.\n\nNow, we want to infer if 'The bear was not in the cave' is true based on these statements. In other words, we want to know if Not B is true.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite the first statement as: If Not W, then Not B. Since we know that Not W is true (from the second statement), we can infer that Not B is also true.\n\nSo, the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes",
