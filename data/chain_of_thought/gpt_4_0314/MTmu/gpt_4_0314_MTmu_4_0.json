If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\nWe can represent this as: A \u2192 R (where A represents the alien visiting Mars and R represents the robot visiting Jupiter)\n\n2. It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter.\nWe can represent this as: \u00acR (where \u00acR represents the robot not visiting Jupiter)\n\nNow, we want to infer if the alien did not visit Mars (\u00acA).\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite the first statement as:\n\u00acR \u2192 \u00acA\n\nSince we know \u00acR is true (from statement 2), we can infer \u00acA.\n\nAnswer: yes",
