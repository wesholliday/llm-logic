It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo. (Not Q)\n\nWe want to infer if Joe did not go to the park (Not P).\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can apply Modus Tollens:\n\nModus Tollens states that if we have (If P, then Q) and (Not Q), we can infer (Not P).\n\nSince we have (If P, then Q) and (Not Q), we can apply Modus Tollens and infer (Not P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
