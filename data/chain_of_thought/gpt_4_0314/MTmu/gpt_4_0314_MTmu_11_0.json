It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nUsing the contrapositive, we can rephrase statement 1 as:\n\n1a. If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\n\nNow, let's compare statement 1a with statement 2:\n\n1a. If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\n2. It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nStatement 2 implies that the muffins could be something other than blueberry. Since statement 1a says that if the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate, we can infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
