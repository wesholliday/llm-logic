It's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad.\n\nNow, let's think step by step:\n\nIf statement 1 is true, then whenever Ben ate pasta, Kate must have eaten the salad. Statement 2 tells us that it is not true that Kate must have eaten the salad. This means that there is a possibility that Kate did not eat the salad. \n\nIf Kate did not eat the salad, then, according to statement 1, Ben could not have eaten pasta. Therefore, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
