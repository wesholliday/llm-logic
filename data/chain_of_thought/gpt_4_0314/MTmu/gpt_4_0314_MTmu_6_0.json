It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. If Sue chose pizza (P), then Bob must have chosen pasta (Q). This can be represented as P \u2192 Q.\n2. It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta (\u00acQ).\n\nWe want to infer if Sue did not choose pizza (\u00acP).\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite the first statement as \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP. This means if Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nSince the second statement is \u00acQ, we can substitute it into the contrapositive:\n\n\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\nNow we have:\n\n\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\u00acQ\n\nApplying modus ponens, we can infer:\n\n\u00acP\n\nSo, we can conclude that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
