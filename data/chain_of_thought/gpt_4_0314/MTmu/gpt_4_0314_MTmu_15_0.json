It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If P (Sam took a plane), then Q (Erin must have taken a train).\n\nStatement 2 negates the consequent of Statement 1, which can be represented as: Not Q (Erin did not necessarily take a train).\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know that the consequent (Q) is false, we can infer that the antecedent (P) must also be false. This is known as the contrapositive.\n\nSo, in this case, since we know that Erin did not necessarily take a train (Not Q), we can infer that Sam did not take a plane (Not P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
