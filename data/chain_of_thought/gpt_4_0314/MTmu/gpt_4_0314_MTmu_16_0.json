It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\nStatement 1 is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A (shirt was cotton), then B (pants must have been denim).\n\nStatement 2 negates the conclusion of the conditional statement (B), meaning that the pants were not necessarily denim.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that the shirt was not cotton (\u00acA), we need to see if the negation of B (\u00acB) implies the negation of A (\u00acA).\n\nIn this case, if \u00acB is true (the pants were not necessarily denim), it does not necessarily mean that \u00acA is true (the shirt was not cotton). There could be other reasons for the pants not being denim, unrelated to the shirt being cotton.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the shirt was not cotton based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
