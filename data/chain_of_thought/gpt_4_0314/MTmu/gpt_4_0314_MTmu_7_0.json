It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race.\nThis can be represented as: Not necessarily C.\n\nNow, we want to infer if 'Alex did not finish the race' is true based on these statements.\n\nIf we assume that Alex finished the race (A is true), then according to statement 1, Chris must have finished the race (C is true). However, statement 2 tells us that it's not necessarily true that Chris finished the race. This means that our assumption that Alex finished the race (A is true) leads to a contradiction with statement 2.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
