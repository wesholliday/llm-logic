If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A (apple was red), then B (banana must have been yellow).\n\n2. It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\nThis statement negates the conclusion of the first statement, which can be represented as: not B (banana was not necessarily yellow).\n\nNow, we want to infer if the apple was not red (not A) from these two statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite the first statement as: If not B (banana was not necessarily yellow), then not A (apple was not red).\n\nSince the second statement is not B, and the contrapositive rule states that if not B, then not A, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
