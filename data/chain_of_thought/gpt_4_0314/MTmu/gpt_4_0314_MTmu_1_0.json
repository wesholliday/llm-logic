If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\nThis statement can be represented as: If M, then S (where M represents Mary being at the wedding and S represents Sue being at the wedding).\n\n2. It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\nThis statement can be represented as: not S (Sue was not necessarily at the wedding).\n\nNow, we want to infer if Mary was not at the wedding (not M) based on these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite the first statement as: If not S, then not M. Since the second statement is not S, we can infer that not M is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
