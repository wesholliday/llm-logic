If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\nThis can be represented as: V -> M (where V is the vampire being awake and M is the mummy being awake)\n\n2. It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\nThis can be represented as: ~M (where ~M is the negation of the mummy being awake)\n\nNow, we want to infer if the vampire was not awake, which can be represented as ~V.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 1 as:\n~M -> ~V (If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake)\n\nSince statement 2 is ~M, we can substitute it into the contrapositive of statement 1:\n~M -> ~V\n\nSo, given that ~M is true, we can infer that ~V is also true, which means the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
