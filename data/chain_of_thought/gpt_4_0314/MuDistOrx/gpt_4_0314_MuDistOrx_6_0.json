This means that there are two possible actions the blimp must take: gribbling a flonk or gribbling a wibble snorkel. The rephrased statement also presents these two options, stating that the blimp must either gribble a flonk or it must gribble a wibble snorkel. Both statements convey the same meaning, which is that the blimp has to perform one of the two actions.\n\nAnswer: yes",
