This means that there are two possibilities: either the zibber gronks a quank, or it gronks a zump crunk. The proposed inference is that the zibber must gronk a quank or it must gronk a zump crunk, which is essentially the same as the given statement, just rephrased. Both statements present the same two possibilities for the zibber.\n\nAnswer: yes",
