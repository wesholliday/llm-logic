This means that there are two possibilities: either the flim quazzles a frazzle, or it quazzles a glorp. The rephrased statement says the same thing: the flim must quazzle a frazzle, or it must quazzle a glorp. Both statements present the same two possibilities, so we can infer the rephrased statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
