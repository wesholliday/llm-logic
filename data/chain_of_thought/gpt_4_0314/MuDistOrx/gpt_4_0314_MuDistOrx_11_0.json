This means that there are two possibilities for the shimble: it is either snizzle plonk or it is zibber. The rephrased statement also presents these two possibilities, stating that the shimble must be snizzle plonk or it must be zibber. Both statements convey the same meaning, so we can infer the rephrased statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
