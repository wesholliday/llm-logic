This means that there are two possibilities for the snorkel to be flim: either by quank or by fribble. The rephrased statement also presents the same two possibilities: the snorkel must be flim by quank, or it must be flim by fribble. Both statements convey the same meaning, which is that the snorkel must be flim by one of the two options.\n\nAnswer: yes",
