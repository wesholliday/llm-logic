This means that there are two possibilities for the quibble: it is either floob on the froodle or snork on the zump. The rephrased statement also presents the same two possibilities for the quibble: it must be floob on the froodle or it must be snork on the zump. Both statements convey the same meaning, which is that the quibble has to be one of these two options.\n\nAnswer: yes",
