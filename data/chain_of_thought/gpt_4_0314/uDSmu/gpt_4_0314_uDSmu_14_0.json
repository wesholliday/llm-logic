It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\n\nFrom statement 1, we have two possibilities: milk on the counter (A) or milk in the fridge (B). This can be represented as A or B.\n\nStatement 2 negates the possibility of the milk being in the fridge, which means B is false.\n\nSince we have A or B, and B is false, the only remaining possibility is A, which means the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
