It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that there are two possibilities: the piece is in the box or it's blending in on the floor. The second statement tells us that it's not blending in on the floor. Since there are only two possibilities and one of them is ruled out, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
