It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\n\nFrom statement 2, we can infer that it is not necessary for the sock to be under the bed. Since statement 1 tells us that the sock is either in the laundry basket or under the bed, and we know it's not necessarily under the bed, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
