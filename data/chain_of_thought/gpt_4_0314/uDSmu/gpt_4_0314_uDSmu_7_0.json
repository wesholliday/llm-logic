It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are two possibilities for the umbrella's location: in the car or in the closet. Statement 2 tells us that the umbrella doesn't have to be in the closet. Since there are only two possible locations and the umbrella doesn't have to be in the closet, we can infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
