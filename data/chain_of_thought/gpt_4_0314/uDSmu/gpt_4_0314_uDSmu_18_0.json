It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are two possibilities: the notebook is in the drawer or it is on the nightstand. Statement 2 tells us that it is not necessary for the notebook to be on the nightstand. This means that the possibility of the notebook being on the nightstand is not certain.\n\nHowever, since we know that the notebook must be in one of these two locations, and the possibility of it being on the nightstand is not certain, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
