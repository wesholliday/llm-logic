It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\n\nFrom statement 1, we have two possibilities: the pen is in the bag or the pen is on the desk. Since statement 2 tells us that it's not the case that the pen must be on the desk, we can eliminate the possibility of the pen being on the desk.\n\nNow, we are left with only one possibility: the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
