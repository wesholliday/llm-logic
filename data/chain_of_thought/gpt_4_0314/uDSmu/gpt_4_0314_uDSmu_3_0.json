It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that there are two possibilities: keys in the drawer or keys dangling in the cabinet. The second statement tells us that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet. Since there are only two possibilities and one of them is ruled out, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
