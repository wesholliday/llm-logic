We can represent this as P \u2192 Q, where P represents \"Sam took a plane\" and Q represents \"Erin took a train.\"\n\nThe given conclusion is: If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane. We can represent this as Q \u2192 P.\n\nNow, we need to determine if the argument is logically valid. An argument is logically valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nIn this case, the premise P \u2192 Q does not guarantee that the conclusion Q \u2192 P is true. For example, it's possible that Sam took a plane and Erin took a train, but Erin taking a train doesn't necessarily mean that Sam took a plane. There could be other reasons for Erin taking a train.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
