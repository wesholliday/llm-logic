This can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nThe given conclusion is: If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football. This can be represented as Q \u2192 P.\n\nNow, we need to determine if the argument is logically valid. An argument is logically valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nIn this case, the premise states that if P is true, then Q is true. However, it does not guarantee that if Q is true, then P must also be true. For example, it is possible that Jen watched basketball for some other reason, and Tom did not watch football. In this case, the premise would still hold true, but the conclusion would be false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
