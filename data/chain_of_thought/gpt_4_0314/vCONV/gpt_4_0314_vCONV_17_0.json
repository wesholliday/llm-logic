An argument is logically valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nIn this case, the premise only tells us that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. However, it does not tell us anything about what happens if Kate ate salad. It is possible that Kate ate salad, but Ben did not eat pasta. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
