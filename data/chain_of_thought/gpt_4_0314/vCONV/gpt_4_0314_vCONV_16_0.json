An argument is logically valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nIn this case, the premise states that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton. It is possible that the pants were denim for some other reason, and the shirt was not cotton.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
