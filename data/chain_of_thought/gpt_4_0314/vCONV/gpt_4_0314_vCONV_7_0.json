An argument is logically valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nIn this case, the premise states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. However, this does not necessarily mean that if Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race. It is possible that Chris could finish the race without Alex finishing it.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise, and the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
