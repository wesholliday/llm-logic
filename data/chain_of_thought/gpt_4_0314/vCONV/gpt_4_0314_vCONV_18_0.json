However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the truck was metal. It is possible that the truck being metal has no relation to the doll being plastic, or that the doll could be made of another material.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that if the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic based solely on the given premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
