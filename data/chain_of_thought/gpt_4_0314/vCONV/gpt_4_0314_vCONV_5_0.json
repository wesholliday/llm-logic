This can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nThe given conclusion is: If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball. This can be represented as Q \u2192 P.\n\nNow, we need to determine if the argument is logically valid. An argument is logically valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nIn this case, the premise states that Jeff playing basketball implies Amy playing tennis. However, it does not necessarily mean that Amy playing tennis implies Jeff playing basketball. It is possible that Amy played tennis without Jeff playing basketball.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
