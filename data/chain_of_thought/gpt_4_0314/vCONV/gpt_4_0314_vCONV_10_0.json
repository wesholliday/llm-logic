We can represent this as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the dog was inside\" and Q is \"the cat was outside.\"\n\nThe given conclusion is: If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside. We can represent this as Q \u2192 P.\n\nNow, we need to determine if the argument is logically valid. An argument is logically valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nIn this case, the premise only tells us what happens when the dog is inside (the cat is outside). However, it doesn't tell us what happens when the cat is outside. It's possible that the dog could be inside or outside when the cat is outside. Therefore, we cannot conclude that if the cat is outside, then the dog must be inside.\n\nAnswer: no",
