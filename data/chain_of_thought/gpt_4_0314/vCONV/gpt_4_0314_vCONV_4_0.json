An argument is logically valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nIn this case, the premise states that if P is true, then Q is true. However, the conclusion states that if Q is true, then P is true. This is not necessarily true based on the premise alone. It is possible for the robot to visit Jupiter without the alien visiting Mars.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
