This can be represented as: If M, then S.\n\nThe conclusion is: If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding. This can be represented as: If S, then M.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical validity of this argument. An argument is logically valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nIn this case, the premise only tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also there. However, it does not provide any information about whether Mary would be at the wedding if Sue was there. It is possible that Sue could be at the wedding without Mary being there.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
