We can represent this as P \u2192 Q, where P represents \"the vampire was awake\" and Q represents \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\nThe conclusion is: If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake. We can represent this as Q \u2192 P.\n\nNow, we need to determine if the argument is logically valid. An argument is logically valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nIn this case, the premise only tells us that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. It does not provide any information about what happens if the mummy was awake. It is possible that the mummy could be awake without the vampire being awake. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
