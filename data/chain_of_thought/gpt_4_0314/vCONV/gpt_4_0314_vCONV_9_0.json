An argument is logically valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nIn this case, the premise states that if P is true, then Q is true. However, the conclusion states that if Q is true, then P is true. This is not necessarily the case, as the premise does not provide any information about what happens when Q is true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
