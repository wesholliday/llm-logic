This can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\nThe given conclusion is: If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red. This can be represented as Q \u2192 P.\n\nNow, we need to determine if this form of argument is logically valid. A logically valid argument is one where if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the premise being true (P \u2192 Q) does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion (Q \u2192 P). It is possible for the apple to be red and the banana to be yellow, but it is also possible for the banana to be yellow without the apple being red.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
