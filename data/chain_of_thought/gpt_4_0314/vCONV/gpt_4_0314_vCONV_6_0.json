We can represent this as P \u2192 Q, where P represents \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q represents \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\nThe given conclusion is: If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza. We can represent this as Q \u2192 P.\n\nNow, we need to determine if the argument is logically valid. An argument is logically valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nIn this case, the premise states that if P is true, then Q is true. However, it does not guarantee that if Q is true, then P must also be true. For example, it could be the case that Bob chose pasta for some other reason, and Sue did not choose pizza. In this situation, the premise would still hold true, but the conclusion would be false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
