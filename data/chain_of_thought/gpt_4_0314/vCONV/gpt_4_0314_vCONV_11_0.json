An argument is logically valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nIn this case, the premise P \u2192 Q does not guarantee that Q \u2192 P. It is possible for the muffins to be blueberry without the cake being chocolate. For example, the cake could be vanilla, and the muffins could still be blueberry.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise, and the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
