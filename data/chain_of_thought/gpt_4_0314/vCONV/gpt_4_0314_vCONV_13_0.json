This can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\"\n\nThe given conclusion is: If the truck was blue, then the car was red. This can be represented as Q \u2192 P.\n\nNow, we need to determine if this form of argument is logically valid. A logically valid argument is one where if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the premise being true (P \u2192 Q) does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion (Q \u2192 P). It is possible for the car to be red and the truck to be blue, but it is also possible for the truck to be blue and the car to be a different color.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
