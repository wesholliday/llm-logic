It does not confirm whether the grommet was sploffed or not, but it allows for the possibility that it wasn't.\n\nQuestion: \"It's not the case that the grommet must have been sploffed.\"\nThis statement is essentially saying that it is not necessary for the grommet to have been sploffed. In other words, there is no requirement or certainty that the grommet was sploffed.\n\nNow, let's compare the two statements. The given statement allows for the possibility that the grommet was not sploffed, while the question statement says that it is not necessary for the grommet to have been sploffed.
