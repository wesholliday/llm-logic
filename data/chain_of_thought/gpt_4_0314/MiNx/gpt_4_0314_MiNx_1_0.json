In other words, it is not certain that the flugel was blimmed.\n\nQuestion: \"Can we infer 'It's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed'?\"\nThis question is asking if we can conclude that it is not necessary for the flugel to have been blimmed.\n\nNow, let's compare the two statements. The given statement tells us that it is possible that the flugel was not blimmed, which means it is not certain that the flugel was blimmed. The question asks if we can conclude that it is not necessary for the flugel to have been blimmed. Since the given statement already implies that it is not certain that the flugel was blimmed, we can infer that it is not necessary for the flugel to have been blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
