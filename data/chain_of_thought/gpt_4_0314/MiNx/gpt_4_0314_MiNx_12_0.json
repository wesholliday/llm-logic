It does not confirm whether the smip was actually shripped or not, but it allows for the possibility that it wasn't.\n\nQuestion: \"Can we infer 'It's not the case that the smip must have been shripped'?\"\nThis question is asking if we can conclude that it is not necessary for the smip to have been shripped. In other words, it's asking if we can rule out the possibility that the smip absolutely had to be shripped.\n\nSince the given statement allows for the possibility that the smip was not shripped, it implies that it is not necessary for the smip to have been shripped. Therefore, we can infer the statement in the question.\n\nAnswer: yes",
