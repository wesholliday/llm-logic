In other words, it is not certain that the flob was skizzled.\n\nQuestion: \"Can we infer 'It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled'?\"\nThis question is asking if we can conclude that it is not necessary for the flob to have been skizzled.\n\nSince the given statement already suggests that it is not certain that the flob was skizzled, we can infer that it is not necessary for the flob to have been skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
