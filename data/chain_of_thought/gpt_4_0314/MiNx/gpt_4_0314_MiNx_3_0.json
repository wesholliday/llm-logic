It does not confirm whether the splat was morphed or not, but it allows for the possibility that it wasn't.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer: \"It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed.\" This statement is essentially saying that it is not necessary for the splat to have been morphed. In other words, there is a possibility that the splat was not morphed.\n\nComparing the two statements, we can see that they both allow for the possibility that the splat was not morphed. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
