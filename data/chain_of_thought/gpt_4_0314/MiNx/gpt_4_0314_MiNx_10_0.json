In other words, it's not certain whether the wug was sproinged or not.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the wug must have been sproinged\" - This statement negates the idea that the wug necessarily had to be sproinged. It implies that there is room for doubt or uncertainty about whether the wug was sproinged.\n\nComparing the two statements, we can see that they both express uncertainty about whether the wug was sproinged. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
