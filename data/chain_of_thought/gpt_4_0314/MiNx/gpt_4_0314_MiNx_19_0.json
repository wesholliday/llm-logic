In other words, it is not certain that the smonk was vreebled.\n\nQuestion: \"Can we infer 'It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled'?\"\nThis question is asking if we can conclude that it is not necessary for the smonk to have been vreebled.\n\nSince the given statement already suggests that it is not certain that the smonk was vreebled, we can infer that it is not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
