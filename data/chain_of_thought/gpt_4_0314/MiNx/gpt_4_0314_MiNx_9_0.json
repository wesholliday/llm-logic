It does not confirm whether the twonk was plinked or not, but it allows for the possibility that it wasn't.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer: \"It's not the case that the twonk must have been plinked.\" This statement is essentially saying that it is not necessary for the twonk to have been plinked. In other words, there is a possibility that the twonk was not plinked.\n\nComparing the two statements, we can see that they both allow for the possibility that the twonk was not plinked. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
