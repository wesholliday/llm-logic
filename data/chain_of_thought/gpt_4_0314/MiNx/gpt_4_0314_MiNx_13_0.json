It does not confirm whether the glip was slogged or not, but it allows for the possibility that it wasn't.\n\nQuestion: \"Can we infer 'It's not the case that the glip must have been slogged'?\"\nThis question is asking if we can conclude that it is not necessary for the glip to have been slogged.\n\nNow let's compare the two statements. The given statement allows for the possibility that the glip was not slogged, while the question asks if it is not necessary for the glip to have been slogged. Since the given statement suggests that there is a possibility that the glip was not slogged, it implies that it is not necessary for the glip to have been slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
