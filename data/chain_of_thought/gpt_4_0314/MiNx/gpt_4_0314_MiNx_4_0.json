In other words, it is not certain that the fribble was snurgled.\n\nStatement to infer: \"It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled\"\nThis statement implies that it is not necessary for the fribble to have been snurgled. In other words, there is no requirement or certainty that the fribble was snurgled.\n\nComparing the two statements, we can see that both imply that there is no certainty or requirement that the fribble was snurgled. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
