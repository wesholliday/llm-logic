It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned.\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the fleeg must be surned, or it is bluttered. The second statement negates the first condition, meaning that the fleeg does not have to be surned.\n\nSince we know that at least one of the conditions in the disjunction must be true, and we have eliminated the possibility of the first condition being true, we can infer that the second condition must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
