It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged.\n\nWe can represent these statements using logical notation:\n\n1. P \u2228 V (Either P or V is true)\n2. \u00acP (P is not true)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer V (The smonk is vreebled) from these statements.\n\nUsing the rules of logical inference, we can apply the Disjunctive Syllogism rule, which states that if we have P \u2228 Q and \u00acP, then we can infer Q.\n\nIn our case, we have P \u2228 V and \u00acP, so we can infer V.\n\nAnswer: yes",
