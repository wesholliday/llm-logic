It's not the case that the smip must be lupped.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two parts must be true: either the smip must be lupped, or the smip is shripped.\n\nStatement 2 negates the first part of the disjunction, meaning that the smip must be lupped is false.\n\nSince we know that at least one part of the disjunction must be true, and we know that the first part is false, we can infer that the second part must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
