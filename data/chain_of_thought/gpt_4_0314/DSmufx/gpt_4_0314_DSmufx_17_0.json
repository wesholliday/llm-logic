Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the flob is either movated or skizzled.\n\n2. It's not the case that the flob must be movated.\nThis statement negates the first possibility, meaning the flob is not movated.\n\nNow, since the first statement presents two possibilities and the second statement negates one of them, we can infer that the other possibility must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
