It's not the case that the glip must be tragged.\n\nWe can represent these statements using logical notation:\n\n1. T \u2228 S (where T represents \"the glip must be tragged\" and S represents \"the glip is slogged\")\n2. \u00acT\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer S (the glip is slogged) from these statements. Since we know that \u00acT is true, and the first statement is an \"or\" statement (T \u2228 S), we can conclude that if T is false, then S must be true in order for the entire statement to be true.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we can infer that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
