It's not the case that the wug must be bimmed.\n\nWe can represent these statements using logical notation:\n\n1. B \u2228 F (B represents \"the wug must be bimmed\" and F represents \"the wug is flooped\")\n2. \u00acB (\u00ac represents \"not\")\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer F (the wug is flooped) from these statements.\n\nSince we know \u00acB (the wug must not be bimmed) and B \u2228 F (either the wug must be bimmed or it is flooped), we can use the disjunction elimination rule. This rule states that if we have a disjunction (B \u2228 F) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false (\u00acB), then the other disjunct must be true.\n\nIn this case, since we know \u00acB, we can infer F (the wug is flooped).\n\nAnswer: yes",
