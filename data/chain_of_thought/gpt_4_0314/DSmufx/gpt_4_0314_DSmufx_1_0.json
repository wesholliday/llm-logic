It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\nStatement 1 is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two parts must be true: either the flugel must be zargled, or it is blimmed.\n\nStatement 2 negates the first part of the disjunction, meaning that the flugel must not be zargled.\n\nSince the first part of the disjunction is false, the only way for the disjunction to be true is if the second part is true. Therefore, we can infer that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
