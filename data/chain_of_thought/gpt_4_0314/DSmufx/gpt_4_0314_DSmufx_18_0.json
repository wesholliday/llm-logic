It's not the case that the shank must be nugged.\n\nWe can represent these statements using logical notation:\n\n1. N \u2228 P (where N represents \"the shank must be nugged\" and P represents \"the shank is plooked\")\n2. \u00acN\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can infer P (the shank is plooked) from these statements.\n\nSince we know that \u00acN is true (from statement 2), and we have N \u2228 P (from statement 1), we can use the logical rule of disjunction elimination (also known as the \"or-elimination\" rule) to infer P.\n\nDisjunction elimination states that if we have (A \u2228 B) and \u00acA, then we can infer B.\n\nIn this case, A is N (the shank must be nugged) and B is P (the shank is plooked). Since we have \u00acN and (N \u2228 P), we can infer P.\n\nAnswer: yes",
