It's not the case that the splat must be quanked.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the splat must be quanked, or it is morphed.\n\nStatement 2 negates the first condition, meaning that the splat must not be quanked.\n\nSince the first condition is false, the only remaining possibility for the disjunction to be true is that the second condition is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
