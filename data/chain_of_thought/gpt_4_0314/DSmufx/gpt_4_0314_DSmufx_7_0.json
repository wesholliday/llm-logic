It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two parts must be true. In this case, either the whiffle must be tinked, or it is shanked.\n\nStatement 2 negates the first part of the disjunction in Statement 1, meaning that the whiffle must not be tinked.\n\nSince the first part of the disjunction in Statement 1 is false (according to Statement 2), the only remaining possibility for the disjunction to be true is that the second part is true, which is 'the whiffle is shanked'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
