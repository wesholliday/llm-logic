It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked.\n\nWe are asked to infer if 'The fribble is snurgled' is true based on these statements.\n\nSince statement 1 is an \"either...or\" statement, it means that if one part of the statement is false, the other part must be true. Statement 2 tells us that the fribble is not crinked. Therefore, based on statement 1, the fribble must be snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
