Either the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed: This statement presents two possibilities - the flug is either zimmed or blummed.\n\n2. It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed: This statement negates the possibility of the flug being zimmed.\n\nNow, since we know that the flug cannot be zimmed, and there are only two possibilities presented in the first statement, we can infer that the only remaining possibility is that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
