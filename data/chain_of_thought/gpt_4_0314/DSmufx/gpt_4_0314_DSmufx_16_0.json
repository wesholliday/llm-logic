Either the sneg must be sproted or it is crampled.\nThis statement is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two propositions (sneg being sproted or sneg being crampled) must be true.\n\n2. It's not the case that the sneg must be sproted.\nThis statement is a negation of the first proposition (sneg being sproted).\n\nNow, let's analyze the information:\n\nSince the first statement is a disjunction, and the second statement negates one of the propositions in the disjunction, we can infer that the other proposition must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
