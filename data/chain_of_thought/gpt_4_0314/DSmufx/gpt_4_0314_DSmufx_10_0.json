It's not the case that the wug must be garpled.\n\nWe can represent these statements using logical notation:\n\n1. G \u2228 S (Either G (garpled) or S (sproinged))\n2. \u00acG (Not G)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer S (The wug is sproinged) from these statements.\n\nUsing the rules of logical inference, we can apply the Disjunctive Syllogism rule, which states that if we have a disjunction (G \u2228 S) and the negation of one of the disjuncts (\u00acG), we can infer the other disjunct (S).\n\nSo, given G \u2228 S and \u00acG, we can infer S.\n\nAnswer: yes",
