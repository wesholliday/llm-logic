It's not the case that the clug must be snugged.\n\nWe are asked if we can infer 'The clug is fleeked' from these statements.\n\nSince the first statement presents two possibilities (the clug must be snugged or it is fleeked), and the second statement negates one of those possibilities (it's not the case that the clug must be snugged), we are left with only one possibility: the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
