It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled.\n\nIn the first statement, we have two possibilities: the sprocket is daggled or the sprocket is cranked. Since these are the only two options, if one of them is false, the other must be true.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the sprocket is not daggled. Since this is the case, and we know from the first statement that either the sprocket is daggled or cranked, we can infer that the sprocket must be cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
