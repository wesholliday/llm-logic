It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two parts must be true (either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled).\n\nStatement 2 negates the first part of the disjunction (the zinger must be smoogled), which means that it is not true.\n\nSince at least one part of the disjunction must be true, and we know that the first part is not true, we can infer that the second part (the zinger is fraggled) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
