In logical terms, this can be represented as (S \u2228 V), where S stands for \"the dreb is spened\" and V stands for \"the dreb is vroombed.\"\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the dreb must be spened\" - This statement negates the first possibility, meaning the dreb is not spened. In logical terms, this can be represented as \u00acS.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"The dreb is vroombed\" (V) from these two statements.\n\nSince we have (S \u2228 V) and \u00acS, we can use the logical rule of Disjunctive Syllogism, which states that if we have (P \u2228 Q) and \u00acP, then we can infer Q.\n\nIn this case, P is S (the dreb is spened) and Q is V (the dreb is vroombed). We have (S \u2228 V) and \u00acS, so we can infer V.\n\nAnswer: yes",
