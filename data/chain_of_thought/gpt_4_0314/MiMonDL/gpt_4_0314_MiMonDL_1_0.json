            "content": "Explanation: The original statement suggests that there is a possibility that the envelope is under a bed. The second statement presents two possibilities: the envelope might be under a bed or it might be upstairs. Since the first possibility (under a bed) is already included in the original statement, adding another possibility (upstairs) does not contradict the original statement. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
