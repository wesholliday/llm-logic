When we consider the statement \"The food might be spicy or mild,\" we are essentially expanding the range of possibilities to include both spicy and mild. Since the original statement already acknowledges the possibility of the food being spicy, adding the possibility of it being mild does not contradict the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
