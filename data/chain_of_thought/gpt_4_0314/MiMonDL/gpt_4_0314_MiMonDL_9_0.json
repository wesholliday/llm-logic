However, we are not explicitly stating that it might be delayed. When we say \"The package might be delivered or delayed,\" we are acknowledging both possibilities: that the package will be delivered and that it might be delayed. Since the first statement acknowledges the possibility of delivery, it is reasonable to infer that the package might be delivered or delayed, as this statement also includes the possibility of delivery.\n\nAnswer: yes",
