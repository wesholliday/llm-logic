However, it does not explicitly state that the project might fail. Nevertheless, since there are generally only two outcomes for a project (success or failure), if there is a possibility of success, it is reasonable to assume that there is also a possibility of failure. Therefore, we can infer that \"The project might be successful or fail.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
