The statement \"The meeting might be cancelled or rescheduled\" also implies that there is a possibility of the meeting not taking place as originally planned, but it adds an additional possibility of the meeting being rescheduled. Since the first statement is included within the range of possibilities of the second statement, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
