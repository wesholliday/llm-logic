This statement does not provide any information about the possibility of the flowers being yellow. However, when we consider the statement \"The flowers might be red or yellow,\" we are simply expanding the range of possibilities to include yellow as well. Since the original statement already allows for the possibility of the flowers being red, adding another possibility (yellow) does not contradict the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
