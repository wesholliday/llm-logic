The new statement presents two possibilities: the keys might be in the drawer or on the table. Since the original statement's possibility (keys in the drawer) is included in the new statement, we can infer the new statement from the original statement, as it only adds an additional possibility (keys on the table) without contradicting the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
