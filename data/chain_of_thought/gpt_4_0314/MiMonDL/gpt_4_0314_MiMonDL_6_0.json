When we consider the statement \"The movie might be interesting or boring,\" we are essentially expanding the range of possibilities to include both interesting and boring. Since the original statement already acknowledges the possibility of the movie being interesting, adding the possibility of it being boring does not contradict or negate the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
