The statement \"The weather might be sunny or rainy\" is a more general statement that includes the possibility of the weather being sunny, as well as the possibility of it being rainy. Since the first statement already acknowledges the possibility of the weather being sunny, it is consistent with the second statement, which also includes this possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
