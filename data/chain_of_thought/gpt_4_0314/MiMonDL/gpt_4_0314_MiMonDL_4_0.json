When we consider the statement \"The cat might be sleeping or playing,\" we are introducing an additional possibility that the cat might be playing. Since the original statement already suggests that the cat might be sleeping, adding another possibility does not contradict or negate the original statement. Therefore, we can infer the combined statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
