If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger must have been smoogled.\nThis is a conditional statement: If A (the zinger was fraggled), then B (the zinger must have been smoogled).\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: Can we infer 'The zinger was not fraggled'?\n\nIf the zinger was fraggled (A), then it must have been smoogled (B). But we know from statement 1 that the zinger was not smoogled. Therefore, if the zinger was fraggled, it would lead to a contradiction with statement 1.\n\nSo, we can infer that the zinger was not fraggled to avoid this contradiction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
