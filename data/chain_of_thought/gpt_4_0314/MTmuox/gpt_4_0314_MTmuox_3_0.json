It's not the case that the splat must have quanked.\nThis statement can be represented as \u00acQ (meaning the splat did not quank).\n\n2. If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked.\nThis statement can be represented as M \u2192 Q (meaning if the splat was morphed, then it quanked).\n\nNow, we want to infer if 'The splat was not morphed' (\u00acM) is true based on these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 2 as \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acM (meaning if the splat did not quank, then it was not morphed).\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that \u00acQ is true, we can now infer that \u00acM (The splat was not morphed) is also true based on the contrapositive of statement 2.\n\nAnswer: yes",
