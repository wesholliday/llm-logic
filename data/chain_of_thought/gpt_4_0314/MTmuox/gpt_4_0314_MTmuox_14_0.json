We can represent this as \u00acS (not snugged).\n\n2. \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged\" can be represented as F \u2192 S (if fleeked, then snugged).\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can infer \"The clug was not fleeked\" or \u00acF.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite the second statement as \u00acS \u2192 \u00acF (if not snugged, then not fleeked).\n\nSince we know that the clug was not necessarily snugged (\u00acS), we can apply modus ponens and infer that the clug was not fleeked (\u00acF).\n\nAnswer: yes",
