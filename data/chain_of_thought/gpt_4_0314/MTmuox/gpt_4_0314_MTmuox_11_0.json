It's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed.\nThis means that the flug was not necessarily zimmed, or in other words, it's possible that the flug was not zimmed.\n\n2. If the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed.\nThis is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A (the flug was blummed), then B (the flug must have been zimmed).\n\nNow, we want to infer if the flug was not blummed.\n\nSince we know that it's possible that the flug was not zimmed (from statement 1), and we also know that if the flug was blummed, it must have been zimmed (from statement 2), we can conclude that the flug could not have been blummed. If it were blummed, it would have to be zimmed, which contradicts statement 1.\n\nAnswer: yes",
