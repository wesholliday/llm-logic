It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled.\nThis means that the sprocket being daggled is not a necessary condition.\n\n2. If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled.\nThis is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: Cranked \u2192 Daggled\n\nNow, we want to infer if 'The sprocket was not cranked' is true.\n\nSince we know that it's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled, we can negate the consequent of the conditional statement: \u00acDaggled\n\nAccording to the contrapositive rule, if we negate both the antecedent and the consequent and reverse their order, the statement still holds true. So, we can write the contrapositive of the given conditional statement as: \u00acDaggled \u2192 \u00acCranked\n\nNow, since we know that \u00acDaggled is true, we can infer that \u00acCranked is also true, which means 'The sprocket was not cranked'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
