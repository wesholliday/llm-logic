In other words, the twonk might or might not be varnished.\n\n2. \"If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished.\"\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If P (plinked), then Q (varnished).\n\nNow, we want to infer whether \"The twonk was not plinked\" is true or not.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the twonk might or might not be varnished. If the twonk is not varnished, then according to statement 2, it cannot be plinked. However, if the twonk is varnished, we cannot determine whether it was plinked or not based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The twonk was not plinked\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
