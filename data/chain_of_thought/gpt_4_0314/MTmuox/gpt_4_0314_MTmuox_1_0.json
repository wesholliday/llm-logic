It's not the case that the flugel must have been zargled.\nThis can be represented as: \u00acZ (meaning \"not Z\" or \"it is not the case that Z\")\n\n2. If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled.\nThis can be represented as: B \u2192 Z (meaning \"if B, then Z\")\n\nWe want to know if we can infer 'The flugel was not blimmed' from these statements, which can be represented as \u00acB.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 2 as: \u00acZ \u2192 \u00acB (meaning \"if not Z, then not B\")\n\nNow, we can see that statement 1 (\u00acZ) matches the antecedent of the contrapositive of statement 2 (\u00acZ \u2192 \u00acB). Therefore, we can infer the consequent of the contrapositive, which is \u00acB.\n\nAnswer: yes",
