If the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint.\nThis is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A (smip was shripped), then B (smip must have lupped the zoint).\n\nNow, we want to infer if 'The smip was not shripped' is true based on these statements.\n\nSince we know that the smip did not lup the zoint (from statement 1), and the conditional statement (from statement 2) tells us that if the smip was shripped, it must have lupped the zoint, we can conclude that the smip was not shripped. If it were shripped, it would have lupped the zoint, which contradicts statement 1.\n\nAnswer: yes",
