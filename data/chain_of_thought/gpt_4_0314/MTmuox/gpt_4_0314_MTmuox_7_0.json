It's not the case that the whiffle must have tinked.\nThis statement can be represented as \u00acT (where T stands for \"the whiffle must have tinked\").\n\n2. If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked.\nThis statement can be represented as S \u2192 T (where S stands for \"the whiffle was shanked\").\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The whiffle was not shanked' from these two statements. In other words, we want to know if we can conclude \u00acS.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite the second statement as \u00acT \u2192 \u00acS. This means \"if the whiffle did not tinker, then the whiffle was not shanked.\"\n\nSince we know from the first statement that \u00acT is true, we can now apply modus ponens to the contrapositive statement:\n\n\u00acT \u2192 \u00acS\n\u00acT\nTherefore, \u00acS\n\nSo, we can indeed infer 'The whiffle was not shanked' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
