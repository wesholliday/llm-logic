We can represent this as \u00ac(Fleeg surned).\n\n2. \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned\" can be represented as (Fleeg bluttered) \u2192 (Fleeg surned).\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"The fleeg was not bluttered\" from these two statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 2 as \u00ac(Fleeg surned) \u2192 \u00ac(Fleeg bluttered). The contrapositive rule states that if A \u2192 B, then \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA.\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that \u00ac(Fleeg surned) is true, we can substitute this into the contrapositive of statement 2:\n\nTrue \u2192 \u00ac(Fleeg bluttered)\n\nThis means that \u00ac(Fleeg bluttered) must also be true, which translates to \"The fleeg was not bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
