We can represent this as \u00acC (not crinked).\n\n2. If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked.\nThis is a conditional statement, which can be represented as S \u2192 C (if snurgled, then crinked).\n\nNow, we want to infer whether the fribble was not snurgled (\u00acS).\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite the second statement as \u00acC \u2192 \u00acS (if not crinked, then not snurgled).\n\nSince we know that the fribble did not necessarily crink (\u00acC), we can now use the contrapositive statement to infer that the fribble was not snurgled (\u00acS).\n\nAnswer: yes",
