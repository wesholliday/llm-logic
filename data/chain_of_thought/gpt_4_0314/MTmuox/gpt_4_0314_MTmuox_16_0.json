It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink.\nWe can represent this as: \u00acS (where S stands for \"the sneg sproted the frink\")\n\n2. If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink.\nWe can represent this as: C \u2192 S (where C stands for \"the sneg was crampled\")\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The sneg was not crampled' from these statements. In other words, we want to know if \u00acC can be inferred.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 2 as: \u00acS \u2192 \u00acC. This means \"If the sneg did not sprot the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that \u00acS is true, we can now infer \u00acC, which means \"The sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
