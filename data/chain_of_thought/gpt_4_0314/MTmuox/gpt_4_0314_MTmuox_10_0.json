It's not the case that the wug must have been garpled.\nThis statement can be represented as \u00ac(W \u2192 G), where W represents \"the wug was sproinged\" and G represents \"the wug was garpled.\" The negation symbol (\u00ac) indicates that it's not the case that if W, then G.\n\n2. If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled.\nThis statement can be represented as W \u2192 G.\n\nNow, we want to infer whether the wug was not sproinged (\u00acW) from these two statements.\n\nSince we have \u00ac(W \u2192 G) and W \u2192 G, we can use the law of contrapositive to analyze the second statement. The contrapositive of W \u2192 G is \u00acG \u2192 \u00acW, which means \"if the wug was not garpled, then it was not sproinged.\"\n\nNow, we know that it's not the case that the wug must have been garpled (\u00ac(W \u2192 G)). This means that the wug was not garpled (\u00acG). Since we have \u00acG \u2192 \u00acW, we can infer that the wug was not sproinged (\u00acW).\n\nAnswer: yes",
