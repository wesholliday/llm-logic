If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged.\nThis is a conditional statement: if A (smonk was vreebled), then B (smonk must have plagged).\n\nWe want to know if we can infer that the smonk was not vreebled (not A) from these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 2 as: if not B (smonk did not necessarily plag), then not A (smonk was not vreebled).\n\nSince statement 1 tells us that the smonk did not necessarily plag (not B), we can now apply the contrapositive of statement 2 to conclude that the smonk was not vreebled (not A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
