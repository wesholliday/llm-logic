It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink.\nThis statement can be represented as \u00acP, where P stands for \"the grommet plopped the frink.\"\n\n2. If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink.\nThis statement can be represented as S \u2192 P, where S stands for \"the grommet was sploffed.\"\n\nWe want to know if we can infer \u00acS, which means \"the grommet was not sploffed.\"\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite the second statement as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acS. This means \"if the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\"\n\nSince we know \u00acP is true from the first statement, we can substitute it into the contrapositive:\n\n\u00acP \u2192 \u00acS\nTrue \u2192 \u00acS\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
