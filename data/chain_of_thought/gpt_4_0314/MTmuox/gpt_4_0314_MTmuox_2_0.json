If the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint.\nThis is a conditional statement: If A (the wug was flooped), then B (the wug must have bimmed the zoint).\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that the wug was not flooped.\n\nSince we know that the wug did not bim the zoint (from statement 1), and the conditional statement says that if the wug was flooped, it must have bimmed the zoint (from statement 2), we can conclude that the wug was not flooped. If the wug was flooped, it would have bimmed the zoint, which contradicts statement 1.\n\nAnswer: yes",
