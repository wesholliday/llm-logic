The pants might not have been denim.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the shirt being cotton) is true, then the second part (the pants being denim) must also be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that there is a possibility that the pants were not denim.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer that the shirt was not cotton?\n\nIf the shirt was cotton, then according to statement 1, the pants must have been denim. However, statement 2 tells us that there is a possibility that the pants were not denim. This means that there is a possibility that the shirt was not cotton, but it does not definitively prove that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: no",
