Erin might not have taken a train.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Sam taking a plane) is true, then the result (Erin taking a train) must also be true. However, it does not guarantee that if the result is false, the condition must be false as well.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that there is a possibility that Erin did not take a train. This does not necessarily mean that Erin did not take a train; it just means that it's possible.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively infer that Sam did not take a plane. It is possible that Sam took a plane and Erin took a train, or that Sam did not take a plane and Erin did not take a train. We do not have enough information to make a definite conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
