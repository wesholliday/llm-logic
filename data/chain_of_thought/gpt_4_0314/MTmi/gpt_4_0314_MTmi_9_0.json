Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the second part (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\nStatement 2 introduces the possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nIf we assume that Lisa bought the red shirt, then according to statement 1, Mark must have bought the blue shirt. However, statement 2 tells us that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. This creates a contradiction, which means our initial assumption (that Lisa bought the red shirt) must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
