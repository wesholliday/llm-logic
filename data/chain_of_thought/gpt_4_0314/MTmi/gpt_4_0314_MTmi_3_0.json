If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\nThis can be represented as: If J, then M (where J = written by James, M = mystery novel)\n\n2. The book might not be a mystery novel.\nThis means that it's possible that the book is not a mystery novel, or \u00acM.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that the book was not written by James (\u00acJ) from these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 1 as: If \u00acM, then \u00acJ.\n\nSince statement 2 says that it's possible that the book is not a mystery novel (\u00acM), we can use the contrapositive of statement 1 to infer that if the book is not a mystery novel, then it was not written by James (\u00acJ).\n\nAnswer: yes",
