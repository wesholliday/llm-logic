Kate might not have eaten salad.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the second part (Kate must have eaten salad) must also be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that there is a possibility that Kate did not eat salad.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Ben ate pasta.\n- If this is true, then according to statement 1, Kate must have eaten salad. However, this contradicts statement 2, which says that Kate might not have eaten salad. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\nScenario 2: Ben did not eat pasta.\n- In this case, statement 1 does not provide any information about what Kate ate, so it is still possible that Kate might not have eaten salad, which is consistent with statement 2.\n\nSince the only scenario that is consistent with both statements is the one where Ben did not eat pasta, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
