If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\nThis statement can be represented as: If A, then C (where A represents Alex finishing the race, and C represents Chris finishing the race).\n\n2. Chris might not have finished the race.\nThis statement implies that there is a possibility that Chris did not finish the race. It does not confirm whether Chris finished the race or not.\n\nNow, we need to infer whether Alex did not finish the race based on these statements.\n\nIf we assume that Alex finished the race (A is true), then according to the first statement, Chris must have finished the race (C is true). However, this does not contradict the second statement, as it only states that there is a possibility that Chris did not finish the race, not that Chris definitely did not finish the race.\n\nOn the other hand, if we assume that Alex did not finish the race (A is false), the first statement does not provide any information about whether Chris finished the race or not. In this case, the second statement still holds true, as there is a possibility that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot definitively infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
