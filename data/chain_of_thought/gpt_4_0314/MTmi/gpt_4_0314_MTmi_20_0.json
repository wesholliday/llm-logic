(Possibility of not B)\n\nNow, we want to infer if the apple was not red (not A).\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement (If A, then B). The second statement tells us that there is a possibility that the banana was not yellow (not B). However, this does not necessarily mean that the apple was not red (not A). It could be the case that the apple was red, but the banana was not yellow due to some other reason not mentioned in the given statements.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the apple was not red based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
