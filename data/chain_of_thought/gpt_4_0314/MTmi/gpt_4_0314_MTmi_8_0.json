The mummy might not have been awake.\n\nNow let's think step by step:\n\nIf the vampire was awake, then according to statement 1, the mummy must have been awake. However, statement 2 tells us that the mummy might not have been awake. This means that there is a possibility that the mummy was not awake. If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire could not have been awake, because if the vampire was awake, the mummy would have to be awake as well (according to statement 1).\n\nSo, based on the given statements, we can infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
