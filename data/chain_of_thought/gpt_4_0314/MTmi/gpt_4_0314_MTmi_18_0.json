The truck might not have been metal.\n\nNow let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If P (doll is plastic), then Q (truck is metal).\n\nStatement 2 introduces a possibility that the truck might not have been metal, which means there is a chance that Q (truck is metal) is false.\n\nHowever, this does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the doll was not plastic (\u00acP). It is still possible that the doll was plastic and the truck was metal, or that the doll was not plastic and the truck was not metal.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The doll was not plastic' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
