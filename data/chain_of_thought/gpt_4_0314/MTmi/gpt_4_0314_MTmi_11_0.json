The muffins might not have been blueberry.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A (cake was chocolate), then B (muffins were blueberry).\n\nStatement 2 suggests that there is a possibility that B (muffins were blueberry) is false.\n\nWe are asked to infer if A (cake was not chocolate) is true based on these statements.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, if A implies B, and B is false, then A must be false. In this case, if the cake being chocolate implies that the muffins were blueberry, and the muffins might not have been blueberry (B is possibly false), then we can infer that the cake was not chocolate (A is false).\n\nAnswer: yes",
