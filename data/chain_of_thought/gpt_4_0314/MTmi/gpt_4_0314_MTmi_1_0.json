            "content": "Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If M (Mary was at the wedding), then S (Sue must have been at the wedding).\n\n2. Sue might not have been at the wedding.\nThis statement indicates that there is a possibility that Sue was not at the wedding. It does not confirm whether Sue was or was not at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's try to infer if Mary was not at the wedding based on these statements.\n\nIf we assume that Mary was at the wedding (M is true), then according to the first statement, Sue must have been at the wedding (S is true). However, the second statement tells us that there is a possibility that Sue was not at the wedding. This does not contradict the first statement, as it only says that if Mary was there, Sue must have been there too. It does not say anything about the case when Mary was not there.\n\nSince the second statement does not provide any definitive information about Sue's presence at the wedding, we cannot infer with certainty that Mary was not at the wedding based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
