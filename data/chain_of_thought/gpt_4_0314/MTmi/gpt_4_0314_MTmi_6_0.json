Bob might not have chosen pasta.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Sue choosing pizza) is true, then the second part (Bob choosing pasta) must also be true. However, it does not guarantee that if the second part is false, the first part must be false as well.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that there is a possibility that Bob did not choose pasta. It does not confirm that Bob did not choose pasta, just that it is a possibility.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively infer that Sue did not choose pizza. There is still a possibility that Sue chose pizza and Bob chose pasta, as it is not confirmed that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: no",
