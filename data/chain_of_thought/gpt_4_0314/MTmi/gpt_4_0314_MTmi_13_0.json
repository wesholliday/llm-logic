(Possibility of not B)\n\nNow, we want to infer if the car was not red (not A) from these statements.\n\nIf we assume the car was red (A), then according to statement 1, the truck must have been blue (B). However, statement 2 tells us that there is a possibility that the truck was not blue (not B). This means that there is a possibility that the car was not red (not A) to allow for the possibility of the truck not being blue (not B).\n\nAnswer: yes",
