If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\nThis statement can be represented as: If P (Joe went to the park), then Q (Lucy went to the zoo).\n\n2. Lucy might not have gone to the zoo.\nThis statement implies that it's possible that Q (Lucy went to the zoo) is false.\n\nNow, we want to infer whether Joe did not go to the park (\u00acP).\n\nIf the first statement is true (If P, then Q), and we know that it's possible that Q is false, then the only way for the first statement to still hold true is if P is also false. In other words, if Lucy might not have gone to the zoo, then it must be the case that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
