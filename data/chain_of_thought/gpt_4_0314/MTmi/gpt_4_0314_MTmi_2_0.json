The unicorn might not have been in the forest.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the griffin was in the forest) is true, then the second part (the unicorn must have been in the forest) must also be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that there is a possibility that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The griffin was in the forest.\n- According to statement 1, if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest. However, this contradicts statement 2, which says that the unicorn might not have been in the forest. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\nScenario 2: The griffin was not in the forest.\n- In this case, statement 1 doesn't give us any information about the unicorn's location, so it doesn't contradict statement 2. This scenario is possible.\n\nSince the only possible scenario is the one where the griffin was not in the forest, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
