Jen might not have watched basketball.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Tom watched football) is true, then the second part (Jen watched basketball) must also be true. However, it does not guarantee that if the second part is false, the first part must be false as well.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that there is a possibility that Jen did not watch basketball. It does not confirm that she did not watch basketball, just that it is a possibility.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively infer that Tom did not watch football. There is still a possibility that Tom watched football and Jen watched basketball, or that Tom did not watch football and Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
