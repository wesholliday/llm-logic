Amy might not have played tennis.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the result (Amy playing tennis) must also be true. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the condition is false.\n\nStatement 2 suggests that there is a possibility that Amy did not play tennis. This means that the result of the conditional statement (Amy playing tennis) might be false.\n\nNow, let's think about the question: Can we infer that Jeff did not play basketball?\n\nIf we assume that Jeff played basketball, then according to statement 1, Amy must have played tennis. However, statement 2 tells us that Amy might not have played tennis. This creates a contradiction, which means that our assumption (Jeff played basketball) must be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
