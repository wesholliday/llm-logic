If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\nThis can be represented as: If B, then W (where B represents the bear being in the cave, and W represents the wolf being in the den).\n\n2. The wolf might not have been in the den.\nThis statement implies that there is a possibility that W is false.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that the bear was not in the cave (\u00acB) based on these statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement (If B, then W). In order to infer \u00acB, we would need to know that \u00acW is true. However, the second statement only tells us that there is a possibility that \u00acW is true, not that it is definitely true.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to definitively conclude that \u00acW is true, we cannot infer \u00acB.\n\nAnswer: no",
