            "content": "Explanation: The original statement, \"The quibble might be snorked and wumbled,\" implies that there are two possible actions that can be applied to the quibble: snorking and wumbling. Since the statement does not specify that both actions must occur simultaneously or that one action depends on the other, we can infer that each action can occur independently. Therefore, it is possible for the quibble to be wumbled without being snorked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
