If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The glip was not slogged\" from these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive form of statement 2, we can rewrite it as:\n\n3. If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged.\n\nNow, we can see that statement 1 and statement 3 are related:\n\nSince the glip was not tragged (statement 1), we can use statement 3 to infer that the glip was not slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
