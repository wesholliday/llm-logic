If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint.\n\nWe are asked to infer if \"The smip was not shripped\" is true based on these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive method, we can rewrite statement 2 as:\n\n3. If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped.\n\nNow, comparing statement 1 and statement 3, we see that both have the same condition: \"The smip did not lup the zoint.\" Since this condition is true, we can infer the conclusion of statement 3, which is \"The smip was not shripped.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
