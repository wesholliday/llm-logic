If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\n\nWe are asked to infer if \"The wug was not flooped\" is true based on these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive method, we can rewrite statement 2 as:\n\n3. If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped.\n\nNow, comparing statements 1 and 3:\n\n1. The wug did not bim the zoint.\n3. If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped.\n\nSince statement 1 matches the condition in statement 3, we can infer that the wug was not flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
