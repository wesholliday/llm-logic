If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\n\nWe are asked to infer if 'The whiffle was not shanked' is true based on these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 2 as:\n\n3. If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nNow, we can see that statement 1 and statement 3 are related:\n\n1. The whiffle did not tink.\n3. If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nSince the whiffle did not tink (statement 1), we can infer that the whiffle was not shanked (statement 3).\n\nAnswer: yes",
