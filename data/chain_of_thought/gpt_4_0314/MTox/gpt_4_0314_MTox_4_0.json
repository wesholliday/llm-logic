If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\n\nWe are asked to infer if 'The fribble was not snurgled' is true based on these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule in logic, we can rewrite statement 2 as follows:\n\n3. If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nNow, we can compare statement 1 and statement 3:\n\n1. The fribble did not crink.\n3. If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nSince the fribble did not crink (statement 1), we can infer that the fribble was not snurgled (statement 3).\n\nAnswer: yes",
