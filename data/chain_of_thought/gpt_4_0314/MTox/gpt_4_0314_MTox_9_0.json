If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The twonk was not plinked\" from these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 2 as:\n\n3. If the twonk was not varnished, then it was not plinked.\n\nNow, combining statements 1 and 3:\n\nSince the twonk was not varnished (statement 1), and if the twonk was not varnished, then it was not plinked (statement 3), we can infer that the twonk was not plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
