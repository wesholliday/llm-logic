If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer that \"The fleeg was not bluttered\" from these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive method, we can rewrite statement 2 as follows:\n\n3. If the fleeg did not surn, then it was not bluttered.\n\nNow, comparing statements 1 and 3, we can see that both statements mention \"The fleeg did not surn.\" Therefore, we can infer that \"The fleeg was not bluttered\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
