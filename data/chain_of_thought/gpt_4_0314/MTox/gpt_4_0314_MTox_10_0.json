If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer 'The wug was not sproinged' from these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule in logic, we can rewrite statement 2 as follows:\n\n3. If the wug was not garpled, then it was not sproinged.\n\nNow, we can see that statement 1 and statement 3 are related. Since the wug was not garpled (statement 1), we can infer from statement 3 that the wug was not sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
