If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\n\nWe are asked if we can infer \"The sneg was not crampled\" from this information.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 2 as:\n\n3. If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\n\nNow, we can see that statement 1 and statement 3 are related:\n\n1. The sneg did not sproted the frink.\n3. If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\n\nSince the condition in statement 3 is true (the sneg did not sproted the frink), we can infer the consequence of statement 3:\n\nAnswer: yes",
