If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The dreb was not vroombed\" from these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive method, we can rewrite statement 2 in the following way:\n\n3. If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nNow, we can compare statement 1 and statement 3:\n\n1. The dreb was not spened.\n3. If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nSince statement 1 matches the condition in statement 3, we can infer the conclusion of statement 3:\n\nAnswer: yes",
