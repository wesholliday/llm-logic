If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The zinger was not fraggled\" from these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive, we can rewrite statement 2 as:\n\n3. If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nNow, we can see that statement 1 and statement 3 are related:\n\n1. The zinger was not smoogled.\n3. If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nSince the zinger was not smoogled (statement 1), we can infer that the zinger was not fraggled (statement 3).\n\nAnswer: yes",
