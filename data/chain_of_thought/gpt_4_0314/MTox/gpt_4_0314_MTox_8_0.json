If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The sprocket was not cranked\" from these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 2 as follows:\n\n3. If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nNow, we can see that statement 1 and statement 3 are related:\n\n1. The sprocket was not daggled.\n3. If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nSince the sprocket was not daggled (statement 1), we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked (statement 3).\n\nAnswer: yes",
