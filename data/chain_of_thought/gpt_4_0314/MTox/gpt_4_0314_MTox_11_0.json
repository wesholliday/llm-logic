If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The flug was not blummed\" from these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive, we can rewrite statement 2 as:\n\n3. If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed.\n\nNow, we can see that statement 1 and statement 3 are related:\n\n1. The flug was not zimmed.\n3. If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed.\n\nSince the flug was not zimmed (statement 1), we can infer that the flug was not blummed (statement 3).\n\nAnswer: yes",
