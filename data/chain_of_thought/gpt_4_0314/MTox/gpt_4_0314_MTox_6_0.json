If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nWe are asked to infer if 'The grommet was not sploffed' is true based on these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 2 as:\n\n3. If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nNow, comparing statements 1 and 3, we see that both have the same condition: \"The grommet did not plop the frink.\" Since this condition is true, we can infer the consequence of statement 3:\n\nAnswer: yes",
