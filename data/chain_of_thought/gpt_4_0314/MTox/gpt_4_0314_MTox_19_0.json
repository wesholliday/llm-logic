If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\n\nWe are asked to infer if \"The smonk was not vreebled\" from these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule in logic, we can rewrite statement 2 as:\n\n3. If the smonk did not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nNow, comparing statement 1 and statement 3, we can see that both have the same condition \"The smonk did not plagged.\" Therefore, we can infer the conclusion of statement 3, which is \"The smonk was not vreebled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
