If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\n\nWe are asked to infer if 'The splat was not morphed' is true based on these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 2 as:\n\n3. If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed.\n\nNow, we can see that statement 1 and statement 3 are related. Since the splat did not quank (statement 1), we can infer from statement 3 that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
