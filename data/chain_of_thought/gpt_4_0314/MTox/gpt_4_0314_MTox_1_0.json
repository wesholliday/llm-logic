If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\n\nWe are asked to infer if 'The flugel was not blimmed' is true based on these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 2 as follows:\n\n3. If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nNow, we can see that statement 1 and statement 3 are related:\n\n- Statement 1: The flugel was not zargled.\n- Statement 3: If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nSince the flugel was not zargled (statement 1), we can infer that the flugel was not blimmed (statement 3).\n\nAnswer: yes",
