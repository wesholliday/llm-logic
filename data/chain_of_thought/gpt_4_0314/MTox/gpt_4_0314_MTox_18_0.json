If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The shank was not plooked\" from these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 2 as follows:\n\n3. If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\n\nNow, we can see that statement 1 and statement 3 are related:\n\n1. The shank was not nugged.\n3. If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\n\nSince the shank was not nugged (statement 1), we can infer from statement 3 that the shank was not plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
