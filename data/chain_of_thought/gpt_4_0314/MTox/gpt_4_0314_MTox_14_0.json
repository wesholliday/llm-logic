If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\n\nWe are asked to infer if 'The clug was not fleeked' from these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule in logic, we can rewrite statement 2 as:\n\n3. If the clug did not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked.\n\nNow, we can see that statement 1 and statement 3 are related:\n\n- Statement 1: The clug did not snugged.\n- Statement 3: If the clug did not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked.\n\nSince the condition in statement 3 (the clug did not snugged) is true according to statement 1, we can infer the consequence of statement 3 (the clug was not fleeked).\n\nAnswer: yes",
