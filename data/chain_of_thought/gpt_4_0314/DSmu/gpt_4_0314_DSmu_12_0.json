It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\n\nFrom statement 1, we have two possibilities: A (jacket is draped over the chair) or B (jacket is hanging in the closet). Statement 2 negates the possibility B, meaning that the jacket is not hanging in the closet.\n\nSince we only have two possibilities and one of them is negated, we can infer that the other possibility must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
