It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom.\n\nWe can represent these statements using logical notation:\n\n1. A \u2228 B (A: The cat is napping on the couch, B: The cat must be playing in the bedroom)\n2. \u00acB (The cat is not necessarily playing in the bedroom)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer A (The cat is napping on the couch) from these statements.\n\nSince we know that \u00acB is true, and the first statement is A \u2228 B, we can infer that A must be true because one of the two options (A or B) must be true, and we know that B is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
