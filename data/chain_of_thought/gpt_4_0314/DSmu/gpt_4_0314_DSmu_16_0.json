It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two options must be true. In this case, either the pen is in the bag or it is on the desk.\n\nStatement 2 negates the possibility that the pen must be on the desk.\n\nSince the disjunction in Statement 1 requires that at least one of the options be true, and Statement 2 eliminates the possibility of the pen being on the desk, we can infer that the pen must be in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
