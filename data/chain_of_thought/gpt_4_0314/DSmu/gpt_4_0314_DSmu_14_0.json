Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the milk is on the counter (A) or it is chilling in the fridge (B). So, we have A or B.\n\n2. It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\nThis statement negates the possibility of the milk being in the fridge. So, we have not B.\n\nNow, we have two statements: A or B, and not B. Since we know that B is not true, the only remaining possibility is A.\n\nAnswer: yes",
