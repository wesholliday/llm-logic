Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: (A) the scarf is in the backpack, or (B) the scarf is on the coat rack.\n\n2. It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\nThis statement negates possibility (B), meaning the scarf is not on the coat rack.\n\nNow, since we have two possibilities (A and B) and we know that possibility (B) is not true, we can infer that possibility (A) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
