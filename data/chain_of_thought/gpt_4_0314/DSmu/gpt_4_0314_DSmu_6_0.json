It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen.\n\nWe can represent these statements using propositional logic:\n\n1. P \u2228 Q (where P represents \"the phone is in the living room\" and Q represents \"the phone must be ringing in the kitchen\")\n2. \u00acQ\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer P (the phone is in the living room) from these statements. Since we know \u00acQ is true, we can use the disjunction elimination rule:\n\nP \u2228 Q\n\u00acQ\nTherefore, P\n\nAnswer: yes",
