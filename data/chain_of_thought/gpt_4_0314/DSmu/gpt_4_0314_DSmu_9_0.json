It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\n\nWe can represent these statements using logical notation:\n\n1. A \u2228 B (A = The missing puzzle piece is in the box, B = The missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor)\n2. \u00acB (The missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer A (The missing puzzle piece is in the box) from these statements.\n\nSince we know \u00acB is true, we can use the disjunction elimination rule on the first statement:\n\nA \u2228 B\n\u00acB\nTherefore, A\n\nSo, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
