It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\n\nWe are asked if we can infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nSince statement 1 presents two possibilities (umbrella in the car or umbrella in the closet), and statement 2 negates one of those possibilities (umbrella not in the closet), we are left with only one possibility: the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
