It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two options must be true: either Fido is inside, or Fido must be in the garden.\n\nStatement 2 negates the second option from Statement 1, meaning that Fido doesn't have to be in the garden.\n\nSince Statement 1 tells us that at least one of the options must be true, and Statement 2 negates the second option, we can infer that the first option must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
