It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two parts must be true. In this case, either the watch is charging on the dresser, or it must be on his wrist.\n\nStatement 2 negates the second part of the disjunction, meaning that it is not true that the watch must be on his wrist.\n\nSince we know that at least one part of the disjunction must be true, and we know that the second part is not true, we can infer that the first part must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
