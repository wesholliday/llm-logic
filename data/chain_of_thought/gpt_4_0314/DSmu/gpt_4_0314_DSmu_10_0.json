Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the sock is in the laundry basket, or it is under the bed.\n\n2. It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\nThis statement negates the possibility that the sock is under the bed.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\nSince the first statement presents two possibilities, and the second statement negates one of those possibilities (under the bed), we are left with only one possibility: the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
