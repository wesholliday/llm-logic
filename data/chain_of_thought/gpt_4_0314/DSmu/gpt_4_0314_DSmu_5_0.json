It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two options must be true: either the cookies are in the jar, or they are hidden in the pantry.\n\nStatement 2 negates the second option from Statement 1, which means that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry.\n\nSince we know that at least one of the options in Statement 1 must be true, and we have eliminated the second option (cookies hidden in the pantry) based on Statement 2, we can infer that the cookies must be in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
