It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\n\nFrom the first statement, we have two possibilities: keys in the drawer (A) or keys dangling in the cabinet (B). This can be represented as A or B.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, which means B is false.\n\nSince we have A or B, and we know B is false, the only remaining possibility is A, which means the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
