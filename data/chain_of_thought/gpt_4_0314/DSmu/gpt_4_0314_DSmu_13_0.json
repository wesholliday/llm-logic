It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nFrom statement 2, we can infer that it is not necessary for the toy to be on the bookshelf. This means that the possibility of the toy being on the bookshelf is not certain.\n\nNow, let's look at statement 1. It presents two possibilities: the toy is either in the toy box or on the bookshelf. Since we know from statement 2 that the toy being on the bookshelf is not certain, the only remaining possibility is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
