It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 presents two possibilities: the remote control is either on the coffee table or hiding under the couch. Statement 2 negates one of these possibilities, stating that the remote control is not hiding under the couch.\n\nSince one of the possibilities has been negated, we are left with only one possibility: the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
