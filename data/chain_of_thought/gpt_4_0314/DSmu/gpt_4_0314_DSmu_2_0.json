Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the book is on the shelf, or the book is on the table.\n\n2. It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\nThis statement negates the possibility of the book being on the table.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information:\n\nSince the first statement presents two possibilities, and the second statement negates one of those possibilities (the book being on the table), we are left with only one possibility: the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
