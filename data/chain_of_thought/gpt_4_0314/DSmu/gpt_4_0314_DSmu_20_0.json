It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\n\nThe first statement presents two possibilities: the sunglasses are in her bag, or they are on her head. The second statement negates one of these possibilities, stating that the sunglasses are not on her head.\n\nSince there are only two possibilities presented in the first statement, and one of them has been negated by the second statement, we can infer that the remaining possibility must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
