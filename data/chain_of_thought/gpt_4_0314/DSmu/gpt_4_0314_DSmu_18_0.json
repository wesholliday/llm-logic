It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\n\nFrom statement 1, we have two possibilities: the notebook is in the drawer (A) or it must be sitting on the nightstand (B). This can be represented as A or B.\n\nStatement 2 negates the possibility of the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand (B). So, we have \u00acB.\n\nNow, we have A or B and \u00acB. Since B is not true, the only remaining possibility is A, which means the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
