If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A (apple was red), then B (banana was yellow).\n\n2. The banana was yellow.\nThis statement is a fact, which means B is true.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can deduce that the apple was red (A) from these statements.\n\nIn a conditional statement, if the antecedent (A) is true, then the consequent (B) must be true. However, knowing that the consequent (B) is true does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (A) is true. There could be other reasons for the banana being yellow that are not related to the apple being red.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot deduce that the apple was red.\n\nAnswer: no",
