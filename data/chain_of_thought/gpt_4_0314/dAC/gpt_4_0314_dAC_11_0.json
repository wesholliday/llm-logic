If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\nThis statement can be represented as: If A, then B (where A is \"the cake was chocolate\" and B is \"the muffins were blueberry\").\n\n2. The muffins were blueberry.\nThis statement is simply B.\n\nNow, we are asked if we can deduce A (the cake was chocolate) from these statements. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if A is true, then B must be true. However, knowing that B is true does not necessarily mean that A is true. There could be other reasons for B being true that are not related to A.\n\nFor example, imagine a different scenario where the cake was vanilla, but the muffins were still blueberry. In this case, B would still be true, but A would be false.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot deduce that the cake was chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no",
