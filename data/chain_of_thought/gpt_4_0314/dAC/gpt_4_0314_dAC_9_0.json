Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure of the first statement. It is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (antecedent) is true, then the second part (consequent) must also be true. However, it does not guarantee that if the second part is true, then the first part must also be true.\n\nIn this case, we know that Mark bought the blue shirt (statement 2), which is the consequent of the conditional statement. However, we cannot deduce that Lisa bought the red shirt (the antecedent) just because the consequent is true. The conditional statement only guarantees that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt, but it does not guarantee the reverse.\n\nAnswer: no",
