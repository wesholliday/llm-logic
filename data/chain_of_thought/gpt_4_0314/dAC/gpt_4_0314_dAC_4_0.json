(B)\n\nWe are asked to deduce if the alien visited Mars (A).\n\nThe given information is an example of the logical concept called \"affirming the consequent.\" This is a logical fallacy because it assumes that if the consequent (B) is true, then the antecedent (A) must also be true. However, this is not necessarily the case. There could be other reasons for the robot visiting Jupiter that are unrelated to the alien visiting Mars.\n\nTherefore, we cannot deduce that the alien visited Mars based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
