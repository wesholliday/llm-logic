Jen watched basketball.\n\nWe are asked to deduce if Tom watched football.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Tom watched football) is true, then the second part (Jen watched basketball) must also be true. However, this does not mean that if the second part is true, the first part must also be true.\n\nIn this case, we know that Jen watched basketball (statement 2), but we cannot be sure if Tom watched football or not, as there could be other reasons for Jen watching basketball. The given information does not provide enough evidence to deduce that Tom watched football.\n\nAnswer: no",
