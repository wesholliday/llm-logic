Erin took a train (Q)\n\nWe are asked to deduce if Sam took a plane (P).\n\nThe given information is in the form of a conditional statement (If P, then Q). However, we are given the consequent (Q) and asked to deduce the antecedent (P). This is a logical fallacy called \"affirming the consequent,\" which is not a valid form of argument.\n\nTherefore, we cannot deduce that Sam took a plane based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
