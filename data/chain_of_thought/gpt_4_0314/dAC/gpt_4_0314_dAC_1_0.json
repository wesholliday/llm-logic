Sue was at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true. However, this statement does not guarantee that if Sue is at the wedding, then Mary must be at the wedding as well.\n\nThe second statement tells us that Sue was at the wedding. This confirms the second part of the conditional statement, but it does not provide any information about whether Mary was at the wedding or not.\n\nSince we do not have enough information to deduce whether Mary was at the wedding or not, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no",
