The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the second part (Amy playing tennis) must also be true. However, this does not mean that if the second part is true, the first part must also be true.\n\nIn this case, we know that Amy played tennis (statement 2), but we cannot deduce from this information alone that Jeff played basketball. It is possible that Amy played tennis without Jeff playing basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
