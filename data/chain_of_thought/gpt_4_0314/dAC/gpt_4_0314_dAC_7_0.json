Chris finished the race.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Alex finishing the race) is true, then the second part (Chris finishing the race) must also be true. However, this statement does not guarantee that if Chris finished the race, then Alex must have finished the race as well.\n\nThe second statement tells us that Chris finished the race. But it does not provide any information about whether Alex finished the race or not.\n\nSince we do not have enough information to deduce whether Alex finished the race or not, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no",
