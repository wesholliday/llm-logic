The truck was metal.\n\nWe are asked to deduce if the doll was plastic.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (doll being plastic) is true, then the result (truck being metal) must also be true. However, this statement does not guarantee that the doll being plastic is the only way for the truck to be metal.\n\nThe second statement confirms that the truck is indeed metal. But this information alone does not provide any direct information about the doll.\n\nSince we do not have enough information to confirm that the doll was plastic, we cannot deduce that the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: no",
