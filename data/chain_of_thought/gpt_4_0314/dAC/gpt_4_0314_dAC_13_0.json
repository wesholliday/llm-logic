If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A, then B. In this case, A represents \"the car was red\" and B represents \"the truck was blue.\"\n\n2. The truck was blue.\nThis statement is a fact, which means B is true.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can deduce that the car was red (A) based on these statements.\n\nThe conditional statement (If A, then B) tells us that if the car was red, the truck must be blue. However, it does not tell us that the car must be red if the truck is blue. In other words, the truck being blue does not necessarily mean the car was red.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot deduce that the car was red.\n\nAnswer: no",
