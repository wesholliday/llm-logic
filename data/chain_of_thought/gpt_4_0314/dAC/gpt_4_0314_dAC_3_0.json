The book is a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure of these statements. The first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\n\nJames \u2192 Mystery\n\nwhere \"James\" represents \"the book was written by James\" and \"Mystery\" represents \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nThe second statement is a simple assertion:\n\nMystery\n\nWe are asked if we can deduce \"The book was written by James\" (James) from these two statements. To do this, we would need to use the logical rule of Modus Ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (A \u2192 B) and the antecedent (A) is true, then we can conclude that the consequent (B) is true. However, in this case, we have the consequent (Mystery) and not the antecedent (James).\n\nTherefore, we cannot deduce that the book was written by James from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
