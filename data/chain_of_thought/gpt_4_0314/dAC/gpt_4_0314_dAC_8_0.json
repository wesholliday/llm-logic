The mummy was awake.\n\nWe are asked to deduce if the vampire was awake.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: V -> M (where V represents the vampire being awake, and M represents the mummy being awake).\n\nThe second statement tells us that M is true.\n\nHowever, we cannot deduce if V is true or not based on the given information. The first statement only tells us that if V is true, then M must be true. But it doesn't tell us anything about the case when M is true on its own.\n\nAnswer: no",
