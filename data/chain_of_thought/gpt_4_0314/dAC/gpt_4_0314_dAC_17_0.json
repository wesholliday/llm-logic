The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the second part (Kate ate salad) must also be true. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the second part is true, the first part must also be true.\n\nIn this case, we know that Kate ate salad (statement 2), but we cannot deduce from this information alone that Ben ate pasta. It is possible that Kate ate salad regardless of whether Ben ate pasta or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
