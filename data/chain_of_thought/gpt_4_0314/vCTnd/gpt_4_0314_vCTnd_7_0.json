However, this does not necessarily mean that if the customer was served promptly (Q), then he was not served (not P). It is possible that the customer was served promptly (Q) and was served (P) in a different scenario.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not follow logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
