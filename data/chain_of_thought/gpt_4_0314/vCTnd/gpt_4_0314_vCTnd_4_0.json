We can represent this as:\n\nP: If S, then not D.\n\nThe conclusion is given as: If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study. We can represent this as:\n\nC: If D, then not S.\n\nNow, let's examine the logical structure of the argument. The premise states that if Ben studied (S), then he did not study diligently (not D). The conclusion, however, states that if Ben studied diligently (D), then he did not study (not S).\n\nThe argument is trying to establish a relationship between studying (S) and studying diligently (D). However, the premise and conclusion are not logically connected. The premise is about the case when Ben studied (S), while the conclusion is about the case when Ben studied diligently (D). There is no logical connection between these two cases in the argument.\n\nTherefore, the form of this argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
