However, this does not necessarily imply that whenever it's raining hard, it's not raining. The premise only tells us about the situation when it's raining, but it doesn't provide any information about the situation when it's raining hard.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion Q \u2192 (not P) does not follow logically from the premise P \u2192 (not Q).\n\nAnswer: no",
