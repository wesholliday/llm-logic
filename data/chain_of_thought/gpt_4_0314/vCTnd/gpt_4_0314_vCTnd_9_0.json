An argument is logically valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nIn this case, the premise states that if A is true, then B is true. The conclusion states that if B is false, then A is false. This is the contrapositive of the premise, which means that if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
