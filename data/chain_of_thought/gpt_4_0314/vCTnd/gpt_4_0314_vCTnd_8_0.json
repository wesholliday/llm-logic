The conclusion, however, states that if Q is false, then P is false. This is the logical form of contrapositive, which states that if P \u2192 Q is true, then \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP is also true.\n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
