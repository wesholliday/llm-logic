            "content": "Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. The premise is given as \"If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables.\" This can be represented as P \u2192 ~Q, where P represents \"I went to the store\" and Q represents \"I bought vegetables.\"\n\n2. The conclusion is \"If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store.\" This can be represented as Q \u2192 ~P.\n\n3. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion follows from the premise. In other words, we need to see if (P \u2192 ~Q) implies (Q \u2192 ~P).\n\n4. The contrapositive of a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) is (~Q \u2192 ~P). If the contrapositive is true, then the original statement is also true.\n\n5. In this case, the contrapositive of the premise (P \u2192 ~Q) is (~Q \u2192 ~P), which is the same as the conclusion (Q \u2192 ~P).\n\nSince the contrapositive of the premise is the same as the conclusion, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
