This means that if A is true, H must be false.\n\nThe conclusion states that if helpful advice was offered (H), then advice was not offered (not A). This means that if H is true, A must be false.\n\nHowever, the premise and the conclusion do not have a direct logical connection. The premise talks about the relationship between A and not H, while the conclusion talks about the relationship between H and not A. There is no clear logical progression from the premise to the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the form of this argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
