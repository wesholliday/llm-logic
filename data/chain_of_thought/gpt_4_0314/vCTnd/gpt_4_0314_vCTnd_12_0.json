The premise states that if A is true, then B must be false. The conclusion, however, states that if B is true, then A must be false. This is essentially the contrapositive of the premise.\n\nIn a logically valid argument, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. In this case, if the premise is true (If A, then not B), then the conclusion (If B, then not A) must also be true. Since the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
