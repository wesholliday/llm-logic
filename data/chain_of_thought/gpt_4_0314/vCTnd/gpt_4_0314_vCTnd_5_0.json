The contrapositive is the statement formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion of the original conditional and reversing their order.\n\nHowever, the conclusion given is Q \u2192 \u00acP, which is not the contrapositive of the premise. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
