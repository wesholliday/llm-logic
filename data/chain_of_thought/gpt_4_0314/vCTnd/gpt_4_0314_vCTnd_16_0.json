In other words, if the premise is true, does that guarantee the conclusion is true?\n\nLet's consider the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then reversing their order. So, the contrapositive of P \u2192 not Q is Q \u2192 not P.\n\nContrapositive of the premise: Q \u2192 not P\n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive of the premise with the conclusion:\n\nContrapositive of the premise: Q \u2192 not P\nConclusion: Q \u2192 not P\n\nAs we can see, the contrapositive of the premise is the same as the conclusion. Since the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, this means that if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
