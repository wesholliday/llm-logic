The premise states that if Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much. The conclusion states that if Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise at all.\n\nThe premise and the conclusion seem to be talking about two different scenarios. The premise is about Alex exercising but not much, while the conclusion is about Alex exercising much and not exercising at all. There is no direct logical connection between these two statements.\n\nTherefore, the form of this argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
