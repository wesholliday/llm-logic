The conclusion is given as: If the issue was discussed in depth (Q), then it was not discussed (not P).\n\nNow, let's examine the logical structure of the argument.\n\nThe premise is in the form of a conditional statement: P \u2192 not Q.\nThe conclusion is also in the form of a conditional statement: Q \u2192 not P.\n\nThe argument is trying to establish a relationship between the premise and the conclusion. In order for the argument to be logically valid, the conclusion must necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nIn this case, the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of a conditional statement (P \u2192 not Q) is (Q \u2192 not P). If the premise is true, then the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
