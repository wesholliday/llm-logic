If A implies not B, does it necessarily follow that B implies not A?\n\nIn this case, the answer is yes. If we know that Ann exercising (A) implies that she did not exercise strenuously (not B), then it must be true that if she exercised strenuously (B), she could not have exercised (not A). This is because the premise tells us that exercising and exercising strenuously are mutually exclusive events.\n\nAnswer: yes",
