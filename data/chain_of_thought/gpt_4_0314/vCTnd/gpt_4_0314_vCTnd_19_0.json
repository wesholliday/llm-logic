In other words, we need to check if (P \u2192 Q) \u2192 (~Q \u2192 ~P) is a tautology (always true).\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we know that if P \u2192 Q is true, then ~Q \u2192 ~P is also true. The contrapositive rule states that if a statement (P \u2192 Q) is true, then its contrapositive (~Q \u2192 ~P) is also true.\n\nSince the contrapositive rule holds for this argument, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
