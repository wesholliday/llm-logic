We are given P \u2192 Q and asked if ~Q \u2192 ~P is logically valid based on the premise.\n\nThe given argument is an example of the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then reversing their order. In this case, the contrapositive of P \u2192 Q is ~Q \u2192 ~P.\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
