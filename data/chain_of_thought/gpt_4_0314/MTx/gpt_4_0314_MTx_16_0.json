(Not B)\n\nWe want to know if we can infer 'The sneg was not crampled' (Not A).\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite the first statement as:\n\n1. If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled. (If not B, then not A)\n\nNow, we can see that the second statement (Not B) matches the condition in the contrapositive statement. Therefore, we can infer 'The sneg was not crampled' (Not A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
