The flug was not zimmed.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the flug was not blummed.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule in logic, we can rewrite statement 1 as:\n\n1a. If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed.\n\nNow, we can compare statement 1a with statement 2:\n\n1a. If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed.\n2. The flug was not zimmed.\n\nSince the condition in statement 1a (the flug was not zimmed) is true according to statement 2, we can infer the consequence of statement 1a (the flug was not blummed).\n\nAnswer: yes",
