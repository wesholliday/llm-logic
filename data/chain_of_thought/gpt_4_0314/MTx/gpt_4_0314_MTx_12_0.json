(Not B)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The smip was not shripped' (Not A) from these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 1 as:\n\n1. If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped. (If not B, then not A)\n\nSince statement 2 is 'The smip did not lup the zoint' (Not B), we can now infer 'The smip was not shripped' (Not A) based on the contrapositive of statement 1.\n\nAnswer: yes",
