(Not B)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The wug was not flooped' (Not A) from these statements.\n\nWe can use the contrapositive form of the first statement to help us. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" So, the contrapositive of the first statement is:\n\n3. If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped. (If not B, then not A)\n\nNow, we can see that statement 2 (Not B) matches the condition in statement 3 (If not B). Therefore, we can infer the conclusion of statement 3, which is 'The wug was not flooped' (Not A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
