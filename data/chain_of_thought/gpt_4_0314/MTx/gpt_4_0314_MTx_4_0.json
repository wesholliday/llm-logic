(Not B)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that the fribble was not snurgled (Not A).\n\nWe can use the contrapositive rule, which states that if a conditional statement (If A, then B) is true, then its contrapositive (If not B, then not A) is also true.\n\nSo, the contrapositive of the given statement is: If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled (If not B, then not A).\n\nSince we know that the fribble did not crink (Not B), we can infer that the fribble was not snurgled (Not A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
