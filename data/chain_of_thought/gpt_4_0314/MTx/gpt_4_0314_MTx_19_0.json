(Not B)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The smonk was not vreebled' (Not A).\n\nWe can use the contrapositive rule in logic, which states that if a statement (If A, then B) is true, then its contrapositive (If not B, then not A) is also true.\n\nSo, the contrapositive of the given statement is: If the smonk did not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled (If not B, then not A).\n\nSince we know that the smonk did not plagged (Not B), we can infer that the smonk was not vreebled (Not A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
