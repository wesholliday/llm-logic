The dreb was not spened (Not B)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that the dreb was not vroombed (Not A).\n\nWe can use the logical rule called Modus Tollens, which states that if we have \"If A, then B\" and \"Not B,\" we can infer \"Not A.\"\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n1. If the dreb was vroombed (A), then the dreb was spened (B)\n2. The dreb was not spened (Not B)\n\nApplying Modus Tollens, we can infer:\n\nAnswer: yes",
