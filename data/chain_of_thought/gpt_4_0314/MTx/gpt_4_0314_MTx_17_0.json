The flob did not movated.\n\nWe are asked to infer if 'The flob was not skizzled' is true based on these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule in logic, we can rewrite statement 1 as:\n\n1a. If the flob did not movate, then the flob was not skizzled.\n\nNow, comparing statement 1a with statement 2:\n\n1a. If the flob did not movate, then the flob was not skizzled.\n2. The flob did not movate.\n\nWe can see that the condition in statement 1a is met by statement 2. Therefore, we can infer that 'The flob was not skizzled' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
