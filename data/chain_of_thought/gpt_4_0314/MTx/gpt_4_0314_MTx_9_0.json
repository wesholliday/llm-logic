The twonk was not varnished.\n\nNow, let's use these statements to infer information about the twonk being plinked or not.\n\nStatement 1 is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the twonk was plinked) is true, then the second part (it was varnished) must also be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the twonk was not varnished. Since the second part of the conditional statement in Statement 1 is false, we can infer that the first part (the twonk was plinked) must also be false. This is because if the twonk was plinked, it would have to be varnished according to Statement 1, but we know from Statement 2 that it was not varnished.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the twonk was not plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
