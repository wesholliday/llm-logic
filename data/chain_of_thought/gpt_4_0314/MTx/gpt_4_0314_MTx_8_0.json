(Not B)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The sprocket was not cranked' (Not A) from these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 1 as:\n\n1. If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked. (If not B, then not A)\n\nSince statement 2 says 'The sprocket was not daggled' (Not B), we can now infer 'The sprocket was not cranked' (Not A) based on the contrapositive of statement 1.\n\nAnswer: yes",
