The wug was not garpled.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the wug was not sproinged.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule in logic, we can rewrite statement 1 as:\n\n3. If the wug was not garpled, then it was not sproinged.\n\nNow, we can see that statement 2 and statement 3 are related:\n\n2. The wug was not garpled.\n3. If the wug was not garpled, then it was not sproinged.\n\nSince the wug was not garpled (statement 2), we can infer from statement 3 that the wug was not sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
