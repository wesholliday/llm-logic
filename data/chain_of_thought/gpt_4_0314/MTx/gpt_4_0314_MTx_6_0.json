(Not B)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer 'The grommet was not sploffed' (Not A) from these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 1 as:\n\n1. If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed. (If not B, then not A)\n\nNow, we can see that statement 2 matches the condition in the contrapositive of statement 1:\n\n2. The grommet did not plop the frink. (Not B)\n\nSince the condition in the contrapositive is met, we can infer the conclusion of the contrapositive:\n\nAnswer: yes",
