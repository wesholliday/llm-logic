(Not Q)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer 'The shank was not plooked' (Not P) from this information.\n\nUsing the logical rule called Modus Tollens, if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the negation of the consequent (Not Q), we can infer the negation of the antecedent (Not P).\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Not Q\n\nApplying Modus Tollens, we can infer:\n\nNot P\n\nSo, we can infer 'The shank was not plooked'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
