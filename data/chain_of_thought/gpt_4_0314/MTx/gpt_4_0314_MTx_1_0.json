The flugel was not zargled.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule in logic, we can rewrite statement 1 as:\n\n1a. If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nNow, we can compare statement 1a with statement 2:\n\n1a. If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed.\n2. The flugel was not zargled.\n\nSince the condition in statement 1a (the flugel was not zargled) is true according to statement 2, we can infer the consequence of statement 1a (the flugel was not blimmed).\n\nAnswer: yes",
