(Not B)\n\nNow, we want to find out if we can infer 'The splat was not morphed' (Not A) from these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 1 as:\n\n1. If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed. (If not B, then not A)\n\nNow, combining statement 1 (in its contrapositive form) with statement 2:\n\nIf not B, then not A (If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed)\nNot B (The splat did not quank)\n\nTherefore, we can infer:\n\nAnswer: yes",
