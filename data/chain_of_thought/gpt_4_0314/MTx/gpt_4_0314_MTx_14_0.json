(Not B)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The clug was not fleeked' (Not A) from the given information.\n\nWe can use the contrapositive rule, which states that if a statement (If A, then B) is true, then its contrapositive (If not B, then not A) is also true.\n\nSo, the contrapositive of the given statement is: If the clug did not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked. (If not B, then not A)\n\nSince we know that the clug did not snugged (Not B), we can infer that the clug was not fleeked (Not A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
