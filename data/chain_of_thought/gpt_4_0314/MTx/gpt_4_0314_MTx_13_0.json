(Not T)\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can infer 'The glip was not slogged' (Not S) from these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 1 as:\n\n1. If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged. (If not T, then not S)\n\nNow, combining statement 1 (in its contrapositive form) with statement 2, we get:\n\nIf not T, then not S. (From the contrapositive of statement 1)\nNot T. (From statement 2)\n\nTherefore, we can infer:\n\nNot S. (The glip was not slogged)\n\nAnswer: yes",
