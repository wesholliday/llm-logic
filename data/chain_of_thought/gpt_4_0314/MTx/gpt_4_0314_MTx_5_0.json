The zinger was not smoogled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements using logical reasoning.\n\nStatement 1 is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A (fraggled), then B (smoogled).\n\nStatement 2 negates the consequent of the conditional statement (B), meaning that B is false (not smoogled).\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically the contrapositive, if the consequent (B) is false, then the antecedent (A) must also be false. In other words, if the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we can infer that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
