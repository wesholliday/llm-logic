Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: milk on the counter or milk in the fridge.\n\n2. The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\nThis statement tells us that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information:\n\nIf there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge, then it means that the other possibility (milk on the counter) could be true. However, the statement does not guarantee that the milk is not in the fridge; it only suggests that it might not be. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: no",
