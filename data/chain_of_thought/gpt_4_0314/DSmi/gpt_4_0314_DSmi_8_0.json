The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\n\nStatement 1 is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two options must be true. Statement 2 introduces uncertainty about the remote control being under the couch, but it does not definitively say that it is not under the couch.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to rule out the possibility of the remote control being under the couch, we cannot definitively infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: no",
