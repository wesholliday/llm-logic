The phone might not be ringing in the kitchen.\n\nFrom statement 1, we have two possibilities: \nA. The phone is in the living room.\nB. The phone is ringing in the kitchen.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it's possible that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen. This means that possibility B is uncertain.
