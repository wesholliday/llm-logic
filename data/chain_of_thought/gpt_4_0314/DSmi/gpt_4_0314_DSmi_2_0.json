Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the book is on the shelf, or it is on the table. It cannot be in any other location.\n\n2. The book might not be resting on the table.\nThis statement tells us that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. However, it does not confirm that the book is definitely not on the table.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: Can we infer 'The book is on the shelf'?\n\nSince the second statement does not confirm that the book is definitely not on the table, we cannot definitively conclude that the book is on the shelf. There is still a possibility that the book is on the table.\n\nAnswer: no",
