Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\nThis statement tells us that there are two possibilities for the location of the toy: in the toy box or on the bookshelf.\n\n2. The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\nThis statement tells us that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information:\n\nIf there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf, then it means that the toy could be in the toy box. However, since the statement only says \"might not be,\" it doesn't completely rule out the possibility that the toy is on the bookshelf. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: no",
