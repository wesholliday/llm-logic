Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the scarf is in the backpack (A) or it is on the coat rack (B). So, A or B.\n\n2. The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack.\nThis statement tells us that it's possible that the scarf is not on the coat rack (\u00acB).\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack (A) based on these statements.\n\nSince we know that either A or B must be true, and we also know that \u00acB is a possibility, we can infer that if \u00acB is true, then A must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
