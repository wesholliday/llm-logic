The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are two possibilities: the puzzle piece is in the box, or it is blending in on the floor. Statement 2 tells us that it is possible that the puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor. However, this does not guarantee that the puzzle piece is in the box, as it only states that it might not be on the floor. There is still a possibility that it is blending in on the floor.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: no",
