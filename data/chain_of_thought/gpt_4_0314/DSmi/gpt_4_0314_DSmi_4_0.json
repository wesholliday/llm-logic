Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the cat is napping on the couch, or the cat is playing in the bedroom. One of these must be true.\n\n2. The cat might not be playing in the bedroom.\nThis statement tells us that there is a possibility that the cat is not playing in the bedroom. However, it does not confirm that the cat is definitely not playing in the bedroom.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer 'The cat is napping on the couch'?\n\nSince the second statement does not confirm that the cat is definitely not playing in the bedroom, we cannot be certain that the cat is napping on the couch. It is still possible that the cat is playing in the bedroom.\n\nAnswer: no",
