Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: Fido is either inside the house or in the garden. There are no other options mentioned.\n\n2. Fido might not be in the garden.\nThis statement tells us that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. However, it does not confirm that Fido is definitely not in the garden.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: Can we infer 'Fido is inside'?\n\nGiven the information from statement 2, we know that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. However, this statement does not confirm that Fido is definitely not in the garden. Since we do not have enough information to rule out the possibility of Fido being in the garden, we cannot definitively infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: no",
