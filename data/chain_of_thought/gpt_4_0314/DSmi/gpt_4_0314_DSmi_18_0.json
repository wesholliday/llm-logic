Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the notebook is in the drawer (A) or it is on the nightstand (B). So, A or B.\n\n2. The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\nThis statement tells us that there is a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand (\u00acB).\n\nNow, we want to infer if the notebook is in the drawer (A).\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that either A or B is true. Since statement 2 tells us that there is a possibility that \u00acB is true, we cannot definitively conclude that A (the notebook is in the drawer) is true. There is still a possibility that the notebook is on the nightstand, even though it might not be.\n\nAnswer: no",
