Erin took a train (Q)\n\nWe are asked to infer if Sam took a plane (P).\n\nThe given information is an example of the logical form called \"affirming the consequent,\" which is a logical fallacy. It means that just because the consequent (Q) is true, we cannot necessarily conclude that the antecedent (P) is true. In other words, even though Erin took a train, it doesn't necessarily mean that Sam took a plane.\n\nAnswer: no",
