If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A (apple was red), then B (banana was yellow).\n\n2. The banana was yellow.\nThis statement is a fact, which can be represented as: B (banana was yellow).\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that the apple was red (A) from these statements.\n\nThe conditional statement (If A, then B) tells us that if the apple was red, the banana would be yellow. However, it does not tell us that the apple being red is the only condition for the banana being yellow. In other words, the banana being yellow could be a result of other factors as well.\n\nSince we only know that the banana was yellow (B) and we don't have any information about the apple being red (A) or any other conditions, we cannot infer that the apple was red based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
