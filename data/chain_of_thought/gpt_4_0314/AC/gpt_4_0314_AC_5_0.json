If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If J, then A. This means that if Jeff played basketball, it is guaranteed that Amy played tennis. However, it does not guarantee that if Amy played tennis, Jeff must have played basketball.\n\n2. Amy played tennis.\nThis statement tells us that A is true.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that Jeff played basketball (J) from these two statements.\n\nThe first statement (If J, then A) does not guarantee that if A is true, then J must be true. It only guarantees that if J is true, then A must be true. Since we know that A is true, we cannot directly infer that J is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
