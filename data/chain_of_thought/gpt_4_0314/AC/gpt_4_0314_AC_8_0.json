The mummy was awake.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the vampire was awake.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: V -> M (If V is true, then M is true). However, this statement does not guarantee that if M is true, then V must be true. It only tells us that if V is true, then M must be true.\n\nThe second statement tells us that M is true. But we cannot infer from the given information that V must be true. It is possible that the mummy was awake for some other reason, and the vampire was not awake.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the vampire was awake. \n\nAnswer: no",
