Jen watched basketball.\n\nWe are asked to infer if Tom watched football.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Tom watched football) is true, then the second part (Jen watched basketball) must also be true. However, this does not mean that if the second part is true, the first part must also be true.\n\nIn this case, we know that Jen watched basketball (statement 2), but we cannot infer that Tom watched football based on this information alone. The conditional statement does not provide enough information to make this conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
