Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Joe going to the park) is true, then the second part (Lucy going to the zoo) must also be true. However, this does not mean that if the second part is true, the first part must also be true.\n\nIn this case, we know that Lucy went to the zoo (statement 2), but we cannot infer that Joe went to the park just because Lucy went to the zoo. There could be other reasons for Lucy going to the zoo that are not related to Joe going to the park.\n\nAnswer: no",
