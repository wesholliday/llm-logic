The truck was blue.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logic:\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the car being red) is true, then the consequence (the truck being blue) must also be true. However, this statement does not guarantee that the car being red is the only way for the truck to be blue.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the truck is indeed blue. But it does not provide any information about the color of the car.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot definitively infer that the car was red.\n\nAnswer: no",
