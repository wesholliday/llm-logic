The pants were denim.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the shirt was cotton.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the shirt being cotton) is true, then the second part (the pants being denim) must also be true. However, this does not mean that if the second part is true, the first part must also be true.\n\nIn this case, we know that the pants were denim (statement 2), but we do not have enough information to determine whether the shirt was cotton. The shirt being cotton is a sufficient condition for the pants being denim, but it is not a necessary condition. There could be other reasons for the pants being denim.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the shirt was cotton based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
