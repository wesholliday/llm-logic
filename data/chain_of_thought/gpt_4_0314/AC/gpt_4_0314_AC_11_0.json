The muffins were blueberry.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure of these statements. The first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\n\nIf A (cake was chocolate), then B (muffins were blueberry).\n\nThe second statement is a simple statement:\n\nB (muffins were blueberry).\n\nWe are asked to infer if A (cake was chocolate) is true based on these statements. However, the given information only tells us that if A is true, then B is true. It does not tell us that if B is true, then A must be true. This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the cake was chocolate based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
