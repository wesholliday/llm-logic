If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A, then B. Here, A is \"the book was written by James\" and B is \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\n2. The book is a mystery novel.\nThis statement tells us that B is true.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer A (the book was written by James) from these statements.\n\nThe given conditional statement (If A, then B) tells us that if A is true, then B must be true. However, it does not tell us that if B is true, then A must be true. In other words, we cannot infer the cause (A) from the effect (B) in this case.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the book was written by James just because it is a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: no",
