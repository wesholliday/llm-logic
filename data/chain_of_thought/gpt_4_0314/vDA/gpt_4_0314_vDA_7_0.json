(Not A)\n\nConclusion: Chris did not finish the race. (Not B)\n\nThis form of argument is known as denying the antecedent. It is not logically valid because it is possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false. For example, it could be the case that Alex did not finish the race, but Chris still finished the race. The premises do not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. \n\nAnswer: no",
