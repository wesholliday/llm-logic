The book was not written by James.\n\nNow, we need to determine if the conclusion \"The book is not a mystery novel\" logically follows from these premises.\n\nThe argument is in the form of a modus tollens, which is a valid argument form. However, in this case, the conclusion does not follow the modus tollens pattern. Modus tollens would have the following structure:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nApplying this to the given argument:\n\n1. If the book was written by James (P), then the book is a mystery novel (Q).\n2. The book was not written by James (not P).\n\nThe conclusion should be about the negation of Q (not a mystery novel), but the second premise is about the negation of P (not written by James). Therefore, the argument does not follow the modus tollens pattern, and we cannot conclude that the book is not a mystery novel based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
