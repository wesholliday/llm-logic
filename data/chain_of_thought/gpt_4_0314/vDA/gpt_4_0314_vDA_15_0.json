(Premise 2)\n\nNow, we need to determine if the conclusion \"Erin did not take a train\" logically follows from these premises.\n\nThe argument is in the form of a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the negation of the antecedent (Not P). However, the conclusion is the negation of the consequent (Not Q). This form of argument is known as denying the antecedent, which is a logical fallacy. It is not valid because it is possible for the antecedent to be false and the consequent to be true.\n\nIn this case, just because Sam did not take a plane (Not P) does not necessarily mean that Erin did not take a train (Not Q). Erin could have taken a train for other reasons unrelated to Sam taking a plane.\n\nAnswer: no",
