(Not A)\n\nNow, we need to determine if the conclusion, \"The robot did not visit Jupiter\" (Not B), logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument is in the form of denying the antecedent, which is a logical fallacy. Denying the antecedent occurs when the first premise is a conditional statement (If A, then B), and the second premise denies the antecedent (Not A), but the conclusion denies the consequent (Not B). This form of argument is not logically valid because it is possible for the consequent (B) to be true even if the antecedent (A) is false.\n\nIn this case, just because the alien did not visit Mars (Not A) does not necessarily mean that the robot did not visit Jupiter (Not B). The robot could have visited Jupiter for other reasons unrelated to the alien visiting Mars.\n\nAnswer: no",
