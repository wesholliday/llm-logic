(Premise 2)\n\nNow, we need to determine if the conclusion \"Kate did not eat salad\" logically follows from these premises.\n\nThe argument is in the form of a modus tollens, which is a valid argument form. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the negation of the consequent (Not Q), we can infer the negation of the antecedent (Not P).\n\nHowever, in this case, we have the negation of the antecedent (Not P) instead of the negation of the consequent (Not Q). So, we cannot directly infer the negation of the consequent (Not Q) from the given premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
