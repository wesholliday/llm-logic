(Not A)\n\nConclusion: The banana was not yellow. (Not B)\n\nThis form of argument is known as denying the antecedent. In this case, we are given that if A is true, then B is true. However, we are also given that A is false. From this information, we cannot draw any conclusion about the truth value of B. B could be true or false, regardless of whether A is true or false.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
