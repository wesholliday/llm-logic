(Not P)\n\nNow, we need to determine if the conclusion \"The truck was not blue\" (Not Q) logically follows from these premises.\n\nThe argument is trying to use the form of Modus Tollens, which is:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Not Q\nConclusion: Not P\n\nHowever, the given argument is not in the form of Modus Tollens. Instead, it is in the form:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Not P\nConclusion: Not Q\n\nThis form of argument is not logically valid because it is possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false. For example, it could be the case that if the car was red, the truck would be blue, but since the car is not red, the truck could still be blue or any other color.\n\nSo, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
