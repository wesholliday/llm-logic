(Not P)\n\nNow, we want to determine if the conclusion \"Amy did not play tennis\" (Not Q) logically follows from these premises.\n\nThe argument is in the form of denying the antecedent, which is a logical fallacy. Denying the antecedent occurs when the first premise is a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the second premise denies the antecedent (Not P), but the conclusion denies the consequent (Not Q). This form of argument is not logically valid because it is possible for the conclusion to be false even if the premises are true.\n\nIn this case, just because Jeff did not play basketball, it does not necessarily mean that Amy did not play tennis. Amy could have played tennis for other reasons, unrelated to Jeff playing basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
