(Not A)\n\nNow, we need to determine if the conclusion \"The pants were not denim\" (Not B) logically follows from these premises.\n\nThe argument is in the form of denying the antecedent (Not A). However, denying the antecedent does not necessarily mean that the consequent (B) is false. It is possible that the pants were denim even if the shirt was not cotton. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
