(Premise 2)\n\nNow, we need to determine if the conclusion \"Bob did not choose pasta\" logically follows from these premises.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Sue choosing pizza) is true, then the consequent (Bob choosing pasta) must also be true. However, the second premise tells us that Sue did not choose pizza, which means the antecedent is false.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement does not provide any information about what happens when the antecedent is false. It is possible that Bob chose pasta or that he did not choose pasta. Since we cannot definitively conclude that \"Bob did not choose pasta\" based on the given premises, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
