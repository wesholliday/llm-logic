(Premise 2)\n\nNow, we need to determine if the conclusion \"Sue was not at the wedding\" logically follows from these premises.\n\nThe argument is in the form of a conditional statement (If P, then Q). The first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding (P), then Sue was at the wedding (Q). The second premise states that Mary was not at the wedding (~P). \n\nHowever, the conclusion is trying to draw a connection between Mary not being at the wedding (~P) and Sue not being at the wedding (~Q). This is a logical fallacy called \"denying the antecedent.\" The argument assumes that if the antecedent (P) is false, then the consequent (Q) must also be false, which is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, the form of this argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
