(Premise 2)\n\nNow, we need to determine if the conclusion \"Jen did not watch basketball\" logically follows from these premises.\n\nThe argument is in the form of a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and a negation of the antecedent (not P). The conclusion is a negation of the consequent (not Q). This form of argument is known as denying the antecedent, which is a logical fallacy. It is not valid because it is possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false. For example, it could be the case that Tom did not watch football, but Jen still watched basketball for some other reason.\n\nSo, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
