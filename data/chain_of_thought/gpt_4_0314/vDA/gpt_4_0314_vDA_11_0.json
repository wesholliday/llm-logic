(Not P)\n\nConclusion: The muffins were not blueberry. (Not Q)\n\nThis form of argument is known as denying the antecedent, which is a logical fallacy. The argument is not logically valid because it is possible for the cake not to be chocolate and still have the muffins be blueberry. The premises do not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. \n\nAnswer: no",
