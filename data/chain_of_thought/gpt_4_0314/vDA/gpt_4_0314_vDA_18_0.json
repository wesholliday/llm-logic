(Not P)\n\nNow, we need to determine if the conclusion \"The truck was not metal\" (Not Q) logically follows from these premises.\n\nThe argument is in the form of denying the antecedent (Not P), but the conclusion is denying the consequent (Not Q). This form of argument is not logically valid because it does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion based on the premises. In other words, even if the doll was not plastic, it does not necessarily mean that the truck was not metal.\n\nAnswer: no",
