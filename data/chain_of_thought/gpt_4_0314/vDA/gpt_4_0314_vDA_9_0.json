(Premise 2)\n\nNow, we need to determine if the conclusion \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" logically follows from these premises.\n\nThe argument is in the form of modus tollens, which is a valid argument form. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (if P, then Q) and the negation of the consequent (not Q), we can infer the negation of the antecedent (not P).\n\nHowever, in this case, we have the negation of the antecedent (not P) and we are trying to infer the negation of the consequent (not Q). This is a fallacy known as denying the antecedent, which is not a valid argument form.\n\nSo, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
