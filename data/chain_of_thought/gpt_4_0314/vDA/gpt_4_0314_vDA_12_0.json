(Premise 2)\n\nNow, we want to determine if the conclusion \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\" logically follows from these premises.\n\nThe argument is in the form of a modus tollens, which is a valid argument form. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the negation of the consequent (Not Q), we can conclude the negation of the antecedent (Not P).\n\nHowever, in this case, we have the negation of the antecedent (Not P) and we want to conclude the negation of the consequent (Not Q). This is a fallacy called denying the antecedent, which is not a valid argument form.\n\nSo, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
