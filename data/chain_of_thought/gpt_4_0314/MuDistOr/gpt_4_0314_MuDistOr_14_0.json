This means that there are only two possibilities for the payment method. The rephrased statement also presents the same two possibilities, stating that the payment must have been made by credit card or it must have been made by bank transfer. Both statements convey the same meaning, which is that the payment must have been made using one of these two methods.\n\nAnswer: yes",
