The use of \"or\" indicates that the book must be in one of these two locations. The rephrased statement, \"The book must have been on the shelf or it must have been in the backpack,\" also presents the same two possible locations for the book, with the same implication that it must be in one of these locations. Both statements convey the same meaning, so we can infer the rephrased statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
