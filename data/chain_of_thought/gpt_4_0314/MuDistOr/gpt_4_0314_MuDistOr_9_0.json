            "content": "Explanation: The original statement, \"The package must have been delivered by truck or by plane,\" implies that there are only two possible methods of delivery for the package: truck or plane. This means that either the package was delivered by truck, or it was delivered by plane. The rephrased statement, \"The package must have been delivered by truck or it must have been delivered by plane,\" conveys the same meaning, as it also presents the two possible methods of delivery for the package. Therefore, we can infer the rephrased statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
