This means that the password must have at least one of these two elements: a number or a special character. The rephrased statement says that the password must have contained a number or it must have contained a special character. This rephrased statement also means that the password must have at least one of these two elements: a number or a special character. Since both statements convey the same meaning, we can infer the rephrased statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
