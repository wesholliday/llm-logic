Here, P represents \"Tom watched football\" and Q represents \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nNow, we want to infer if the following statement is true: \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\" This can be represented as: If not P, then not Q.\n\nTo determine if we can infer this statement from the given statement, we need to see if the truth of the given statement guarantees the truth of the inferred statement.\n\nHowever, the given statement (If P, then Q) does not provide any information about what happens when P is false (i.e., when Tom did not watch football). It is possible that Jen watched basketball even if Tom did not watch football, or she did not watch basketball. We cannot make a definite conclusion about the inferred statement based on the given statement.\n\nSo, we cannot infer \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
