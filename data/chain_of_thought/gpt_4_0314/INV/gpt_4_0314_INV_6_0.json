(where P represents Sue choosing pizza, and Q represents Bob choosing pasta)\n\nNow, we are asked to infer: If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\nThis can be represented as: If not P, then not Q.\n\nTo determine if we can infer this new statement from the given statement, let's look at the contrapositive of the given statement. The contrapositive is formed by negating both P and Q and reversing their order. So, the contrapositive of the given statement would be: If not Q, then not P.\n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive (If not Q, then not P) with the statement we are asked to infer (If not P, then not Q). We can see that these two statements are not equivalent. The contrapositive tells us what happens if Bob did not choose pasta, while the statement we are asked to infer tells us what happens if Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
