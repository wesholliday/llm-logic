The contrapositive is formed by negating both the antecedent (V) and the consequent (M) and reversing their order.\n\nContrapositive: If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\nSymbolically, this can be represented as: ~M -> ~V (where ~M represents the mummy not being awake, and ~V represents the vampire not being awake)\n\nThe contrapositive is logically equivalent to the given statement. However, the contrapositive is not the same as the statement we want to infer: \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake\" (~V -> ~M).\n\nSince the contrapositive is not the same as the statement we want to infer, we cannot infer \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
