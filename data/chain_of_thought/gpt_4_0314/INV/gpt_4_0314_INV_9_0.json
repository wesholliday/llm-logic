(A = Lisa bought the red shirt, B = Mark bought the blue shirt)\n\nNow, we need to determine if the following statement can be inferred from the given statement: If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\nThis can be represented as: If not A, then not B. (not A = Lisa did not buy the red shirt, not B = Mark did not buy the blue shirt)\n\nThe given statement (If A, then B) does not provide enough information to infer the statement (If not A, then not B). The given statement only tells us what happens when A is true, but it does not tell us what happens when A is false. It is possible that Mark still bought the blue shirt even if Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement 'If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
