So, the contrapositive of P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nContrapositive: If the truck was not metal (\u00acQ), then the doll was not plastic (\u00acP).\n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive with the statement we want to infer:\nIf the doll was not plastic (\u00acP), then the truck was not metal (\u00acQ).\n\nAs we can see, the statement we want to infer is not the same as the contrapositive of the given statement. The contrapositive is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, while the statement we want to infer is \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement 'If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal' from the given statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'.\n\nAnswer: no",
