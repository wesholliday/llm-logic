However, the statement we are asked to infer is different from the contrapositive.\n\nThe statement we are asked to infer: If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\nSymbolically, this is: If not C, then not B.\n\nComparing the contrapositive (If not B, then not C) with the statement we are asked to infer (If not C, then not B), we can see that they are not the same. Therefore, we cannot infer the given statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
