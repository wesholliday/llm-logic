(A = shirt was cotton, B = pants were denim)\n\nNow, we want to infer if the following statement is true: \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\"\n\nThis can be represented as: If not A, then not B. (not A = shirt was not cotton, not B = pants were not denim)\n\nThe original statement (If A, then B) does not provide enough information to conclude that the inverse statement (If not A, then not B) is true. The inverse statement might be true, but we cannot infer it from the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
