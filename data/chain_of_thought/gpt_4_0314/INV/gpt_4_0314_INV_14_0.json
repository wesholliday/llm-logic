The contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" So, the contrapositive of the given statement is: If not W, then not B.\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den\" from the given statement. Symbolically, this is: If not B, then not W.\n\nComparing the contrapositive (If not W, then not B) with the statement we want to infer (If not B, then not W), we can see that they are not the same. The contrapositive does not allow us to infer the statement in question.\n\nAnswer: no",
