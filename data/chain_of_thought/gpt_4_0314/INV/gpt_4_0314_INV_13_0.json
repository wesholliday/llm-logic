In this case, P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\"\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer the following statement: \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\"\n\nThis statement can be represented as: If not P, then not Q.\n\nTo determine if we can infer this statement from the original statement, we need to consider the truth values of P and Q.\n\nIf P is true (the car was red), then Q is true (the truck was blue) according to the given statement. However, if P is false (the car was not red), we don't have any information about the truth value of Q (the truck being blue or not blue).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
