In this case, P \u2192 Q is still true because the statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" is not violated. However, \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ is false because Ben did not eat pasta, but Kate still ate salad.\n\nSince there is a case where P \u2192 Q is true but \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ is false, we cannot infer \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ from P \u2192 Q.\n\nAnswer: no",
