The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then reversing their order. So, the contrapositive of P \u2192 Q is ~Q \u2192 ~P.\n\nNotice that the contrapositive of P \u2192 Q is not the same as the statement we want to infer (~P \u2192 ~Q). The contrapositive states that \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane,\" which is different from \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\"\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
