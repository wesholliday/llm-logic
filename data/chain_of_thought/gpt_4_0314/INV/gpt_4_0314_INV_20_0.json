However, it does not provide any information about the color of the banana if the apple is not red. The banana could still be yellow or it could be a different color.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the new statement (If not P, then not Q) from the original statement, as there is not enough information provided about the relationship between the apple not being red and the color of the banana.\n\nAnswer: no",
