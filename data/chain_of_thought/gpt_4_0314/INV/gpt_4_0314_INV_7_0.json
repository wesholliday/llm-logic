The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then reversing their order. \n\nContrapositive: If Chris didn't finish the race, then Alex didn't finish the race.\nSymbolically, this can be represented as \u00acC \u2192 \u00acA, where \u00acC represents \"Chris didn't finish the race\" and \u00acA represents \"Alex didn't finish the race.\"\n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive with the statement we want to infer: If Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race (\u00acA \u2192 \u00acC).\n\nAs we can see, the contrapositive (\u00acC \u2192 \u00acA) is not the same as the statement we want to infer (\u00acA \u2192 \u00acC). Therefore, we cannot infer the given statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
