(A: the book was written by James, B: the book is a mystery novel)\n\nStatement to infer: If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\nThis can be represented as: If not A, then not B. (not A: the book was not written by James, not B: the book is not a mystery novel)\n\nNow, let's analyze the logic. The given statement tells us that if the book was written by James, it must be a mystery novel. However, it does not provide any information about the genre of the book if it was not written by James. It is possible that a book not written by James could still be a mystery novel, or it could be a different genre.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
