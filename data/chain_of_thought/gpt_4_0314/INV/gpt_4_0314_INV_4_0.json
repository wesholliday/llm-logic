The contrapositive is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and reversing their order. So, the contrapositive of the given statement would be: If not B, then not A.\n\nComparing the contrapositive (If not B, then not A) with the statement we want to infer (If not A, then not B), we can see that they are not the same. Therefore, we cannot infer the statement 'If the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
