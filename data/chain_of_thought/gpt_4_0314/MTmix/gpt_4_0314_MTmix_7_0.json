(Possibility of not B)\n\nWe are asked to infer if 'The whiffle was not shanked' (not A) is true.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 1 as: If the whiffle did not tinker, then the whiffle was not shanked. (If not B, then not A)\n\nSince there is a possibility of not B (The whiffle might not have tinked), we can infer that there is a possibility of not A (The whiffle was not shanked).\n\nAnswer: yes",
