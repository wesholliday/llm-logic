(Possibility of not B)\n\nNow, we want to infer if 'The splat was not morphed' (not A) is true.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 1 as:\n\n1. If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed. (If not B, then not A)\n\nSince statement 2 suggests the possibility of not B, and statement 1 (in contrapositive form) says that if not B, then not A, we can infer that there is a possibility that the splat was not morphed.\n\nHowever, this does not guarantee that the splat was not morphed, as it is only a possibility. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that 'The splat was not morphed'.\n\nAnswer: no",
