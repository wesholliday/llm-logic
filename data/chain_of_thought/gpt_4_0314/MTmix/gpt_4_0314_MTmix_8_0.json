The sprocket might not have been daggled.\nThis statement implies that there is a possibility that B is false.\n\nNow, we want to infer if 'The sprocket was not cranked' (i.e., A is false) from these statements.\n\nIf we know that \"If A, then B\" is true and B might be false, we cannot definitively conclude that A is false. There is still a possibility that A is true, but B is false for some other reason.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot infer that 'The sprocket was not cranked'.\n\nAnswer: no",
