The flugel might not have been zargled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\nStatement 1 is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the flugel was blimmed) is true, then the second part (the flugel must have been zargled) must also be true.\n\nStatement 2 introduces uncertainty about whether the flugel was zargled or not. It doesn't say that the flugel was definitely not zargled, just that it might not have been.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, we cannot definitively infer that the flugel was not blimmed. It's possible that the flugel was blimmed and zargled, or that it was not blimmed and not zargled. We don't have enough information to make a definite conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
