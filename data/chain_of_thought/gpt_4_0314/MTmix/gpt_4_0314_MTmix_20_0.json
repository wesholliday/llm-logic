(Possibility of not B)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The fleeg was not bluttered' (not A) from these statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement (If A, then B). The second statement tells us that there is a possibility that B is not true. However, this does not give us enough information to definitively conclude that A is not true.\n\nFor example, consider the following statements:\n\n1. If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\n2. It might not be wet outside.\n\nFrom these statements, we cannot definitively conclude that it is not raining. There could be other reasons for the ground to be wet, or it could be that it is raining but the ground hasn't become wet yet.\n\nSimilarly, in our original problem, we cannot definitively conclude that the fleeg was not bluttered based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
