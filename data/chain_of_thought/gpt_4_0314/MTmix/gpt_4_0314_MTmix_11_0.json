(Possibility of Not Zimmed)\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the flug was blummed, it must have been zimmed. However, statement 2 tells us that there is a possibility that the flug was not zimmed.\n\nIf there is a possibility that the flug was not zimmed, then it means that there is a possibility that the flug was not blummed, because if it were blummed, it would have to be zimmed according to statement 1.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we can infer that the flug was not blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
