If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked.\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A (snurgled), then B (crinked).\n\n2. The fribble might not have crinked.\nThis statement tells us that it's possible that B (crinked) is false.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that the fribble was not snurgled (A is false) based on these statements.\n\nIn a conditional statement, if A is true, then B must be true. However, if B is false, we cannot definitively say whether A is true or false. In this case, since we only know that it's possible for B to be false, we cannot definitively conclude that A is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the fribble was not snurgled based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
