The grommet might not have plopped the frink. (Possibility of not B)\n\nWe are asked to infer if the grommet was not sploffed (not A).\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, if not B, then not A. Since there is a possibility of not B, there is also a possibility of not A. However, this does not definitively prove that the grommet was not sploffed, as there could still be a possibility that it was sploffed.\n\nAnswer: no",
