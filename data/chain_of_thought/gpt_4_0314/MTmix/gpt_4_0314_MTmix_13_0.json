(Possibly not T)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The glip was not slogged\" (not S) from these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 1 as:\n\n1'. If the glip did not tragg, then the glip was not slogged. (If not T, then not S)\n\nNow, let's consider statement 2. It says that it's possible that the glip did not tragg (possibly not T). However, this statement does not guarantee that the glip did not tragg; it only suggests that it's a possibility.\n\nSince we don't have a definitive statement about the glip not tragging (not T), we cannot directly apply the contrapositive (1') to infer that the glip was not slogged (not S).\n\nAnswer: no",
