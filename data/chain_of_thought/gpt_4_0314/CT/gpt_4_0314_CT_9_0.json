            "content": "Let's break down the given statement and the statement we want to infer:\n\nGiven statement: If Lisa bought the red shirt (A), then Mark bought the blue shirt (B).\nThis can be represented as A \u2192 B.\n\nStatement to infer: If Mark did not buy the blue shirt (~B), then Lisa did not buy the red shirt (~A).\nThis can be represented as ~B \u2192 ~A.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship between these statements. The statement to infer is the contrapositive of the given statement. The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then reversing their order. In this case, the contrapositive of A \u2192 B is ~B \u2192 ~A.\n\nIn logic, a statement and its contrapositive are always logically equivalent. This means that if the given statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nSince the statement to infer is the contrapositive of the given statement, we can infer it from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
