So, the contrapositive of P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be: If Kate did not eat the salad (\u00acQ), then Ben did not eat pasta (\u00acP).\n\nSo, based on the contrapositive, we can infer the statement 'If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
