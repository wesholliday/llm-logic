            "content": "Let's break down the given statement and the statement we want to infer:\n\nGiven statement: If the vampire was awake (V), then the mummy was awake (M).\nThis can be represented as: V \u2192 M\n\nStatement to infer: If the mummy was not awake (\u00acM), then the vampire was not awake (\u00acV).\nThis can be represented as: \u00acM \u2192 \u00acV\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship between these two statements. The statement we want to infer is the contrapositive of the given statement. The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then reversing their order. In this case, the contrapositive of V \u2192 M is \u00acM \u2192 \u00acV.\n\nIn logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if one is true, the other must also be true. Therefore, since the given statement is true, we can infer that its contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
