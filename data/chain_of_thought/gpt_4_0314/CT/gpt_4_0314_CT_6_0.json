So, the contrapositive of the given statement would be: If not Q (Bob did not choose pasta), then not P (Sue did not choose pizza).\n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive with the statement we want to infer:\nIf Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAs we can see, the contrapositive of the given statement is exactly the same as the statement we want to infer. Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the desired statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
