So, the contrapositive of P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be: If Erin did not take a train (\u00acQ), then Sam did not take a plane (\u00acP).\n\nNow, we can see that the contrapositive matches the statement we want to infer. Therefore, we can infer the contrapositive from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
