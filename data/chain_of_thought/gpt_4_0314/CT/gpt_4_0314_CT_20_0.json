So, the contrapositive of A \u2192 B is \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be: If the banana was not yellow (\u00acB), then the apple was not red (\u00acA).\n\nSo, based on the contrapositive, we can infer that if the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
