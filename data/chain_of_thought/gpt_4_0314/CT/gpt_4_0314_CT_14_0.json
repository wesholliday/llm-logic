            "content": "Let's analyze the given statement and its contrapositive.\n\nGiven statement: If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\nSymbolically, let B represent \"the bear was in the cave\" and W represent \"the wolf was in the den.\" The given statement can be written as: If B, then W or B \u2192 W.\n\nNow, let's find the contrapositive of the given statement. The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then reversing their order. So, the contrapositive of B \u2192 W is \u00acW \u2192 \u00acB, which means \"If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the given statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
