Either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the notebook is on the nightstand, or it is in the drawer. One of these must be true.\n\n2. The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\nThis statement suggests that there is a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand. However, it does not confirm that the notebook is definitely not on the nightstand.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: Can we infer 'The notebook is in the drawer'?\n\nSince the second statement only suggests a possibility and does not confirm that the notebook is not on the nightstand, we cannot definitively infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: no",
