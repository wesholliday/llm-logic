One of these must be true.\n\n2. \"The book might not be resting on the table\" - This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. However, it does not confirm that the book is definitely not on the table.\n\nNow, let's try to infer if \"The book is on the shelf\" based on these statements:\n\nSince the first statement presents two possibilities, and the second statement only suggests that the book might not be on the table (but does not confirm it), we cannot definitively conclude that the book is on the shelf. There is still a possibility that the book is on the table.\n\nAnswer: no",
