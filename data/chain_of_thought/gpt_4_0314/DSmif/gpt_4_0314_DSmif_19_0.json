One of these must be true.\n\n2. \"The watch might not be on his wrist\" - This statement tells us that there is a possibility that the watch is not on his wrist. However, it does not confirm that the watch is definitely not on his wrist.\n\nNow, let's try to infer if \"The watch is charging on the dresser\" can be concluded from these statements.\n\nSince the first statement presents two possibilities, and the second statement only suggests that the watch might not be on his wrist (but does not confirm it), we cannot definitively conclude that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: no",
