The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n- The first statement presents two possibilities: the phone is ringing in the kitchen, or the phone is in the living room.\n- The second statement eliminates one of those possibilities: the phone is not ringing in the kitchen.\n\nSince the first statement presents an \"either/or\" scenario, and the second statement eliminates one of those options, we can infer that the remaining option must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
