One of these must be true.\n\n2. \"Fido might not be in the garden\" - This statement suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. It does not confirm that Fido is definitely not in the garden, but it introduces doubt about Fido's location in the garden.\n\nNow, let's try to infer if \"Fido is inside\" based on these statements.\n\nSince the first statement presents two possibilities, and the second statement introduces doubt about Fido being in the garden, we cannot definitively conclude that Fido is inside. There is still a possibility that Fido is in the garden, even though there is doubt.\n\nAnswer: no",
