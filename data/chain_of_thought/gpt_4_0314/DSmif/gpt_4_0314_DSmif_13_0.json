Either the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box.\nThis statement tells us that there are only two possible locations for the toy: the bookshelf or the toy box.\n\n2. The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\nThis statement tells us that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf. However, it does not confirm that the toy is definitely not on the bookshelf.\n\nNow, let's try to infer if the toy is in the toy box:\n\nSince the first statement gives us two possible locations for the toy, and the second statement only tells us that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf, we cannot definitively conclude that the toy is in the toy box. There is still a possibility that the toy is on the bookshelf.\n\nAnswer: no",
