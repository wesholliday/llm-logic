The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are two possibilities: the sunglasses are on her head or in her bag. Statement 2 tells us that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. However, it does not confirm that they are definitely not on her head.\n\nSince we do not have definite information that the sunglasses are not on her head, we cannot infer with certainty that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: no",
