Either the jacket must be hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the jacket is in the closet, or it is on the chair. It does not guarantee that one of these options is true, but it does tell us that these are the only two options.\n\n2. The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\nThis statement tells us that there is a possibility that the jacket is not in the closet. However, it does not confirm that the jacket is definitely not in the closet.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer 'The jacket is draped over the chair'?\n\nSince the second statement only tells us that there is a possibility that the jacket is not in the closet, but does not confirm it, we cannot definitively conclude that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: no",
