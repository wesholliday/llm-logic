We have a statement that presents two possibilities: \"Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer.\" This means that if one of these possibilities is false, the other must be true.\n\n2. We are given another piece of information: \"The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet.\" This means that the first possibility is false.\n\nSince we know that one of the two possibilities must be true, and we have confirmed that the first possibility is false, we can infer that the second possibility must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
