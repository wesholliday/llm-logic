This means that both conditions must be met for the quorple. The rephrased statement says that the quorple must be at snork gribble and in the wibble plonk, which also implies that both conditions must be met. Since both statements convey the same meaning, we can infer the rephrased statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
