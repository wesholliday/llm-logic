            "content": "Explanation: The original statement says \"The gronk must be on the flonk and it must zazzle a plimp flim.\" The \"it\" in the statement refers to the gronk. So, the statement is essentially saying that the gronk must be on the flonk and the gronk must zazzle a plimp flim. The proposed inference is \"The gronk must be on the flonk and zazzle a plimp flim,\" which is just a rephrasing of the original statement without the pronoun \"it.\" The meaning of both statements is the same, so we can infer the proposed statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
