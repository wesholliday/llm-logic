The proposed inference is \"The quork must be floob with crunk and plonk zibber flonk.\" This statement is combining the two requirements into one, but it still conveys the same meaning as the original statement. Both statements are saying that the quork needs to have these two characteristics.\n\nAnswer: yes",
