To infer that \"The blimp must be zooble frazzle wump,\" we would need to eliminate the possibility of the blimp being snork. However, the original statement does not provide any information to eliminate snork as a possibility. Therefore, we cannot infer that the blimp must be zooble frazzle wump based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
