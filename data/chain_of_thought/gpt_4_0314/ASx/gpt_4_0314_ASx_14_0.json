This is given.\n\nWe want to know if (A \u2227 C) \u2192 B is true.\n\nIf A is true and C is true (A \u2227 C), then A is still true. Since A is true, and we know that A \u2192 B, then B must also be true.\n\nSo, if (A \u2227 C) is true, then B is true, which means (A \u2227 C) \u2192 B is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
