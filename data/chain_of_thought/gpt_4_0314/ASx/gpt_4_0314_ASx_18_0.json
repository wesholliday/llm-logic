We know that if the zonk is twiddled (A), it will pluzzle (B).\n2. We want to know if the zonk is twiddled (A) and it is blorped (C), will it still pluzzle (B)?\n3. Since we know that if the zonk is twiddled (A), it will pluzzle (B), adding an additional condition (C) doesn't change the fact that the zonk is twiddled (A).\n4. Therefore, if the zonk is twiddled (A) and it is blorped (C), it will still pluzzle (B) because the condition for pluzzling (A) is still met.\n\nAnswer: yes",
