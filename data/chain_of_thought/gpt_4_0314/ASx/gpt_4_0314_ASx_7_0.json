We know that if the tizzer is on (A), then the goom is snurpled (B).\n2. We want to know if the tizzer is on (A) and the plink light is out (C), then the goom is snurpled (B).\n3. Since we know that if the tizzer is on (A), the goom is snurpled (B), it doesn't matter whether the plink light is out (C) or not. The goom will still be snurpled (B) as long as the tizzer is on (A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
