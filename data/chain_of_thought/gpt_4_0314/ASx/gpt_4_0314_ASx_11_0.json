We know that if A (zibble is zapped), then B (glorp will zoon) is true.\n2. We want to infer if (A and C) (zibble is zapped and quib is squinked), then B (glorp will zoon) is true.\n3. If A is true, then B is true, regardless of whether C (quib is squinked) is true or false.\n4. Therefore, if (A and C) is true, then B is still true, because A being true guarantees B being true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
