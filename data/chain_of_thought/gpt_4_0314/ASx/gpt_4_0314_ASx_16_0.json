We know that if the trankle is sploofed (A), then the zorple will quibble (B).\n2. We want to know if the trankle is sploofed (A) and the drib is flanked (C), will the zorple still quibble (B)?\n3. Since we know that if A happens, B will happen, it doesn't matter if C happens or not. The occurrence of B is solely dependent on the occurrence of A.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning:\n\nAnswer: yes",
