(A: snark was blimmed, B: it flooped)\n\nStatement to infer: If the snark was blimmed and sproinged, then it flooped.\nThis can be represented as: If (A and C), then B. (C: snark was sproinged)\n\nNow, let's think step by step:\n\n1. We know that if A is true, then B is true (from the given statement).\n2. In the statement to infer, we have A and C both being true.\n3. Since A is true in the statement to infer, we can apply the given statement's logic.\n4. Therefore, if A is true (which it is in the statement to infer), then B is true.\n\nSo, based on the given statement, we can infer the statement in question.\n\nAnswer: yes",
