In the statement we need to infer, we have an additional condition C (the splat dangles). However, the presence of C does not affect the relationship between A and B. If A is true (the klonk is fizzered), then B (the meeping will nurple) will still be true, regardless of whether C is true or false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
