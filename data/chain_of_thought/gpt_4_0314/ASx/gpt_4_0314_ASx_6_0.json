The inferred statement adds an additional condition (I am wearing plorks) to the given statement. However, the given statement does not mention any relationship between glurping, snarfs, and plorks. \n\nSince the given statement only tells us that glurping causes snarfs to be hurt, we can infer that even if an additional condition (I am wearing plorks) is present, glurping will still hurt the snarfs. The additional condition does not change the outcome of glurping.\n\nAnswer: yes",
