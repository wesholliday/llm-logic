The statement we need to infer adds an additional condition, C (the bloop is zorped). However, the truth of B (the skrizzle is plonked) is still dependent only on the truth of A (the glop is on the brink), regardless of whether C is true or not.\n\nSo, if A is true (the glop is on the brink) and C is true (the bloop is zorped), then B is still true (the skrizzle is plonked) because the truth of B depends only on A.\n\nAnswer: yes",
