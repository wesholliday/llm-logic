We know that if A happens, then B happens.\n2. In the statement to infer, we have A and C happening.\n3. Since A is happening in the statement to infer, we can apply the given statement's logic.\n4. Therefore, if A happens (which it does in the statement to infer), then B happens.\n\nSo, based on the given statement, we can infer the statement in question.\n\nAnswer: yes",
