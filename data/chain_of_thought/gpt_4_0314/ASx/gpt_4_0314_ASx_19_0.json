(A: krimp is in the zool, B: snarf will be glonked)\n\nStatement to infer: If the krimp is in the zool and the zool is zapped, then the snarf will be glonked.\nThis can be represented as: If (A and C), then B. (C: zool is zapped)\n\nNow, let's analyze the logic:\n\nIf A is true (krimp is in the zool), then B is true (snarf will be glonked) according to the given statement.\n\nIn the statement to infer, we have A and C (krimp is in the zool and the zool is zapped). Since A is true, we can still conclude that B is true (snarf will be glonked) based on the given statement. The additional condition C (zool is zapped) does not affect the relationship between A and B.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the statement: If the krimp is in the zool and the zool is zapped, then the snarf will be glonked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
