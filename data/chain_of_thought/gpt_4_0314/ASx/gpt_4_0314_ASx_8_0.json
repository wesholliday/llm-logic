The statement we want to infer adds an additional condition: the plink was misglommed (R). However, the given statement does not provide any information about the relationship between misglomming (R) and tizzling (Q).\n\nDespite this, we can still infer the statement because the given statement tells us that morphing (P) alone is sufficient for tizzling (Q) to occur. The additional condition of misglomming (R) does not change the fact that morphing (P) leads to tizzling (Q).\n\nAnswer: yes",
