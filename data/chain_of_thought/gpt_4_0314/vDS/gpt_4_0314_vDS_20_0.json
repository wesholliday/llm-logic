Second premise: The sunglasses aren't perched on her head (not B).\n3. Conclusion: The sunglasses are in her bag (A).\n\nThis form of argument is known as disjunctive syllogism, which states that if one of the two disjuncts (A or B) is false, then the other must be true. In this case, since the second premise states that B is false (the sunglasses aren't perched on her head), then A must be true (the sunglasses are in her bag).\n\nAnswer: yes",
