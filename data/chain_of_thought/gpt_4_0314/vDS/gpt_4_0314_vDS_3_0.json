Second premise: The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet.\n3. Conclusion: The keys are in the drawer.\n\nThis argument is an example of the disjunctive syllogism, which has the following form:\n\n1. Either A or B.\n2. Not B.\n3. Therefore, A.\n\nIn this case, A represents \"the keys are in the drawer\" and B represents \"the keys are dangling in the cabinet.\" Since the second premise states that B is false, the only remaining possibility is A, which is the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
