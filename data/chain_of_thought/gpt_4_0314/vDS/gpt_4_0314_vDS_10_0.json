This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n\n2. Second premise: The missing sock isn't under the bed. This is a negation of one of the statements in the disjunction.\n\n3. Conclusion: The missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nSince the first premise states that at least one of the two statements must be true, and the second premise negates one of those statements, the only remaining possibility is that the missing sock is in the laundry basket. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
