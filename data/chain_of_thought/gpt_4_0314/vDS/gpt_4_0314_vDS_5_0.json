Second premise: The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry.\n\nNow, we can use the process of elimination to determine the conclusion. Since the cookies aren't hidden in the pantry (according to the second premise), the only other option given in the first premise is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nConclusion: The cookies are in the jar.\n\nThis form of argument is known as disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid form of argument. In a disjunctive syllogism, if one of the disjuncts (options) is false, then the other disjunct must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
