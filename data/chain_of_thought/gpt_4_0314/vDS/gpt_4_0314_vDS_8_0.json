Second premise: The remote control isn't hiding under the couch (not B).\n3. Conclusion: The remote control is on the coffee table (A).\n\nThis form of argument is known as disjunctive syllogism. In this case, since we know that either A or B must be true, and we know that B is false, then A must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
