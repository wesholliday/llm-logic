This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n\n2. Second premise: The toy isn't sitting on the shelf. This is a negation of one of the statements in the disjunction.\n\n3. Conclusion: The toy is in the toy box.\n\nSince the first premise states that at least one of the two statements must be true, and the second premise negates one of those statements, the only remaining possibility is that the toy is in the toy box. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
