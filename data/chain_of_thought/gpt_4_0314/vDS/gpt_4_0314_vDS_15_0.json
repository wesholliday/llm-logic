Second premise: The shoes aren't lined up by the door.\n3. Conclusion: The shoes are in the closet.\n\nThis argument is an example of the disjunctive syllogism, which has the following form:\n\n1. Either A or B.\n2. Not B.\n3. Therefore, A.\n\nIn this case, A represents \"the shoes are in the closet\" and B represents \"the shoes are lined up by the door.\" Since the second premise states that B is false, the only remaining option is A, which is the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
