Second premise: The newspaper isn't sitting on the porch (not B).\n3. Conclusion: The newspaper is in the driveway (A).\n\nThis form of argument is known as disjunctive syllogism, which states that if one of the two disjuncts (A or B) is false, then the other must be true. In this case, since the second premise negates B (not B), the only remaining possibility is A.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
