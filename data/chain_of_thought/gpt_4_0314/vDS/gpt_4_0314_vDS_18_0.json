Second premise: The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand.\n\nNow, we can use the process of elimination. Since the notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand, the only other option given in the first premise is that it must be in the drawer.\n\nConclusion: The notebook is in the drawer.\n\nThis form of argument is known as disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid form of argument.
