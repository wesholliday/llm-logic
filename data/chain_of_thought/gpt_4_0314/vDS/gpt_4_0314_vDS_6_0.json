Second premise: The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen (not B).\n3. Conclusion: The phone is in the living room (A).\n\nThis form of argument is known as disjunctive syllogism, which states that if one of the two disjuncts (A or B) is false, then the other must be true. In this case, since the second premise negates B (not B), the only remaining possibility is A, which is the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
