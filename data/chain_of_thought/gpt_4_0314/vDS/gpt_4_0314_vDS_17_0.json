Second premise: The scarf isn't draped on the coat rack (not B).\n3. Conclusion: The scarf is stuffed in my backpack (A).\n\nThis form of argument is known as disjunctive syllogism. In this case, if one of the disjuncts (B) is false, then the other disjunct (A) must be true. Since the second premise states that the scarf isn't draped on the coat rack (not B), the only remaining option is that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack (A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
