Second premise: The book isn't resting on the table.\n3. Conclusion: The book is on the shelf.\n\nThis argument is an example of the disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid form of argument. In a disjunctive syllogism, if one of the disjuncts (options) is false, then the other disjunct must be true. In this case, since the book isn't resting on the table (second premise), the only remaining option is that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
