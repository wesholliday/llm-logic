            "content": "Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. First premise: Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden. This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements (Fido is inside, Fido is in the garden) must be true.\n\n2. Second premise: Fido is not in the garden. This is a negation of one of the statements in the disjunction.\n\n3. Conclusion: Fido is inside. \n\nNow, let's check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises:\n\nSince the first premise states that either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden, and the second premise states that Fido is not in the garden, the only remaining possibility is that Fido is inside. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
