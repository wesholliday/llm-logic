Second premise: The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor (not B).\n3. Conclusion: The missing puzzle piece is in the box (A).\n\nThis form of argument is known as disjunctive syllogism, which states that if one of the two disjuncts (A or B) is false, then the other must be true. In this case, since the second premise states that B is false (not B), the conclusion must be that A is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
