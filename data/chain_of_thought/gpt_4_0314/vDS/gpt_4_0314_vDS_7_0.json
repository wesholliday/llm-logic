Second premise: The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet (not B).\n3. Conclusion: The umbrella is in the car (A).\n\nThis form of argument is known as disjunctive syllogism. In this case, if one of the disjuncts (B) is false, then the other disjunct (A) must be true. Since the second premise states that the umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet (not B), the only remaining option is that the umbrella is in the car (A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
