Second premise: The watch isn't on his wrist (not B).\n3. Conclusion: The watch is charging on the dresser (A).\n\nThis form of argument is known as disjunctive syllogism, which states that if one of the two disjuncts (A or B) is false, then the other must be true. In this case, since the watch isn't on his wrist (not B), the only remaining option is that the watch is charging on the dresser (A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
