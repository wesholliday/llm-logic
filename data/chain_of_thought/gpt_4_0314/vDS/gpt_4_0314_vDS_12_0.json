Second premise: The jacket isn't hanging in the closet (not B).\n3. Conclusion: The jacket is draped over the chair (A).\n\nThis form of argument is known as disjunctive syllogism. In this case, since we know that either A or B is true, and we also know that B is false, we can conclude that A must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
