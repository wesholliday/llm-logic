This is an \"inclusive or\" statement, meaning that at least one of the options (A or B) must be true.\n2. Second premise: The pen isn't on my desk (not B).\n3. Conclusion: The pen is in my bag (A).\n\nSince the first premise states that at least one of the options (A or B) must be true, and the second premise negates one of the options (not B), the only remaining possibility is that the pen is in the bag (A). Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
