(Not Q)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza (Not P).\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite the first statement as:\n\n1. If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza. (If not Q, then not P)\n\nSince we know that Bob did not choose pasta (Not Q), we can now infer that Sue did not choose pizza (Not P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
