Kate did not eat the salad.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\nIf statement 1 is true, then whenever Ben ate pasta, Kate must have eaten the salad. However, statement 2 tells us that Kate did not eat the salad. Since Kate did not eat the salad, and statement 1 tells us that if Ben ate pasta, Kate would have eaten the salad, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
