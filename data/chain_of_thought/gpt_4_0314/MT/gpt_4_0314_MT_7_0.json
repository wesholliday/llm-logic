Chris did not finish the race.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\nIf we assume that Alex finished the race, then according to statement 1, Chris must have finished the race as well. However, statement 2 tells us that Chris did not finish the race. This means that our initial assumption (that Alex finished the race) must be incorrect, because it leads to a contradiction with the given information.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
