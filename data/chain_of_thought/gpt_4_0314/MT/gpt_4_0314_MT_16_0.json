The pants were not denim.\n\nNow, let's think step by step:\n\nIf the shirt was cotton, then according to statement 1, the pants would be denim. However, statement 2 tells us that the pants were not denim. This means that the initial condition (the shirt being cotton) must be false, because if it were true, it would lead to a contradiction with statement 2.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
