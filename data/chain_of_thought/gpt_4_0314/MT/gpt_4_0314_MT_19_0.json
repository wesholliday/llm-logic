Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\nIf statement 1 is true, then whenever Tom watches football, Jen watches basketball. Since statement 2 tells us that Jen did not watch basketball, we can infer that the condition for statement 1 to be true did not occur. In other words, Tom did not watch football, because if he did, then Jen would have watched basketball, which contradicts statement 2.\n\nAnswer: yes",
