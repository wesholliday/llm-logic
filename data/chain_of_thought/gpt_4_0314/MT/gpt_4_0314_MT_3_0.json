The book is not a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's think step by step:\n\nIf the book was written by James, it would be a mystery novel according to statement 1. However, statement 2 tells us that the book is not a mystery novel. This means that the condition in statement 1 (the book being written by James) cannot be true, because if it were true, the book would be a mystery novel, which contradicts statement 2.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
