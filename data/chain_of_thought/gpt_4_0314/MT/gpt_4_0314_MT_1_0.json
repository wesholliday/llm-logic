Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's think step by step:\n\nIf statement 1 is true, then whenever Mary is at the wedding, Sue must also be at the wedding. However, statement 2 tells us that Sue was not at the wedding. Since Sue was not at the wedding, and Mary being at the wedding implies that Sue must be there, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
