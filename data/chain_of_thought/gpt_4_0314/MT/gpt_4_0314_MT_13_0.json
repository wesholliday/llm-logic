(Not B)\n\nNow, we want to infer if the car was not red (Not A).\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 1 as:\n\n1. If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red. (If not B, then not A)\n\nSince statement 2 says the truck was not blue (Not B), we can now infer from statement 1 that the car was not red (Not A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
