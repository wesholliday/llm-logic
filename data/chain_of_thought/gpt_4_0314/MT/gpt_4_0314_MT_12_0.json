Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\nIf we assume that Joe went to the park, then according to the first statement, Lucy must have gone to the zoo. However, we know from the second statement that Lucy did not go to the zoo. This means that our initial assumption that Joe went to the park must be incorrect.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
