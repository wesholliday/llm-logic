Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\nIf the first statement is true, then whenever Lisa buys the red shirt, Mark must buy the blue shirt. However, we know from the second statement that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This means that the condition for the first statement to be true (Lisa buying the red shirt) cannot be true, because if it were, Mark would have bought the blue shirt, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
