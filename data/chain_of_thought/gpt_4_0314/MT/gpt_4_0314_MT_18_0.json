The truck was not metal.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (doll being plastic) is true, then the result (truck being metal) must also be true.\n2. The second statement tells us that the truck was not metal.\n\nSince the truck was not metal, the condition in the first statement (doll being plastic) cannot be true, because if it were true, then the truck would have to be metal according to the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
