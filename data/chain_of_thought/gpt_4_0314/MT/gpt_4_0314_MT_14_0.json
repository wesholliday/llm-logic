(Not W)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer that the bear was not in the cave (Not B).\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite the first statement as:\n\n1. If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave. (If Not W, then Not B)\n\nNow, we can see that both statements have the same condition (Not W):\n\n1. If Not W, then Not B\n2. Not W\n\nSince both conditions are the same, we can infer the conclusion of the first statement:\n\nAnswer: yes",
