If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A (apple is red), then B (banana is yellow).\n\n2. The banana was not yellow.\nThis statement negates the second part of the conditional statement, which can be represented as: not B (banana is not yellow).\n\nNow, we want to infer if the apple was not red (not A) based on these two statements.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, if we have a conditional statement (If A, then B) and we know that B is false (not B), we can infer that A must also be false (not A). This is called modus tollens.\n\nSo, based on the given statements and using modus tollens, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
