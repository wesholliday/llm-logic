If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\nThis statement can be represented as: If G, then U (where G represents the griffin being in the forest, and U represents the unicorn being in the forest).\n\n2. The unicorn was not in the forest.\nThis statement can be represented as: not U.\n\nNow, we want to infer if the griffin was not in the forest (not G) based on these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite the first statement as: If not U, then not G. This means that if the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nSince we know that the unicorn was not in the forest (not U), we can now infer that the griffin was not in the forest (not G) based on the contrapositive of the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
