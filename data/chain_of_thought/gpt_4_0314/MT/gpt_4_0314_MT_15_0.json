Erin did not take a train.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\nIf we know that Erin did not take a train, and the first statement tells us that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane. This is because if Sam had taken a plane, then Erin would have taken a train, which contradicts the information given in the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
