Amy did not play tennis.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\nIf statement 1 is true, then whenever Jeff plays basketball, Amy plays tennis. Since statement 2 tells us that Amy did not play tennis, we can infer that the condition for statement 1 to be true did not occur. In other words, Jeff playing basketball would have led to Amy playing tennis, but Amy did not play tennis, so Jeff must not have played basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
