If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\nThis statement can be represented as: A \u2192 R, where A represents the alien visiting Mars and R represents the robot visiting Jupiter.\n\n2. The robot did not visit Jupiter.\nThis statement can be represented as: \u00acR, where \u00acR represents the negation of R (i.e., the robot not visiting Jupiter).\n\nNow, we want to infer whether the alien did not visit Mars (\u00acA) from these two statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite the first statement (A \u2192 R) as: \u00acR \u2192 \u00acA. This means that if the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nSince we know that the robot did not visit Jupiter (\u00acR), we can now infer that the alien did not visit Mars (\u00acA) based on the contrapositive of the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
