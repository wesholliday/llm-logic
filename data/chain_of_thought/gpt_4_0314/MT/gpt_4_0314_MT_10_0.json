The cat was not outside.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the dog was inside) is true, then the second part (the cat was outside) must also be true.\n2. The second statement tells us that the cat was not outside.\n\nSince the cat was not outside, the second part of the conditional statement is false. In order for the conditional statement to be true, the first part (the dog was inside) must also be false. Therefore, we cannot infer that the dog was inside.\n\nAnswer: no",
