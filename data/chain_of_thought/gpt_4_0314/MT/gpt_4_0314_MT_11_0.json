The muffins were not blueberry.\n\nNow, let's think step by step:\n\nIf the cake was chocolate, then according to statement 1, the muffins must be blueberry. However, statement 2 tells us that the muffins were not blueberry. This means that the condition for the cake being chocolate is not met, as it would lead to a contradiction with statement 2.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
