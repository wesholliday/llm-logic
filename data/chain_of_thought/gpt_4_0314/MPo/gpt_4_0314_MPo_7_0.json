If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\nSince we know that Alex finished the race (from statement 1), we can apply the conditional statement (statement 2) which states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nSince the condition (Alex finishing the race) is true, we can infer that the result (Chris finishing the race) is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
