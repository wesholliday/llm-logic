If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure of these statements. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the car was red) is true, then the second part (the truck was blue) must also be true.\n\nSince the first statement confirms that the car was red, we can apply the conditional statement and conclude that the truck must be blue.\n\nAnswer: yes",
