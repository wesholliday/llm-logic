If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure of these statements. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the shirt was cotton) is true, then the second part (the pants were denim) must also be true.\n\nSince the first statement confirms that the shirt was indeed cotton, we can apply the conditional statement and conclude that the pants were denim.\n\nAnswer: yes",
