If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the wolf was in the den. Since we know that the bear was in the cave (statement 1) and that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den (statement 2), we can use these two pieces of information to make an inference.\n\nUsing the logical structure of \"if A, then B\" and knowing that A is true (the bear was in the cave), we can conclude that B must also be true (the wolf was in the den).\n\nAnswer: yes",
