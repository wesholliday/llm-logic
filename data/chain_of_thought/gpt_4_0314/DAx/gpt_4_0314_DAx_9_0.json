If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If P, then Q. Here, P represents \"the twonk was plinked\" and Q represents \"it was varnished.\"\n\n2. The twonk was not plinked.\nThis statement is the negation of P, which can be represented as: not P.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The twonk was not varnished' from these two statements. In other words, we want to know if not Q follows from the given statements.\n\nHowever, the given statements do not provide enough information to conclude that the twonk was not varnished. The first statement only tells us what happens if the twonk was plinked, but it does not tell us what happens if the twonk was not plinked. It is possible that the twonk was varnished even if it was not plinked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The twonk was not varnished' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
