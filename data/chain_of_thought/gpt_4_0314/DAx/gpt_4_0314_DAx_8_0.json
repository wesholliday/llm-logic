The sprocket was not cranked.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the sprocket was not daggled.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A (cranked), then B (daggled). The second statement tells us that A (cranked) is false.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer that B (daggled) is false just because A (cranked) is false. The conditional statement only tells us that if A is true, then B must be true. It does not tell us anything about the case when A is false.\n\nSo, we cannot infer that the sprocket was not daggled based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
