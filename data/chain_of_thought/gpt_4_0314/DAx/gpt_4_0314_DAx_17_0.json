If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated.\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A, then B. In this case, A is \"the flob was skizzled\" and B is \"the flob movated.\"\n\n2. The flob was not skizzled.\nThis statement is the negation of A, which can be represented as: not A.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"The flob was not movated\" (not B) from these two statements.\n\nThe given statements do not provide enough information to conclude that the flob was not movated (not B). The first statement only tells us what happens if the flob was skizzled (A), but it does not tell us what happens if the flob was not skizzled (not A). It is possible that the flob could still movate even if it was not skizzled.\n\nAnswer: no",
