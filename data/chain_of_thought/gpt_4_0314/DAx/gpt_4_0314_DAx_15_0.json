(Not A)\n\nWe are asked if we can infer that the dreb was not spened (Not B).\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can see that this is an example of denying the antecedent. Denying the antecedent is a logical fallacy, meaning that the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises. In this case, just because the dreb was not vroombed (Not A), we cannot conclude that the dreb was not spened (Not B).\n\nAnswer: no",
