The whiffle was not shanked.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure of these statements:\n\n1. If A, then B.\n2. Not A.\n\nWe are asked to infer if Not B is true.\n\nHowever, the given statements do not provide enough information to conclude that Not B is true. We only know that if A were true, then B would be true. But since A is not true, we cannot determine the truth value of B.\n\nAnswer: no",
