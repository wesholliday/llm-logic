(Not P)\n\nNow, we want to infer if 'The glip was not tragged' (Not Q) is true.\n\nThe given statements form a logical structure called Modus Tollens. In Modus Tollens, if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not Q,\" we can infer \"Not P.\" However, in this case, we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not P,\" which does not allow us to directly infer \"Not Q.\"\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The glip was not tragged' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
