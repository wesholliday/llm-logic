(Not A)\n\nWe are asked to infer if the wug did not bim the zoint (Not B).\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement (If A, then B). The second statement negates the antecedent (Not A). However, we cannot directly infer the negation of the consequent (Not B) from these statements. This is because the conditional statement only tells us what happens if the wug was flooped, not what happens if it wasn't.\n\nAnswer: no",
