The fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the fleeg being bluttered) is true, then the result (it surned) must also be true. However, the second statement tells us that the condition (the fleeg being bluttered) is false.\n\nIn this case, we cannot make a definitive conclusion about whether the fleeg surned or not, because the conditional statement only tells us what happens when the fleeg is bluttered. It does not provide any information about what happens when the fleeg is not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: no",
