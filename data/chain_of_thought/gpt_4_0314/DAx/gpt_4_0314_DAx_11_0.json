(Not A)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The flug was not zimmed' (Not B) from these statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement (If A, then B). The second statement tells us that A is false (Not A). However, we cannot directly infer anything about B (zimmed) from these statements. \n\nFor example, consider the following similar statements:\n\n1. If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\n2. It is not raining.\n\nFrom these statements, we cannot conclude that the ground is not wet, because there could be other reasons for the ground to be wet (e.g., someone spilled water).\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The flug was not zimmed'.\n\nAnswer: no",
