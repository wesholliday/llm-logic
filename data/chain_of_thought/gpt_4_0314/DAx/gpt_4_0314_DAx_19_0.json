If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A, then B. In this case, A is \"the smonk was vreebled\" and B is \"the smonk plagged.\"\n\n2. The smonk was not vreebled.\nThis statement is the negation of A, which can be represented as: not A.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"The smonk was not plagged\" (not B) from these two statements.\n\nThe given statements do not provide enough information to conclude that the smonk was not plagged (not B). We only know that if the smonk was vreebled (A), then it would have plagged (B). However, we are given that the smonk was not vreebled (not A), but this does not necessarily mean that the smonk was not plagged (not B). The smonk could still have plagged for some other reason.\n\nAnswer: no",
