The grommet was not sploffed.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\" or \"A \u2192 B\", where A is \"the grommet was sploffed\" and B is \"the grommet plopped the frink\".\n\nThe second statement tells us that A is false, or \u00acA.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \u00acB, or \"the grommet did not plop the frink\".\n\nIn a conditional statement, if A is false, we cannot make any definitive conclusions about B. This is because the conditional statement only tells us what happens when A is true. It does not provide any information about what happens when A is false.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot infer whether the grommet did or did not plop the frink.\n\nAnswer: no",
