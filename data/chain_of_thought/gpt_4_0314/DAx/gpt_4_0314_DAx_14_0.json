If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If P, then Q. In this case, P represents \"the clug was fleeked\" and Q represents \"the clug snugged.\"\n\n2. The clug was not fleeked.\nThis statement is the negation of P, which can be represented as: not P.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The clug was not snugged' from these two statements. In other words, we want to know if not P implies not Q.\n\nHowever, the given statements do not provide enough information to conclude that not P implies not Q. The first statement only tells us what happens if P is true, but it does not tell us what happens if P is false. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The clug was not snugged' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
