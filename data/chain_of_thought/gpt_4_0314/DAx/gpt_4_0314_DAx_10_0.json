(Not A)\n\nWe are asked to infer if the wug was not garpled (Not B).\n\nThe given statements form a logical structure called Modus Tollens. In Modus Tollens, if we have \"If A, then B\" and \"Not B\", we can infer \"Not A\". However, in this case, we have \"If A, then B\" and \"Not A\", which does not allow us to directly infer \"Not B\".\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the wug was not garpled based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
