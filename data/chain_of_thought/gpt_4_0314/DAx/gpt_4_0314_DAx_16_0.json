(Not A)\n\nWe are asked to infer if the sneg did not sprot the frink (Not B).\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite statement 1 as:\n\n1. If the sneg did not sprot the frink, then the sneg was not crampled. (If Not B, then Not A)\n\nNow, we can compare statement 1 with statement 2:\n\n1. If Not B, then Not A\n2. Not A\n\nFrom these statements, we cannot directly infer Not B. We only know that if Not B were true, then Not A would also be true. However, we do not have enough information to determine if Not B is true or false.\n\nAnswer: no",
