If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A, then B. In this case, A is \"the fribble was snurgled\" and B is \"the fribble crinked.\"\n\n2. The fribble was not snurgled.\nThis statement is the negation of A, which can be represented as: not A.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The fribble did not crink' from these statements. In other words, we want to know if we can infer not B.\n\nHowever, the given statements do not provide enough information to infer not B. The first statement only tells us what happens if A is true (i.e., if the fribble was snurgled). It does not tell us what happens if A is false (i.e., if the fribble was not snurgled). Therefore, we cannot infer whether or not the fribble crinked based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
