(Not P)\n\nWe are asked to infer if the shank was not nugged (Not Q).\n\nThe given statements form a logical structure called Modus Tollens. In Modus Tollens, if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not Q,\" we can infer \"Not P.\" However, in this case, we have \"Not P\" instead of \"Not Q,\" so we cannot directly apply Modus Tollens.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to infer \"Not Q\" (The shank was not nugged), the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no",
