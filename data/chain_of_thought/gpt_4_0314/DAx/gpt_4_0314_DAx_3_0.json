(Not A)\n\nWe are asked to infer if the splat did not quank (Not B).\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can see that the given statements form a pattern of \"If A, then B\" and \"Not A.\" This is known as denying the antecedent. In this case, we cannot draw a valid conclusion about whether or not the splat quanked (Not B).\n\nAnswer: no",
