However, it does not mention any other factors that could affect the lawn's condition.\n\nQuestion: Can we infer that if I fertilize the lawn and there is a drought, it will be lush and green?\nIn this question, we are asked to consider an additional factor - a drought. A drought typically means a lack of water, which is essential for the growth and health of a lawn. The given statement does not provide any information about how the lawn would be affected by a drought, even if it is fertilized.\n\nSince we do not have enough information about the impact of a drought on the lawn, we cannot infer that the lawn will be lush and green if it is fertilized during a drought.\n\nAnswer: no",
