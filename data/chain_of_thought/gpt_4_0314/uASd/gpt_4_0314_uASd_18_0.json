The question asks if we can infer that if I water the plants and there is no sunlight, they will grow.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that watering the plants is a necessary condition for their growth. However, we do not have any information about the role of sunlight in the growth of the plants.\n\nPlants typically need sunlight for photosynthesis, which is essential for their growth. Without sunlight, plants may not grow properly, even if they are watered. Since we do not have any information about the plants' ability to grow without sunlight, we cannot infer that if I water the plants and there is no sunlight, they will grow. \n\nAnswer: no",
