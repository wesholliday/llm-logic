This statement implies that changing the oil is a necessary condition for the car to run smoothly.\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer that if you change the oil and the transmission is shot, the car will run smoothly.\n\nNow, let's think step by step:\n\n- Changing the oil is a necessary condition for the car to run smoothly, but it may not be the only condition. There could be other factors that affect the car's performance, such as the transmission.\n\n- The question introduces a new piece of information: the transmission is shot. This implies that there is a problem with the transmission, which could potentially affect the car's performance.\n\n- Since the transmission is an important component of the car, it is reasonable to assume that a problem with the transmission could prevent the car from running smoothly, even if the oil is changed.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can conclude:\n\nAnswer: no",
