However, we are given a new piece of information: the bill is paid, but the check bounces.\n3. A bounced check means that the payment was not successful due to insufficient funds or other issues with the payer's account.\n4. Since the check bounced, the bill is not actually paid, even though an attempt was made.\n5. Going back to the initial statement, we can only guarantee that the services will continue if the bill is paid.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we cannot infer that the services will continue if the bill is paid and the check bounces.\n\nAnswer: no",
