The package has shipped and it was misrouted.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that the package will arrive today, given that it was misrouted.\n\nThe initial statement only tells us that if the package has shipped, it will arrive today. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the package is misrouted. Since we don't have any information about the effect of misrouting on the package's arrival, we cannot infer that the package will arrive today.\n\nAnswer: no",
