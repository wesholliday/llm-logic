We know that placing an order guarantees that the item will ship. However, the question introduces a new condition - the item being out of stock. The given statement does not provide any information about what happens when an item is out of stock. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the order is placed and the item is out of stock, then it will ship, based on the given statement alone. \n\nAnswer: no",
