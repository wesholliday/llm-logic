We are asked to infer if the following statement is true: \"If the car is in the garage and the garage is flooding, then it is safe.\"\n\nNow, the given statement only tells us about the safety of the car when it is in the garage. It does not provide any information about the safety of the car when the garage is flooding. Flooding could potentially damage the car or make it unsafe.\n\nSince we do not have enough information to determine the safety of the car when the garage is flooding, we cannot infer that the car is safe in this situation.\n\nAnswer: no",
