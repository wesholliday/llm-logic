(B)\n\nWe are asked to infer if the wug was flooped (A).\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if A is true, then B must be true. However, it does not guarantee that if B is true, then A must be true. In other words, we cannot infer the wug was flooped just because the wug bimmed the zoint.\n\nAnswer: no",
