The fleeg surned (B)\n\nWe are asked to infer if the fleeg was bluttered (A).\n\nHowever, we cannot infer this from the given statements. The first statement tells us that if the fleeg was bluttered, it would surn. The second statement tells us that the fleeg surned, but it does not tell us if it was because the fleeg was bluttered or for some other reason.\n\nIn other words, we know that if A happens, B will happen. We also know that B happened, but we don't know if A was the cause or if there was another cause for B happening.\n\nAnswer: no",
