(B)\n\nWe are asked to infer if the grommet was sploffed (A).\n\nHowever, we cannot infer that the grommet was sploffed (A) just because the grommet plopped the frink (B). This is because the given information only tells us that if A happens, then B happens. It does not tell us that B can only happen if A happens. There could be other reasons for B happening.\n\nAnswer: no",
