The wug was garpled.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the wug was sproinged) is true, then the second part (it was garpled) must also be true. However, this statement does not guarantee that if the wug was garpled, it must have been sproinged.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the wug was indeed garpled. But this information alone does not allow us to infer that the wug was sproinged, as there could be other reasons for the wug being garpled.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the wug was sproinged.\n\nAnswer: no",
