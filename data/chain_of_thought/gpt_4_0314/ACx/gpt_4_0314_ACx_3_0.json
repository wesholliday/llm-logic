The splat quanked.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the splat was morphed.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the splat was morphed) is true, then the second part (the splat quanked) must also be true. However, this does not mean that if the second part is true, the first part must also be true.\n\nIn other words, the fact that the splat quanked does not necessarily mean that the splat was morphed. There could be other reasons for the splat quanking that we are not aware of.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the splat was morphed.\n\nAnswer: no",
