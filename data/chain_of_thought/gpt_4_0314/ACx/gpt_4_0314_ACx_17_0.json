The flob movated.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the flob was skizzled based on these statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the flob was skizzled) is true, then the second part (the flob movated) must also be true. However, this does not mean that if the second part is true, the first part must also be true.\n\nIn other words, the flob movating could be a result of it being skizzled, but it could also be a result of some other cause. We do not have enough information to definitively conclude that the flob was skizzled just because it movated.\n\nAnswer: no",
