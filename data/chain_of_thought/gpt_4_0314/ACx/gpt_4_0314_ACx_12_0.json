(B)\n\nWe are asked to infer if 'The smip was shripped' (A) is true.\n\nThe given statements are in the form of a conditional statement (If A, then B) and its consequent (B). However, to infer the antecedent (A) from these statements, we would need the statements to be in the form of a converse (If B, then A). Since we don't have that information, we cannot infer that 'The smip was shripped' (A) is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
