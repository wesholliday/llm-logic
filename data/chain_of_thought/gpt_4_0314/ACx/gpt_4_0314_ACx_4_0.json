If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked: This statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the fribble was snurgled) is true, then the second part (the fribble crinked) must also be true.\n\n2. The fribble crinked: This statement tells us that the second part of the conditional statement is true.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that the fribble was snurgled based on this information. The conditional statement tells us that if the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked. However, it does not tell us that the fribble crinked ONLY because it was snurgled. There could be other reasons for the fribble to crinkle.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the fribble was snurgled just because the fribble crinked.\n\nAnswer: no",
