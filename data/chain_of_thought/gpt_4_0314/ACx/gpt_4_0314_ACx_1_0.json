(B)\n\nWe are asked to infer if the flugel was blimmed (A).\n\nHowever, the given statements do not provide enough information to make this inference. We know that if the flugel was blimmed, then it was zargled. But we don't know if the flugel being zargled necessarily means it was blimmed. There could be other reasons for the flugel to be zargled.\n\nSo, we cannot infer that the flugel was blimmed based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
