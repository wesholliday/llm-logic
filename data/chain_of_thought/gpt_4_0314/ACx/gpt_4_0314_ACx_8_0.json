(B)\n\nWe are asked to infer if the sprocket was cranked (A).\n\nThe given statements represent a conditional statement (If A, then B) and its consequent (B). However, we cannot infer the antecedent (A) just because the consequent (B) is true. This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nFor example, consider the following statements:\n\n1. If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\n2. The ground is wet.\n\nWe cannot infer that it is raining just because the ground is wet, as there could be other reasons for the ground being wet (e.g., someone spilled water).\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the sprocket was cranked.\n\nAnswer: no",
