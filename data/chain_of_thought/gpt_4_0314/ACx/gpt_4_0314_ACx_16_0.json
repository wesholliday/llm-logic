(B)\n\nWe are asked if we can infer that the sneg was crampled (A).\n\nIn this case, we have the conditional statement (If A, then B) and the consequent (B), but we do not have the antecedent (A). We cannot directly infer the antecedent from the consequent. This is because there could be other reasons for the sneg sproted the frink, not just because it was crampled.\n\nAnswer: no",
