The dreb was spened (B)\n\nWe are asked to infer if the dreb was vroombed (A).\n\nHowever, the given information only tells us that if A happens, then B happens. It does not tell us that if B happens, then A must happen. This is a common logical fallacy called \"affirming the consequent.\"\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the dreb was vroombed.\n\nAnswer: no",
