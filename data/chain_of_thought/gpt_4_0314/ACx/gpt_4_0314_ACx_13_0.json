The glip was tragged (B)\n\nWe are asked to infer if the glip was slogged (A).\n\nThe given statements are in the form of a conditional statement (If A, then B) and its consequent (B). However, to infer the antecedent (A) from these statements, we would need the form of a converse statement (If B, then A). But we don't have that information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the glip was slogged from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
