(This is a statement: A)\n\nNow, we can use the Modus Ponens rule of inference, which states that if we have a conditional statement (If A, then B) and we know that A is true, then we can infer that B is true.\n\nSince we have the conditional statement (1) and we know that A (The clug was fleeked) is true from statement (2), we can infer that B (The clug snugged) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
