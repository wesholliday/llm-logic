(P)\n\nNow, we can use the modus ponens rule of inference, which states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"P\", we can infer \"Q\".\n\nApplying modus ponens to the given information:\n\n1. If the twonk was plinked (P), then it was varnished (Q).\n2. The twonk was plinked (P).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that it was varnished (Q).\n\nAnswer: yes",
