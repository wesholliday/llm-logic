If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed: This is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the flug was blummed) is true, then the second part (the flug was zimmed) must also be true.\n\n2. The flug was blummed: This statement tells us that the first part of the conditional statement is true.\n\nNow, since the first part of the conditional statement is true (the flug was blummed), we can infer that the second part (the flug was zimmed) must also be true, according to the rules of conditional statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
