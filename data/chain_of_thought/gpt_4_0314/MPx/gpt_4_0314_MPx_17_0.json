If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated: This is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the flob was skizzled) is true, then the second part (the flob movated) must also be true.\n\n2. The flob was skizzled: This statement tells us that the first part of the conditional statement is true.\n\nNow, since the first part of the conditional statement is true (the flob was skizzled), we can infer that the second part (the flob movated) must also be true, according to the rules of conditional statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
