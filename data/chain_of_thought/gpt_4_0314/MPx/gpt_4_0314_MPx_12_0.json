We have a conditional statement: \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint.\" This can be represented as: If A, then B.\n\n2. We are given that \"The smip was shripped.\" This means A is true.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that \"The smip lupped the zoint\" (B) based on the given information.\n\nSince we know that A is true, and the conditional statement tells us that if A is true, then B must also be true, we can infer that \"The smip lupped the zoint\" (B) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
