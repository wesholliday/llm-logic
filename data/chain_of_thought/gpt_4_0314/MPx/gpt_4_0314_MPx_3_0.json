If A, then B.\n2. A.\n\nWe want to know if we can infer B (The splat quanked) from these statements.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically the modus ponens rule, if we have a conditional statement (If A, then B) and the antecedent (A) is true, then we can infer that the consequent (B) is also true.\n\nIn this case, we have the conditional statement (If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked) and the antecedent (The splat was morphed) is true. Therefore, we can infer that the consequent (The splat quanked) is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
