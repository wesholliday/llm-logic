The whiffle was shanked.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n- Statement 1 is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the whiffle was shanked) is true, then the result (the whiffle tinked) must also be true.\n- Statement 2 confirms that the condition (the whiffle was shanked) is true.\n\nSince the condition is true, we can infer that the result (the whiffle tinked) must also be true, based on the conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
