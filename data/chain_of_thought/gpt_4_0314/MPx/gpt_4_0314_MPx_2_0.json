(A)\n\nNow, we can use the modus ponens rule of inference, which states that if we have \"If A, then B\" and \"A\", we can infer \"B\".\n\nApplying modus ponens to the given information:\n\n1. If the wug was flooped (A), then the wug bimmed the zoint (B).\n2. The wug was flooped (A).\n\nTherefore, we can infer:\n\nAnswer: yes",
