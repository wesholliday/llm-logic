We have a conditional statement: \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\" This means that if the first part (the shank being plooked) is true, then the second part (the shank being nugged) must also be true.\n\n2. We are also given that \"The shank was plooked.\" This means that the first part of the conditional statement is true.\n\nSince the first part of the conditional statement is true (the shank was plooked), we can infer that the second part of the statement (the shank was nugged) must also be true, according to the rules of logic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
