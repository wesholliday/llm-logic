The sneg was crampled. (This is a statement: A)\n\nNow, we can use the Modus Ponens rule of inference, which states that if we have a conditional statement (If A, then B) and we know that A is true, then we can infer that B is true.\n\nIn this case, A is \"the sneg was crampled\" and B is \"the sneg sproted the frink\". Since we know that A is true (the sneg was crampled), we can infer that B is true (the sneg sproted the frink).\n\nAnswer: yes",
