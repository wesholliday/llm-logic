The grommet was sploffed. (This is a statement affirming A)\n\nNow, we can use the modus ponens rule of inference, which states that if we have a conditional statement (If A, then B) and we know that A is true, then we can infer that B is true.\n\nSince we have both the conditional statement and the affirmation of A, we can apply modus ponens and infer that 'The grommet plopped the frink'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
