(This is a statement saying A is true)\n\nNow, we can use the Modus Ponens rule of inference, which states that if we have a conditional statement (If A, then B) and we know A is true, then we can infer that B is true.\n\nSince we have the conditional statement (If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned) and we know that the fleeg was bluttered (A is true), we can infer that the fleeg surned (B is true).\n\nAnswer: yes",
