We have a conditional statement: \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\" This means that if the first part (the fribble was snurgled) is true, then the second part (the fribble crinked) must also be true.\n\n2. We are given that \"The fribble was snurgled.\" This means that the first part of the conditional statement is true.\n\nSince the first part of the conditional statement is true, and the statement tells us that if the first part is true, then the second part must also be true, we can infer that \"The fribble crinked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
