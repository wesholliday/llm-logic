The sprocket was cranked. (This is a statement of fact: A)\n\nNow, we can use the Modus Ponens rule of inference, which states that if we have a conditional statement (If A, then B) and we know that A is true, then we can infer that B is true.\n\nIn this case, we have the conditional statement (If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled) and we know that the sprocket was cranked (A is true). Therefore, we can infer that the sprocket was daggled (B is true).\n\nAnswer: yes",
