(A)\n\nNow, we can use the modus ponens rule of inference, which states that if we have \"If A, then B\" and \"A\", we can infer \"B\".\n\nApplying modus ponens to our given information:\n\n1. If the flugel was blimmed (A), then the flugel was zargled (B).\n2. The flugel was blimmed (A).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flugel was zargled (B).\n\nAnswer: yes",
