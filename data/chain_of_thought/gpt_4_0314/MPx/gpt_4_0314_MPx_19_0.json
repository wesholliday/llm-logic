(A)\n\nWe are asked to infer if the smonk plagged (B).\n\nUsing the Modus Ponens rule in logic, if we have a conditional statement (If A, then B) and the antecedent (A) is true, then we can infer that the consequent (B) is also true.\n\nSince we have both the conditional statement and the antecedent as true, we can infer the consequent.\n\nAnswer: yes",
