The glip was slogged (A)\n\nNow, we can use the modus ponens rule of inference, which states that if we have \"If A, then B\" and \"A\", we can infer \"B\".\n\nSince we have both \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\" and \"The glip was slogged\", we can infer \"The glip was tragged\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
