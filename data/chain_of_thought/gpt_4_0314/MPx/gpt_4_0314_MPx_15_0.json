If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened: This is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the dreb was vroombed) is true, then the second part (the dreb was spened) must also be true.\n\n2. The dreb was vroombed: This statement tells us that the first part of the conditional statement is true.\n\nNow, since the first part of the conditional statement (the dreb was vroombed) is true, we can infer that the second part (the dreb was spened) must also be true, according to the rules of conditional statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
