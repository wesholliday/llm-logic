This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A, then B (where A is \"the zinger was fraggled\" and B is \"the zinger was smoogled\").\n\n2. The zinger was fraggled. This statement tells us that A is true.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that the zinger was smoogled (B).\n\nSince we know that the conditional statement (If A, then B) is true and we also know that A is true, we can infer that B must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
