Either the flob is movated or it is skizzled.\n\nNow, let's use these statements to infer whether the flob is skizzled or not.\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that the flob is not movated, we can eliminate the possibility of the flob being movated from statement 2. This leaves us with the only remaining option in statement 2, which is that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
