Either the clug is snugged or it is fleeked.\n\nNow, let's use these statements to infer information about the clug:\n\nSince statement 1 tells us that the clug is not snugged, and statement 2 tells us that either the clug is snugged or it is fleeked, we can conclude that the clug must be fleeked because the only other option (snugged) has been ruled out by statement 1.\n\nAnswer: yes",
