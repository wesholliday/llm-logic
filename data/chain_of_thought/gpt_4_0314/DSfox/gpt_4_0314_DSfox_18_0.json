Either the shank is nugged or it is plooked.\n\nWe are asked if we can infer that \"The shank is plooked\" from these statements.\n\nSince statement 1 tells us that the shank is not nugged, and statement 2 tells us that either the shank is nugged or it is plooked, we can conclude that the shank must be plooked because the only other option (nugged) has been ruled out by statement 1.\n\nAnswer: yes",
