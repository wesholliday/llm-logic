Either the twonk is plinked or it is varnished.\n\nNow, let's use these statements to infer the conclusion.\n\nSince the first statement says that the twonk is not plinked, and the second statement says that either the twonk is plinked or it is varnished, we can conclude that the twonk must be varnished. This is because the second statement presents two possibilities, and the first statement eliminates one of those possibilities (the twonk being plinked).\n\nAnswer: yes",
