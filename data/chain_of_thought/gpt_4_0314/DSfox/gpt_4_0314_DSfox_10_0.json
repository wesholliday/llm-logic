Either the wug is garpled or it is sproinged.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nSince the first statement says that the wug is not garpled, and the second statement presents two options (either the wug is garpled or it is sproinged), we can eliminate the possibility of the wug being garpled based on the first statement.\n\nWith the garpled option eliminated, the only remaining option from the second statement is that the wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
