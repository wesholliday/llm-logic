Either the dreb is spened or it is vroombed.\n\nNow, let's use logical reasoning to infer the conclusion.\n\nSince the first statement says that the dreb is not spened, and the second statement presents two possibilities (either the dreb is spened or it is vroombed), we can eliminate the possibility of the dreb being spened based on the first statement.\n\nThis leaves us with only one possibility, which is that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
