Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nSince statement 1 says that the sprocket is not daggled, and statement 2 says that either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked, we can infer that the sprocket must be cranked because the first part of statement 2 (the sprocket is daggled) is false according to statement 1.\n\nAnswer: yes",
