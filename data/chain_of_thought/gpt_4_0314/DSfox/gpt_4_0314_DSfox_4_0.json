Either the fribble is crinked or it is snurgled.\n\nNow, let's use these statements to infer whether the fribble is snurgled or not.\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that the fribble is not crinked, we can eliminate the possibility of the fribble being crinked from statement 2. This leaves us with the only remaining option in statement 2, which is that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
