Either the zinger is smoogled or it is fraggled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nSince the first statement tells us that the zinger is not smoogled, and the second statement tells us that either the zinger is smoogled or it is fraggled, we can infer that the zinger must be fraggled because the first part of the second statement (the zinger is smoogled) is false according to the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
