(B)\n\nWe are asked if it follows that the alien visited Mars (A).\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement (If A, then B). It tells us that if the alien visited Mars, the robot must have visited Jupiter. However, it does not tell us that the alien visiting Mars is the only way for the robot to visit Jupiter.\n\nSince we know that the robot visited Jupiter (B), it is possible that the alien visited Mars (A), but it is also possible that the robot visited Jupiter for some other reason. The given information does not allow us to definitively conclude that the alien visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: no",
