Kate ate salad (This is a given fact)\n\nNow, we need to determine if 'Ben ate pasta' is true based on these statements.\n\nThe first statement tells us that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. However, it does not tell us what happens if Ben did not eat pasta. It is possible that Kate ate salad regardless of whether Ben ate pasta or not.\n\nSince we know that Kate ate salad, it does not necessarily mean that Ben ate pasta. There could be other reasons for Kate eating salad.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that 'Ben ate pasta' is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
