The unicorn was in the forest (U)\n\nWe are asked if it follows that the griffin was in the forest (G).\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement (If G, then U). It tells us that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must also be in the forest. However, it does not tell us anything about the griffin's presence if the unicorn is in the forest.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the unicorn was in the forest (U). But this information alone does not provide any direct information about the griffin's presence.\n\nSince we do not have enough information to conclude that the griffin was in the forest, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no",
