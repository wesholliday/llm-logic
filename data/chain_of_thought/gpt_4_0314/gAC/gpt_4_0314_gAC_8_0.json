The mummy was awake (M)\n\nWe are asked to determine if the vampire was awake (V).\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. However, this statement does not tell us what happens if the mummy is awake without the vampire being awake. It is possible that the mummy could be awake without the vampire being awake.\n\nSince we only know that the mummy was awake (statement 2), we cannot definitively conclude that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
