Erin took a train (Q)\n\nWe are asked to determine if Sam took a plane (P) is true.\n\nThe given statements are in the form of a conditional statement (If P, then Q). However, we are given the truth of Q (Erin took a train) and asked to determine the truth of P (Sam took a plane). This is the fallacy of affirming the consequent, which means that we cannot conclude the truth of P based on the truth of Q.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that Sam took a plane based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
