(B)\n\nWe are asked if it follows that the bear was in the cave (A).\n\nThe given statements form a logical implication (If A, then B). However, knowing that B is true does not necessarily mean that A is true. This is because there could be other reasons for B being true, not just A. In this case, the wolf being in the den does not guarantee that the bear was in the cave.\n\nAnswer: no",
