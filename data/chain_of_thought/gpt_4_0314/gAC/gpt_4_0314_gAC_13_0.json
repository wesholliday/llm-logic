(Q)\n\nWe are asked if it follows that the car was red (P).\n\nThe given statements are an example of the logical concept called \"affirming the consequent.\" Affirming the consequent is a logical fallacy because it assumes that if the consequent (Q) is true, then the antecedent (P) must also be true. However, this is not necessarily the case.\n\nFor example, there could be other reasons why the truck is blue, unrelated to the color of the car. The fact that the truck is blue does not guarantee that the car is red.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that the car was red.\n\nAnswer: no",
