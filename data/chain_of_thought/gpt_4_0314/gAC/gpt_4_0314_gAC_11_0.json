The muffins were blueberry.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the cake being chocolate) is true, then the second part (the muffins being blueberry) must also be true. However, this statement does not guarantee that the cake being chocolate is the only reason for the muffins being blueberry.\n\nThe second statement confirms that the muffins were indeed blueberry. But this information alone does not provide enough evidence to conclude that the cake was chocolate. There could be other reasons for the muffins being blueberry.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that the cake was chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no",
