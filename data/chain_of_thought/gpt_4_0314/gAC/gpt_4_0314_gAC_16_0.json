The pants were denim.\n\nWe are asked if it follows that the shirt was cotton.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A (shirt was cotton), then B (pants were denim). The second statement confirms that B (pants were denim) is true.\n\nHowever, knowing that B is true does not necessarily mean that A (shirt was cotton) is true. The conditional statement only tells us that if A is true, then B must be true. It does not tell us that if B is true, then A must be true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that the shirt was cotton based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
