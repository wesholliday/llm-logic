(B)\n\nWe are asked to determine if the apple was red (A).\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement (If A, then B). It tells us that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. However, it does not tell us what happens if the apple is not red.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the banana was yellow (B). But this information alone does not provide any direct information about the apple's color.\n\nSince we only know that the banana was yellow (B) and the conditional statement (If A, then B), we cannot definitively conclude that the apple was red (A). The apple could be red or not red, and the given information does not allow us to determine its color.\n\nAnswer: no",
