The book is a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure of these statements. The first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\n\nIf A (the book was written by James), then B (the book is a mystery novel).\n\nThe second statement is a simple assertion:\n\nB (the book is a mystery novel).\n\nFrom these statements, we cannot definitively conclude that A (the book was written by James) is true. We only know that if A is true, then B must be true. However, B being true does not necessarily mean that A is true. There could be other reasons for B being true, such as the book being written by a different author who also writes mystery novels.\n\nAnswer: no",
