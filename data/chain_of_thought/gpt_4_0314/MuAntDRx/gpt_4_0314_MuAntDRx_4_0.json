The question asks if we can infer that \"The blimple must be blimple.\" This would mean that we can conclude with certainty that the blimple is at blimple. However, since there is another possibility (zooble grazzle) mentioned in the original statement, we cannot definitively conclude that the blimple must be at blimple.\n\nAnswer: no",
