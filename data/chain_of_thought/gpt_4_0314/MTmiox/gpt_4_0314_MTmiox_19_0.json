It does not give us any definitive information about whether the smonk actually plagged or not.\n\n2. \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged\" - This statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the smonk was vreebled, then it definitely plagged.\n\nNow, let's try to infer whether \"The smonk was not vreebled\" from these statements.\n\nIf the smonk was vreebled, then it must have plagged, according to statement 2. However, statement 1 tells us that it is possible that the smonk did not plag. This means that it is possible that the smonk was not vreebled, because if it was vreebled, it would have definitely plagged.\n\nSince there is a possibility that the smonk did not plag, and if it was vreebled it must have plagged, we can infer that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
