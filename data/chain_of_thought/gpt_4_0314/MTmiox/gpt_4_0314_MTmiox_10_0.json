The wug might not have been garpled.\nThis statement tells us that there is a possibility that the wug was not garpled. It does not confirm whether the wug was garpled or not.\n\n2. If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled.\nThis statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the wug was sproinged, then it definitely was garpled.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"The wug was not sproinged\" from these statements.\n\nIf the wug was sproinged, then according to statement 2, it must have been garpled. However, statement 1 tells us that there is a possibility that the wug was not garpled. This means that there is a possibility that the wug was not sproinged. But this does not confirm that the wug was not sproinged.\n\nAnswer: no",
