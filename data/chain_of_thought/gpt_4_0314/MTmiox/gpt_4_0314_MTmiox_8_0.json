The sprocket might not have been daggled.\nThis statement tells us that there is a possibility that the sprocket was not daggled. It does not confirm whether the sprocket was daggled or not.\n\n2. If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled.\nThis statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the sprocket was cranked, then it definitely was daggled.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"The sprocket was not cranked\" from these two statements.\n\nSince the first statement only tells us that there is a possibility that the sprocket was not daggled, we cannot definitively conclude that the sprocket was not cranked. It is still possible that the sprocket was cranked and daggled, or not cranked and not daggled.\n\nAnswer: no",
