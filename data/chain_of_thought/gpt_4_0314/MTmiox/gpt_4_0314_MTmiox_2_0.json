If the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The wug was not flooped\" from these statements.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n- If the wug was flooped, then according to statement 2, the wug must have bimmed the zoint. This contradicts statement 1, which says the wug might not have bimmed the zoint.\n- If the wug was not flooped, then statement 2 doesn't apply, and there's no contradiction with statement 1.\n\nSince the only possibility that doesn't lead to a contradiction is that the wug was not flooped, we can infer that the wug was not flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
