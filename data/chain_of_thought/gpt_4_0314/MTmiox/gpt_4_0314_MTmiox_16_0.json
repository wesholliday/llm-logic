The sneg might not have sproted the frink.\nThis statement implies that there is a possibility that the sneg did not sprot the frink. It does not confirm whether the sneg sproted the frink or not.\n\n2. If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink.\nThis statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the sneg was crampled, then it definitely sproted the frink.\n\nNow, let's try to infer 'The sneg was not crampled' from these statements.\n\nIf we assume that the sneg was crampled, then according to statement 2, the sneg must have sproted the frink. However, statement 1 tells us that there is a possibility that the sneg did not sprot the frink. This means that we cannot be sure if the sneg was crampled or not, based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
