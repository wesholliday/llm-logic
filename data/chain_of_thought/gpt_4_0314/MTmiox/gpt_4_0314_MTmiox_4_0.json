However, it does not tell us for certain whether the fribble crinked or not.\n\n2. \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked\" - This statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the fribble was snurgled, then it definitely crinked.\n\nNow, let's try to infer whether \"The fribble was not snurgled\" from these statements.\n\nIf the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked (according to statement 2). However, statement 1 tells us that it is possible that the fribble did not crink. This means that it is possible that the fribble was not snurgled. But since statement 1 does not give us certainty about the fribble's crinking status, we cannot definitively conclude that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nAnswer: no",
