It does not confirm whether the splat quanked or not.\n\n2. \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked\" - This statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the splat was morphed, then it definitely quanked.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"The splat was not morphed\" from these two statements.\n\nIf the splat was morphed, then according to statement 2, it must have quanked. However, statement 1 tells us that there is a possibility that the splat did not quank. This means that there is a possibility that the splat was not morphed. But it does not confirm that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: no",
