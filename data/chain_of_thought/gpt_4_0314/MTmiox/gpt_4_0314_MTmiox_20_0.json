It does not give us any definitive information about whether the fleeg was surned or not.\n\n2. \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned\" - This statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it definitely was surned.\n\nNow, let's try to infer whether \"The fleeg was not bluttered\" from these statements.\n\nIf the fleeg was bluttered, then according to statement 2, it must have been surned. However, statement 1 tells us that it is possible that the fleeg was not surned. This means that there is a possibility that the fleeg was not bluttered, but it does not definitively tell us that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: no",
