The flugel might not have been zargled.\nThis statement tells us that there is a possibility that the flugel was not zargled. It does not confirm whether the flugel was zargled or not.\n\n2. If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled.\nThis statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the flugel was blimmed, then it must have been zargled. However, it does not provide any information about whether the flugel was actually blimmed or not.\n\nNow, let's try to infer whether the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nIf we assume that the flugel was blimmed, then according to the second statement, it must have been zargled. However, this would contradict the first statement, which says that the flugel might not have been zargled. Therefore, we can conclude that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
