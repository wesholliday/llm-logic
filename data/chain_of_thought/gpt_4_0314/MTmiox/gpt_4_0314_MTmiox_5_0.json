If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger must have been smoogled.\n\nNow, let's think step by step:\n\nIf the zinger was fraggled, then according to statement 2, it must have been smoogled. However, statement 1 tells us that it's possible that the zinger was not smoogled. This means that it's possible that the zinger was not fraggled, because if it was fraggled, it would have to be smoogled, which contradicts statement 1.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
