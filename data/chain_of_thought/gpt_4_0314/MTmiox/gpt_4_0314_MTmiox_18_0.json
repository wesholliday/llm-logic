It does not confirm whether the shank was nugged or not.\n\n2. \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged\" - This statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the shank was plooked, then it definitely was nugged.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"The shank was not plooked\" from these statements.\n\nSince the first statement only tells us that it is possible that the shank was not nugged, we cannot definitively conclude that the shank was not plooked. It is still possible that the shank was plooked and, as a result, was nugged.\n\nAnswer: no",
