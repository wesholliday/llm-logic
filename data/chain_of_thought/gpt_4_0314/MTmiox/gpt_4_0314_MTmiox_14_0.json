It does not confirm whether the clug was snugged or not.\n\n2. \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged\" - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the clug was fleeked, then it definitely was snugged.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"The clug was not fleeked\" from these two statements.\n\nSince the first statement only tells us that there is a possibility that the clug was not snugged, we cannot definitively conclude that the clug was not fleeked. It is still possible that the clug was fleeked and snugged, or not fleeked and not snugged.\n\nAnswer: no",
