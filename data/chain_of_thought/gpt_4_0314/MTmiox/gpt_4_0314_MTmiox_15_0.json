It does not give us any definitive information about whether the dreb was spened or not.\n\n2. \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened\" - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the dreb was vroombed, then it definitely was spened.\n\nNow, let's try to infer if \"The dreb was not vroombed\" from these statements.\n\nIf the dreb was vroombed, then according to statement 2, it must have been spened. However, statement 1 tells us that it is possible that the dreb was not spened. This means that there is a possibility that the dreb was not vroombed, because if it was vroombed, it would have to be spened.\n\nAnswer: yes",
