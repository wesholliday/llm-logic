It does not confirm whether the flob movated or not.\n\n2. \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated\" - This statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the flob was skizzled, then it definitely movated.\n\nNow, let's try to infer \"The flob was not skizzled\" from these statements.\n\nIf the flob was skizzled, then according to statement 2, it must have movated. However, statement 1 tells us that there is a possibility that the flob did not movate. This means that there is a possibility that the flob was not skizzled. But it does not confirm that the flob was definitely not skizzled.\n\nAnswer: no",
