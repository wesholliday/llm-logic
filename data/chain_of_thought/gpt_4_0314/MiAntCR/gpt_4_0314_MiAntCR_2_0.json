It does not provide any information about the location of the book. However, the second statement combines the possibility of the book having a red cover with the possibility of it being on the shelf. Since the original statement does not contradict or exclude the possibility of the book being on the shelf, we can infer that the book might be on the shelf and have a red cover.\n\nAnswer: yes",
