This means that there are two separate possibilities: one where the concert is cancelled, and another where the concert is rescheduled. The question asks if we can infer that the concert might be cancelled and rescheduled, which would mean that both events happen simultaneously. However, the original statement does not provide enough information to conclude that both events can happen at the same time.\n\nAnswer: no",
