However, these two possibilities are not necessarily connected. It is possible that the cat is in the garden but not sleeping, or that the cat is sleeping but not in the garden. To infer that \"The cat might be sleeping in the garden,\" we would need information that connects these two possibilities, such as \"The cat might be in the garden while sleeping.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
