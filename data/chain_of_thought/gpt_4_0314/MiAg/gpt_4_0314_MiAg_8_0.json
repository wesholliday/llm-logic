This means that there is a possibility that the restaurant is expensive, and there is also a possibility that the restaurant is busy. However, it does not explicitly state that both conditions can occur simultaneously. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the restaurant might be expensive and busy at the same time.\n\nAnswer: no",
