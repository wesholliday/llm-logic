However, it does not explicitly state that these two possibilities are occurring simultaneously. It is possible that the package could be delivered today without being damaged, or it could be damaged but not delivered today. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the package might be delivered damaged today based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
