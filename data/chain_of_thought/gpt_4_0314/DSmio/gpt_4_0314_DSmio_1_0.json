Fido might not be in the garden.\nThis statement implies that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it doesn't confirm that Fido is definitely not in the garden.\n\n2. Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\nThis statement is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two options must be true: Fido is either inside or in the garden.\n\nNow, let's try to infer if Fido is inside:\n\nSince the first statement only suggests a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, we cannot be certain that Fido is not in the garden. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Fido is inside based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
