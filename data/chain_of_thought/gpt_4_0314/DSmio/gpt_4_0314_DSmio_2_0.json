Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\n\nStatement 1 implies that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. Statement 2 presents two options: the book is either on the shelf or on the table.\n\nSince there is a possibility that the book is not on the table (according to statement 1), and statement 2 tells us that if it's not on the table, it must be on the shelf, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
