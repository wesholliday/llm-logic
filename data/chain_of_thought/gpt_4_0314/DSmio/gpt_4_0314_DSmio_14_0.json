The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\nThis statement implies that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge, but it doesn't confirm that it is not in the fridge.\n\n2. Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the milk is on the counter, or it is chilling in the fridge.\n\nNow, let's try to infer if the milk is on the counter:\n\nSince the first statement only suggests a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge, it doesn't provide enough information to confirm that the milk is on the counter. The second statement presents two possibilities, but we cannot definitively conclude that the milk is on the counter based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
