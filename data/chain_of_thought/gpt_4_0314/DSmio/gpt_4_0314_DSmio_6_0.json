Either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the phone is in the living room.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there is a possibility that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen. However, this statement does not provide any certainty about the phone's location or its ringing status.\n\nStatement 2 presents two possibilities: the phone is in the living room, or it is ringing in the kitchen. Since statement 1 suggests that the phone might not be ringing in the kitchen, we can consider the alternative possibility presented in statement 2, which is that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes",
