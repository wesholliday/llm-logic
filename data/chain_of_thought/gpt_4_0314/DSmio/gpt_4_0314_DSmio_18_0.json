Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that there are only two possibilities: the notebook is either in the drawer or on the nightstand. Since statement 1 tells us that the notebook might not be on the nightstand, we can infer that the only remaining possibility is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
