Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk.\n\nStatement 1 suggests that there is a possibility that the pen is not on the desk. Statement 2 presents two options: the pen is either in the bag or on the desk.\n\nSince statement 1 indicates that the pen might not be on the desk, and statement 2 provides only two possible locations for the pen (in the bag or on the desk), we can infer that if the pen is not on the desk, it must be in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
