Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 suggests that there is a possibility that the watch is not on his wrist. It does not confirm that the watch is definitely not on his wrist.\n\nStatement 2 presents two possibilities: the watch is either charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist.\n\nTo infer that \"The watch is charging on the dresser,\" we would need to confirm that the watch is definitely not on his wrist. However, statement 1 only suggests that it might not be on his wrist, not that it definitely isn't. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: no",
