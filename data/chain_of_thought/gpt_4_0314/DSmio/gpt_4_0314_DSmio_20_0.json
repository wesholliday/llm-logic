Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head. Statement 2 presents two options: the sunglasses are either in her bag or on her head.\n\nSince there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head (from statement 1), and statement 2 tells us that if they are not on her head, they must be in her bag, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
