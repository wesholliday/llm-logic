The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack.\nThis statement implies that there is a possibility that the scarf is not on the coat rack.\n\n2. Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the scarf is in the backpack or it is on the coat rack.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\nSince there is a possibility that the scarf is not on the coat rack (from statement 1), and we know that it must be either in the backpack or on the coat rack (from statement 2), we can infer that if it's not on the coat rack, it must be in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
