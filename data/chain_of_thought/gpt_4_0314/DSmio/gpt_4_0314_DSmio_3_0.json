Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that there are two possibilities: the keys are in the drawer, or they are dangling in the cabinet. Statement 1 tells us that there is a possibility that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet. However, it does not confirm that the keys are definitely not in the cabinet.\n\nSince we do not have definite information that the keys are not in the cabinet, we cannot be certain that the keys are in the drawer. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The keys are in the drawer\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
