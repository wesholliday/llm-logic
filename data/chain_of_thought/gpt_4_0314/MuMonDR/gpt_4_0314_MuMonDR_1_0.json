The new statement we want to infer is \"The envelope must be upstairs or under a bed.\" This statement presents two possibilities: the envelope is either upstairs or under a bed. Since the original statement already confirms that the envelope is under a bed, it also satisfies the condition of the new statement, as the envelope being under a bed is one of the possibilities presented.\n\nAnswer: yes",
