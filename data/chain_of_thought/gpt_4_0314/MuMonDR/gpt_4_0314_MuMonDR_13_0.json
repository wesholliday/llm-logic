The question asks if we can infer \"The movie must have been subtitled or in English\" from the given statement. Since the movie was in English, it already satisfies the condition of being \"in English\" in the new statement. It doesn't matter whether the movie was subtitled or not, as the \"or\" condition allows for either one or both of the conditions to be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
