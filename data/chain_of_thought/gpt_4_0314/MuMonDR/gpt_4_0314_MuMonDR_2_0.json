Now, we are asked if we can infer \"The book must be in the library or on the shelf\" from the given statement. The new statement presents two possibilities: the book is either in the library or on the shelf. Since the given statement already confirms that the book is on the shelf, it also satisfies the condition of the new statement, which allows for the book to be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
