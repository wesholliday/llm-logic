The alternative statement, \"The project must have been extended or completed by Friday,\" suggests two possibilities: either the project was completed by Friday or its deadline was extended beyond Friday. Since the original statement is included as one of the possibilities in the alternative statement, we can infer the alternative statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
