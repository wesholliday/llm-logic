The statement we want to infer is \"The keys must be on the table or in the drawer.\" This statement allows for the possibility that the keys are either on the table or in the drawer. Since the original statement confirms that the keys are in the drawer, it is also true that the keys are either on the table or in the drawer, because one of the conditions (keys being in the drawer) is already satisfied.\n\nAnswer: yes",
