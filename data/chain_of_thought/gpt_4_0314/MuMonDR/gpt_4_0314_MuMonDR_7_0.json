The question asks if we can infer \"The exam must have been easy or difficult\" from the given statement. In logic, the word \"or\" is inclusive, meaning that if one of the conditions is true, then the entire statement is true. Since the given statement already asserts that the exam was difficult, the statement \"The exam must have been easy or difficult\" is also true because one of the conditions (the exam being difficult) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
