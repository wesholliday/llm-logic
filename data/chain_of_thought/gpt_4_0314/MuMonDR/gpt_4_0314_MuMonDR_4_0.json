The statement we want to infer is \"The meeting must have been cancelled or scheduled for 2 PM.\" Since the meeting is already scheduled for 2 PM, it satisfies the second part of the inferred statement (scheduled for 2 PM). Therefore, we can infer the statement because one of the conditions (scheduled for 2 PM) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
