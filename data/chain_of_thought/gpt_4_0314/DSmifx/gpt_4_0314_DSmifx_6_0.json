Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed.\nThis statement tells us that there are two possibilities: the grommet is plopped or the grommet is sploffed. One of these must be true.\n\n2. The grommet might not be plopped.\nThis statement tells us that there is a possibility that the grommet is not plopped. However, it does not guarantee that the grommet is not plopped.\n\nNow, let's try to infer if the grommet is sploffed.\n\nSince the first statement tells us that one of the two possibilities must be true, and the second statement only tells us that there is a possibility that the grommet is not plopped, we cannot definitively conclude that the grommet is sploffed. There is still a possibility that the grommet is plopped.\n\nAnswer: no",
