Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered: This statement is a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions (fleeg being surned or fleeg being bluttered) must be true.\n\n2. The fleeg might not be surned: This statement implies that there is a possibility that the fleeg is not surned, but it does not confirm that the fleeg is definitely not surned.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: Can we infer 'The fleeg is bluttered'?\n\nSince the second statement does not confirm that the fleeg is definitely not surned, we cannot definitively conclude that the fleeg is bluttered. There is still a possibility that the fleeg is surned.\n\nAnswer: no",
