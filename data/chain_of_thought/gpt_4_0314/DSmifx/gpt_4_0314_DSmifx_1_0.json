The flugel might not be zargled.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are two possibilities: the flugel is zargled or the flugel is blimmed. Statement 2 tells us that there is a possibility that the flugel is not zargled. However, it does not confirm that the flugel is definitely not zargled.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to confirm that the flugel is not zargled, we cannot definitively infer that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: no",
