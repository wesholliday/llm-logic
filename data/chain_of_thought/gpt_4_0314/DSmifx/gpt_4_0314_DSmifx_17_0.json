One of these must be true.\n\n2. \"The flob might not be movated\" - This statement tells us that there is a possibility that the flob is not movated. However, it does not confirm that the flob is definitely not movated.\n\nNow, let's try to infer if \"The flob is skizzled\" based on these statements.\n\nSince the first statement presents two possibilities, and the second statement only tells us that there is a possibility that the flob is not movated, we cannot definitively conclude that the flob is skizzled. There is still a chance that the flob is movated, even though it might not be.\n\nAnswer: no",
