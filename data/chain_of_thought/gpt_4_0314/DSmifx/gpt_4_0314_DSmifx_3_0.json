If one of these possibilities is true, then the statement is true.\n\n2. \"The splat might not be quanked\" - This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the splat is not quanked. However, it does not confirm that the splat is definitely not quanked.\n\nNow, let's try to infer if \"The splat is morphed\" based on these statements.\n\nSince the first statement presents two possibilities, and the second statement only suggests that there is a possibility that the splat is not quanked, we cannot definitively conclude that the splat is morphed. There is still a possibility that the splat is quanked, which would make the first statement true.\n\nAnswer: no",
