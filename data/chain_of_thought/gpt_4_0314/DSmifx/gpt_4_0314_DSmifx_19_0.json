One of these must be true.\n\n2. \"The smonk might not be plagged\" - This statement tells us that there is a possibility that the smonk is not plagged. However, it does not confirm that the smonk is definitely not plagged.\n\nNow, let's see if we can infer \"The smonk is vreebled\" from these statements.\n\nSince the first statement tells us that one of the two possibilities (plagged or vreebled) must be true, and the second statement only tells us that there is a possibility that the smonk is not plagged (but does not confirm it), we cannot definitively infer that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: no",
