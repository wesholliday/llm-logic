(This is statement B)\n\nWe are asked if we can infer that Joe went to the park (statement A) based on this information.\n\nThe given information tells us that if Joe went to the park, Lucy would definitely go to the zoo. However, it does not tell us that Joe going to the park is the only way for Lucy to go to the zoo. There could be other reasons for Lucy going to the zoo.\n\nSince we only know that Lucy went to the zoo, but we don't have any information about whether Joe went to the park or not, we cannot infer that Joe went to the park based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
