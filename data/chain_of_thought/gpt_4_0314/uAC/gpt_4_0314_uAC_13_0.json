(This is a given fact)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that the car was red based on these statements.\n\nThe first statement tells us that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. However, it does not tell us that the car being red is the only condition under which the truck can be blue. In other words, the truck being blue does not necessarily mean that the car must be red.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the car was red.\n\nAnswer: no",
