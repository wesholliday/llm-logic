The book is a mystery novel.\n\nFrom this information, we know that if James wrote the book, it must be a mystery novel. However, we are not given any information about whether James is the only author who writes mystery novels. There could be other authors who also write mystery novels.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to conclude that James is the only author who writes mystery novels, we cannot infer that the book was written by James just because it is a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: no",
