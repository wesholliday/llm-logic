The pants were denim.\n\nWe are asked if we can infer that the shirt was cotton based on these statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (shirt being cotton) is true, then the result (pants being denim) must also be true. However, this does not mean that the only way for the pants to be denim is if the shirt is cotton.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the pants were indeed denim. But this information alone does not guarantee that the shirt was cotton. There could be other reasons for the pants being denim that are not mentioned in the given statements.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the shirt was cotton based on the given information. \n\nAnswer: no",
