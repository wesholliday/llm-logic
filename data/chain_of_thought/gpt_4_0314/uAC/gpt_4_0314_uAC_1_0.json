The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true. However, this statement does not guarantee that if Sue is at the wedding, then Mary must be at the wedding as well.\n\nThe second statement tells us that Sue was at the wedding. But this information alone does not provide any direct information about Mary's presence at the wedding.\n\nSince we do not have enough information to confirm Mary's presence at the wedding, we cannot infer that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
