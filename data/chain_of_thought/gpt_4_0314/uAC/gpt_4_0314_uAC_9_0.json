Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the second part (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true. However, this statement does not guarantee that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\n\nThe second statement tells us that Mark bought the blue shirt. But this information alone does not provide enough evidence to conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Lisa bought the red shirt based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
