(This is a given fact)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that Jeff played basketball based on this information.\n\nThe conditional statement tells us that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. However, it does not tell us that Jeff playing basketball is the only way for Amy to play tennis. Amy could have played tennis for other reasons as well.\n\nSince we only know that Amy played tennis, but we don't have any information about whether Jeff played basketball or not, we cannot infer that Jeff played basketball based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
