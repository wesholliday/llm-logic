(This is a given fact: B)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that Tom watched football (A) based on this information.\n\nThe conditional statement (If A, then B) tells us that if Tom watched football, it would lead to Jen watching basketball. However, it does not guarantee that Tom watching football is the only reason for Jen watching basketball. Jen could have watched basketball for other reasons as well.\n\nSince we only know that Jen watched basketball (B) and we don't have any information about whether Tom watched football (A) or not, we cannot infer that Tom watched football based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
