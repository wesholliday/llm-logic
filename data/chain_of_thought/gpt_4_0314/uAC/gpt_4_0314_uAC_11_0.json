The muffins were blueberry.\n\nWe are asked if we can infer that the cake was chocolate based on these statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the cake being chocolate) is true, then the second part (the muffins being blueberry) must also be true. However, this does not mean that the cake being chocolate is the only way for the muffins to be blueberry.\n\nThe second statement confirms that the muffins were indeed blueberry, but it does not provide any information about the cake. It is possible that the cake was chocolate, but it could also be any other flavor.\n\nSince we do not have enough information to definitively conclude that the cake was chocolate, we cannot infer that the cake was chocolate based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
