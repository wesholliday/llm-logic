The banana was yellow. (This is a given fact.)\n\nWe are asked to infer if the apple was red based on these statements.\n\nThe given information tells us that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow. However, it does not tell us that the apple being red is the only condition for the banana to be yellow. The banana could be yellow for other reasons as well.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to conclude that the apple being red is the sole reason for the banana being yellow, we cannot infer that the apple was red.\n\nAnswer: no",
