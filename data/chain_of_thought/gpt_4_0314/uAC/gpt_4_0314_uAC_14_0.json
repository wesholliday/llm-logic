The wolf was in the den.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logic:\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement (if-then statement). It tells us that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf must be in the den. However, it does not tell us anything about what happens if the wolf is in the den without any information about the bear.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the wolf is indeed in the den. But this information alone does not allow us to infer anything about the bear's location.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the bear was in the cave. \n\nAnswer: no",
