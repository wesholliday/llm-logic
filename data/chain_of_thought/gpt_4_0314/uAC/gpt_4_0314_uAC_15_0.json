(This is a given fact)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that Sam took a plane based on this information.\n\nThe given information tells us that if Sam took a plane, Erin would take a train. However, it does not tell us that Erin taking a train is solely dependent on Sam taking a plane. Erin could have taken a train for other reasons as well.\n\nSo, we cannot infer that Sam took a plane just because Erin took a train.\n\nAnswer: no",
