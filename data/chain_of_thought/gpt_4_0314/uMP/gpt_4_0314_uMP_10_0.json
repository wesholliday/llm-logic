Statement 1 is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the dog being inside) is true, then the result (the cat being outside) must also be true.\n\nStatement 2 confirms that the condition (the dog being inside) is true.\n\nSince the condition is true, we can infer that the result (the cat being outside) is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
