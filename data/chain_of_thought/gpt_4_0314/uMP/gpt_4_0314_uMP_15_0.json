Sam took a plane.\n\nWe can use the modus ponens rule of inference, which states that if we have a conditional statement (if P, then Q) and we know that P is true, then we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nIn this case, P is \"Sam took a plane\" and Q is \"Erin took a train.\" Since we know that Sam took a plane (P is true), we can infer that Erin took a train (Q is true).\n\nAnswer: yes",
