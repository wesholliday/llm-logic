The doll was plastic.\n\nWe can use the logical rule of Modus Ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (if P, then Q) and we know that P is true, then we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nIn this case, P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal.\" Since we know that the doll was plastic (P is true), we can apply Modus Ponens and conclude that the truck was metal (Q is true).\n\nAnswer: yes",
