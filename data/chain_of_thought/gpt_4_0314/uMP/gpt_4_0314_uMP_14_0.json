The bear was in the cave. (This is a fact: A is true)\n\nNow, we can use the information from the conditional statement and the fact to make an inference:\n\nSince the bear was in the cave (A is true), and the conditional statement tells us that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den (If A, then B), we can infer that the wolf was in the den (B is true).\n\nAnswer: yes",
