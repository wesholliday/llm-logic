In this case, P represents \"the fribble was snurgled\" and Q represents \"the fribble crinked.\"\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can infer the following statement: \"If the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink.\" This statement can be represented as: If not P, then not Q.\n\nThe original statement (If P, then Q) does not provide enough information to infer the negation of both P and Q (If not P, then not Q). The contrapositive of the original statement would be \"If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled\" (If not Q, then not P), but this is not the same as the statement we are trying to infer.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the given statement from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: no",
