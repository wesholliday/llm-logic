However, the truth of the inverse is not guaranteed by the truth of the original statement. In other words, just because the original statement is true, it does not necessarily mean that the inverse is also true.\n\nFor example, consider the following true statement: \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" The inverse of this statement would be \"If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet.\" However, this inverse is not necessarily true, as there could be other reasons for the ground to be wet, such as a sprinkler system or a spilled bucket of water.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the inverse statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
