The given statement tells us that if A is true, then B is true. However, it does not provide any information about what happens when A is false. It is possible that when A is false, B could still be true or B could be false. We cannot make a definite conclusion about the relationship between not A and not B based on the given statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk was not plagged\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
