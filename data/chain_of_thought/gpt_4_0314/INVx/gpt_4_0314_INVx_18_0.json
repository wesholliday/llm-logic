So, the contrapositive of P \u2192 N would be: \u00acN \u2192 \u00acP\n\nThe contrapositive states: If the shank was not nugged (\u00acN), then the shank was not plooked (\u00acP).\n\nHowever, the question asks if we can infer: If the shank was not plooked (\u00acP), then the shank was not nugged (\u00acN). This statement is different from the contrapositive we found.\n\nSo, based on the given statement, we cannot infer the statement in the question.\n\nAnswer: no",
