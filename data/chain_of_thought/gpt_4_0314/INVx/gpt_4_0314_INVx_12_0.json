The given statement is a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q). The statement we need to infer is the contrapositive of the given statement, which is (~Q \u2192 ~P). \n\nHowever, the statement to infer is not the contrapositive of the given statement. Instead, it is the inverse of the given statement. The inverse of a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) is (~P \u2192 ~Q), which is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the given statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
