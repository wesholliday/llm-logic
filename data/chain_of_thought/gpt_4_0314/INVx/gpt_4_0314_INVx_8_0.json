However, the truth of the inverse is not guaranteed by the truth of the original statement. In other words, just because \"If P, then Q\" is true, it does not necessarily mean that \"If not P, then not Q\" is true.\n\nFor example, consider the statement \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" This statement is true, but its inverse, \"If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet,\" is not necessarily true, as there could be other reasons for the ground to be wet (e.g., someone watering their lawn).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the inverse statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
