(where P = flob was skizzled, Q = flob movated)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer the following statement:\nIf the flob was not skizzled, then the flob was not movated.\nThis can be represented as: If not P, then not Q.\n\nThe given statement (If P, then Q) does not provide enough information to infer the opposite statement (If not P, then not Q). The original statement only tells us what happens when the flob is skizzled, but it does not tell us what happens when the flob is not skizzled.\n\nAnswer: no",
