(A = sneg was crampled, B = sneg sproted the frink)\n\nNow, we want to infer: If the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink.\nThis can be represented as: If not A, then not B. (not A = sneg was not crampled, not B = sneg did not sprot the frink)\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement (If A, then B). The inference we want to make is the inverse of the given statement (If not A, then not B). However, the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true based on the original statement.\n\nFor example, consider the statement: If it is raining, then the ground is wet. The inverse would be: If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet. But the ground could still be wet for other reasons, like someone watering their lawn or a broken water pipe.\n\nSo, based on the given statement, we cannot infer the inverse statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
