However, P \u2192 Q and \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ are not logically equivalent. The given statement (P \u2192 Q) only tells us what happens when the fleeg is bluttered, but it does not provide any information about what happens when the fleeg is not bluttered.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the fleeg was not bluttered, then it did not surn\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
