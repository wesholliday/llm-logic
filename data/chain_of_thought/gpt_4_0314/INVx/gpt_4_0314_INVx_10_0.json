The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and reversing their order. In this case, the contrapositive would be:\n\n\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\nHowever, \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP is not the same as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
