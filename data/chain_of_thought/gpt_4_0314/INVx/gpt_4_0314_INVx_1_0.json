However, the truth of the inverse is not guaranteed by the truth of the original statement. In other words, just because \"If P, then Q\" is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that \"If not P, then not Q\" is true.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot infer the inverse statement. \n\nAnswer: no",
