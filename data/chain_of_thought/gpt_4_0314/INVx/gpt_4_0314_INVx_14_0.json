However, these two statements are not logically equivalent. The given statement (P \u2192 Q) only tells us what happens when the clug is fleeked, but it does not provide any information about what happens when the clug is not fleeked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the clug was not fleeked, then the clug was not snugged\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
