In this case, the contrapositive of the given statement is:\n\n\u00ac(the wug bimmed the zoint) \u2192 \u00ac(the wug was flooped)\n\nThis is not the same as the statement we want to infer (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ). Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the wug was not flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
