It does not confirm or deny whether the alien visited Mars or not; it simply states that there is a chance that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer: \"It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars.\" This statement is essentially saying that it is not necessary or certain that the alien visited Mars.\n\nGiven that the original statement allows for the possibility that the alien did not visit Mars, we can infer that it is not certain or necessary that the alien visited Mars. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
