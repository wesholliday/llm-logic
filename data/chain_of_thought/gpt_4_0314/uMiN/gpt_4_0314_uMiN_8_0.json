It does not confirm or deny whether the vampire was actually awake or not.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Can we infer that it's not the case that the vampire must have been awake?\"\n\nIf there is a possibility that the vampire was not awake, then it means that the vampire's state of being awake is not a certainty or a requirement. In other words, it is not a must that the vampire was awake.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we can infer that it's not the case that the vampire must have been awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
