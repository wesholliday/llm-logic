It does not confirm or deny whether James wrote the book, but it leaves room for doubt.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer: \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James.\" This statement implies that there is no necessity for James to be the author of the book. In other words, it is not a requirement that James wrote the book.\n\nComparing the two statements, we can see that both allow for the possibility that James did not write the book. The first statement introduces doubt, while the second statement negates the necessity of James being the author.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
