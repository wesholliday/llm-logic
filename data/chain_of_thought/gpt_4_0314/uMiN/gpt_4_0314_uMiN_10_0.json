It does not confirm or deny the dog's location, but it does imply that there is some uncertainty about it.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Can we infer that it's not the case that the dog must have been inside?\" To infer this, we need to determine if the given statement allows us to conclude that the dog's presence inside is not a necessity.\n\nSince the given statement suggests that there is a possibility that the dog was not inside, it implies that the dog's presence inside is not a certainty or a must. Therefore, we can infer that it's not the case that the dog must have been inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
