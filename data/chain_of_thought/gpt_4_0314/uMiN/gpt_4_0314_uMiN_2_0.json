It does not confirm or deny the griffin's presence in the forest.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest.\" - This statement negates the idea that the griffin's presence in the forest is a necessity. In other words, it's saying that the griffin's presence in the forest is not mandatory.\n\nNow, let's compare the two statements. The first statement suggests a possibility that the griffin was not in the forest, while the second statement negates the necessity of the griffin being in the forest. Both statements imply that the griffin's presence in the forest is not certain.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer that the second statement is true if the first statement is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
