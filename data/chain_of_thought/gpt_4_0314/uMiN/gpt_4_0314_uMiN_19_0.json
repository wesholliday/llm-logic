It does not confirm whether the watch is charging or not, but it suggests that there is a chance that it is not charging.\n\nNow, let's consider the second part: \"Can we infer that it's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser?\"\n\nThis is asking if we can conclude that it is not necessary for the watch to be charging on the dresser. Since the initial statement suggests that there is a possibility that the watch is not charging on the dresser, we can infer that it is not a requirement for the watch to be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
