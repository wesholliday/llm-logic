It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked.\nThis means that the fribble is not necessarily crinked, or in other words, it's possible that the fribble is not crinked.\n\n2. Either the fribble must be crinked or it is snurgled.\nThis means that if the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\nSince it's possible that the fribble is not crinked (from statement 1), and if the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled (from statement 2), we can infer that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
