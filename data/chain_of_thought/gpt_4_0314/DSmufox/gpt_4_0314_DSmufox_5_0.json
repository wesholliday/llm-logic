It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled.\nThis statement can be represented as \u00acS (where S stands for \"the zinger must be smoogled\").\n\n2. Either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled.\nThis statement can be represented as S \u2228 F (where F stands for \"the zinger is fraggled\").\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer F (the zinger is fraggled) from these two statements.\n\nUsing the first statement, we know that \u00acS is true. Since we have S \u2228 F, and we know that \u00acS is true, the only way for the entire statement to be true is if F is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
