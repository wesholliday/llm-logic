Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled.\nThis means that one of the two conditions must be true: the flob is movated, or the flob is skizzled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information:\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that the flob does not have to be movated, and statement 2 tells us that either the flob is movated or it is skizzled, we can infer that the flob must be skizzled because the other option (the flob is movated) is not true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
