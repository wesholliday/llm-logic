It's not the case that the glip must be tragged.\nThis statement can be represented as \u00acT, where T stands for \"the glip must be tragged.\"\n\n2. Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged.\nThis statement can be represented as T \u2228 S, where S stands for \"the glip is slogged.\"\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer S (the glip is slogged) from these two statements.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can apply the Disjunctive Syllogism. This rule states that if we have a disjunction (T \u2228 S) and the negation of one of the disjuncts (\u00acT), we can infer the other disjunct (S).\n\nIn this case, we have T \u2228 S and \u00acT. Applying the Disjunctive Syllogism, we can infer S.\n\nAnswer: yes",
