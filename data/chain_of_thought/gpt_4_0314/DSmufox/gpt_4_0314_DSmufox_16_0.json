It's not the case that the sneg must be sproted.\nThis statement can be represented as \u00acP, where P is \"the sneg must be sproted.\"\n\n2. Either the sneg must be sproted or it is crampled.\nThis statement can be represented as P \u2228 Q, where Q is \"the sneg is crampled.\"\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer Q (the sneg is crampled) from these two statements.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can apply the Disjunctive Syllogism. This rule states that if we have P \u2228 Q and \u00acP, then we can infer Q.\n\nIn this case, we have \u00acP (It's not the case that the sneg must be sproted) and P \u2228 Q (Either the sneg must be sproted or it is crampled). Therefore, we can infer Q (The sneg is crampled).\n\nAnswer: yes",
