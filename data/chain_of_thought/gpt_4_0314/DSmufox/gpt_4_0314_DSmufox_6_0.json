It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped.\nThis statement is a negation, which means that the grommet must not be plopped.\n\n2. Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed.\nThis statement is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the grommet must be plopped, or it is sploffed.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that the grommet must not be plopped, the only remaining possibility from statement 2 is that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
