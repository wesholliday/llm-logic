It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled.\nThis statement can be represented as \u00acD (not D), where D stands for \"the sprocket must be daggled.\"\n\n2. Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked.\nThis statement can be represented as D \u2228 C, where C stands for \"the sprocket is cranked.\"\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The sprocket is cranked' (C) from these two statements.\n\nSince we know that \u00acD is true (from statement 1), and we have the disjunction D \u2228 C (from statement 2), we can use the principle of disjunctive syllogism. Disjunctive syllogism states that if we have a disjunction (A \u2228 B) and we know that \u00acA is true, then we can conclude that B is true.\n\nIn this case, we have \u00acD and D \u2228 C. Since \u00acD is true, we can conclude that C (the sprocket is cranked) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
