It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled.\nThis statement can be represented as \u00acZ, where Z stands for \"the flugel must be zargled.\"\n\n2. Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed.\nThis statement can be represented as Z \u2228 B, where B stands for \"the flugel is blimmed.\"\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The flugel is blimmed' (B) from these two statements.\n\nUsing the first statement (\u00acZ), we can apply the Disjunctive Syllogism rule, which states that if we have a disjunction (Z \u2228 B) and the negation of one of the disjuncts (\u00acZ), we can infer the other disjunct (B).\n\nSo, since we have \u00acZ and Z \u2228 B, we can infer B, which means \"The flugel is blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
