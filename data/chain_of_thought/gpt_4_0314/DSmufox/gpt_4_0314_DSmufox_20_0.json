Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered.\nThis statement is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the fleeg must be surned, or it is bluttered.\n\nNow, let's use these statements to infer whether the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that the fleeg must not be surned, we can eliminate that possibility from statement 2. This leaves us with only one remaining possibility: the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
