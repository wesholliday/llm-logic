It's not the case that the shank must be nugged.\nThis statement can be represented as \u00acN, where N stands for \"the shank must be nugged.\"\n\n2. Either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked.\nThis statement can be represented as N \u2228 P, where P stands for \"the shank is plooked.\"\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The shank is plooked' (P) from these two statements.\n\nUsing the given information, we can apply the Disjunctive Syllogism rule, which states that if we have a disjunction (N \u2228 P) and the negation of one of the disjuncts (\u00acN), we can infer the other disjunct (P).\n\nSince we have \u00acN and N \u2228 P, we can infer P, which means 'The shank is plooked.'\n\nAnswer: yes",
