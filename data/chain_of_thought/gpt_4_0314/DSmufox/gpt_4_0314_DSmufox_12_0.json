It's not the case that the smip must be lupped.\nThis statement can be represented as \u00acL, where L stands for \"the smip must be lupped.\"\n\n2. Either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped.\nThis statement can be represented as L \u2228 S, where S stands for \"the smip is shripped.\"\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer S (the smip is shripped) from these two statements.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can apply the Disjunctive Syllogism. This rule states that if we have a disjunction (L \u2228 S) and the negation of one of the disjuncts (\u00acL), we can infer the other disjunct (S).\n\nIn this case, we have \u00acL and L \u2228 S. Applying the Disjunctive Syllogism, we can infer S.\n\nAnswer: yes",
