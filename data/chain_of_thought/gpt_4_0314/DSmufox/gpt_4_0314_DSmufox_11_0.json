It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed.\nThis statement is a negation, which means that the flug being zimmed is false.\n\n2. Either the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed.\nThis statement is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions (the flug being zimmed or the flug being blummed) must be true.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\nSince we know that the flug being zimmed is false (from statement 1), and we know that at least one of the conditions in statement 2 must be true, the only remaining possibility is that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
