Since statement 2 tells us that one of the two conditions must be true, and we know that the first condition (the twonk must be plinked) is false, the only remaining possibility is that the second condition (the twonk is varnished) is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
