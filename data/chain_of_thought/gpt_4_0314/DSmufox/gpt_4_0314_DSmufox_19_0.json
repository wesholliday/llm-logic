Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled.\nThis statement is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the conditions (smonk being plagged or smonk being vreebled) must be true.\n\nNow, we know from statement 1 that the smonk is not plagged. Since statement 2 tells us that at least one of the conditions must be true, and we know that the smonk is not plagged, the only remaining option is that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
