It's not the case that the splat must be quanked.\nThis statement can be represented as \u00acQ, where Q stands for \"the splat must be quanked.\"\n\n2. Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed.\nThis statement can be represented as Q \u2228 M, where M stands for \"the splat is morphed.\"\n\nNow, we want to infer if the splat is morphed (M) from these two statements.\n\nSince we know \u00acQ (it's not the case that the splat must be quanked) and Q \u2228 M (either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed), we can use the disjunction elimination rule. This rule states that if we have \u00acQ and Q \u2228 M, we can infer M.\n\nSo, using the disjunction elimination rule, we can infer that the splat is morphed (M).\n\nAnswer: yes",
