It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked.\nThis statement is a negation, which means that the whiffle must NOT be tinked.\n\n2. Either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked.\nThis statement is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the whiffle must be tinked, or it is shanked.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that the whiffle must NOT be tinked, we can eliminate that option from statement 2. This leaves us with only one possibility: the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
