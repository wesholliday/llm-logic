It's not the case that the wug must be garpled.\nThis statement can be represented as \u00acG (not G), where G stands for \"the wug must be garpled.\"\n\n2. Either the wug must be garpled or it is sproinged.\nThis statement can be represented as G \u2228 S, where S stands for \"the wug is sproinged.\"\n\nNow, we want to infer if the wug is sproinged (S) from these two statements.\n\nSince we know \u00acG (not G) is true from statement 1, and we have G \u2228 S from statement 2, we can use the principle of disjunction elimination (also known as the law of excluded middle) to infer S.\n\nDisjunction elimination states that if \u00acA is true and A \u2228 B is true, then B must be true.\n\nIn this case, \u00acG is true and G \u2228 S is true, so we can infer that S (the wug is sproinged) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
