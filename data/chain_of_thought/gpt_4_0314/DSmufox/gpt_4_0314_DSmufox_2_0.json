It's not the case that the wug must be bimmed.\nThis statement can be represented as \u00acB, where B stands for \"the wug must be bimmed.\"\n\n2. Either the wug must be bimmed or it is flooped.\nThis statement can be represented as B \u2228 F, where F stands for \"the wug is flooped.\"\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer F (the wug is flooped) from these two statements.\n\nSince we know \u00acB (it's not the case that the wug must be bimmed) is true, and we have the statement B \u2228 F (either the wug must be bimmed or it is flooped), we can use the principle of disjunction elimination. Disjunction elimination states that if \u00acB is true and B \u2228 F is true, then F must be true.\n\nSo, given the information provided, we can infer that the wug is flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
