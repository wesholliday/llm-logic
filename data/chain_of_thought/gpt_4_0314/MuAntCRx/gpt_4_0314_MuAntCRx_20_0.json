In this case, we have the statement \"The quazzle must gribble crunk.\" We are asked to infer if \"The quazzle must quork blurble and gribble crunk\" can be concluded from the given statement. The given statement does not provide any information about \"quork blurble,\" so we cannot infer that \"The quazzle must quork blurble and gribble crunk\" based on the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
