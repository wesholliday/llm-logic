It does not mention anything about a frazzle or any relationship between the quazzle, frazzle, and flibbit. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement, \"The quazzle must be frazzle by flibbit and be flibbit by zizz,\" based solely on the information provided in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
