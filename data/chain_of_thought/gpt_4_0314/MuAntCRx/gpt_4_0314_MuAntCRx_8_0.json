In this case, we are given the statement \"The wibble must wibble fribble zizz\" and asked if we can infer \"The wibble must blimp zibble plimp and wibble fribble zizz\" from it. The original statement only provides information about the wibble's relationship to wibble fribble zizz. It does not provide any information about the wibble's relationship to blimp zibble plimp. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first statement, as there is no evidence or reasoning to support the additional information about blimp zibble plimp.\n\nAnswer: no",
