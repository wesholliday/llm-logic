In this case, we have two nonsensical statements with made-up words. However, we can still analyze the structure of the statements to see if there is any logical connection between them.\n\nThe first statement is: \"The grooble must frazzle quibble wibble.\"\nThe second statement is: \"The grooble must snork wozzle grooble and frazzle quibble wibble.\"\n\nThe second statement contains the entire first statement (\"frazzle quibble wibble\") and adds some additional information (\"snork wozzle grooble\"). Since the second statement includes the first statement and adds more information, we can infer that if the first statement is true, the second statement could also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
