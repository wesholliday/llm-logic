In this case, we are given the statement \"The wobble must be quork fizzle frozz\" and asked if we can infer \"The wobble must be glorp quank quork and be quork fizzle frozz\" from it. The original statement only provides information about the wobble being \"quork fizzle frozz.\" It does not provide any information about the wobble being \"glorp quank quork.\" Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first statement, as there is no evidence or reasoning to support the additional information about the wobble being \"glorp quank quork.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
