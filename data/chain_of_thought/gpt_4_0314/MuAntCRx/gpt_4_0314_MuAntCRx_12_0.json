In this case, the original statement is \"The frozz must be fizzle blimple.\" We are asked to infer if \"The frozz must be flump frazzle and be fizzle blimple\" from the original statement. The original statement does not provide any information about \"flump frazzle,\" so we cannot infer that \"The frozz must be flump frazzle and be fizzle blimple\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
