It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. (Premise 2)\n\nNow, we want to see if the conclusion \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" logically follows from these premises.\n\nThe argument is in the form of a Modus Tollens, which is a valid argument form. Modus Tollens has the following structure:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\nConclusion: Not P.\n\nIn our case, P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" The argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens:\n\n1. If P (Lisa bought the red shirt), then Q (Mark must have bought the blue shirt).\n2. Not Q (It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt).\nConclusion: Not P (Lisa did not buy the red shirt).\n\nSince the argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
