It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter. (Premise 2)\n\nNow, we want to determine if the conclusion \"The alien did not visit Mars\" logically follows from these premises.\n\nThis argument is an example of the logical form called Modus Tollens, which has the following structure:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\nConclusion: Not P.\n\nIn our case, P is \"the alien visited Mars\" and Q is \"the robot must have visited Jupiter\". The argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens:\n\n1. If P (the alien visited Mars), then Q (the robot must have visited Jupiter).\n2. Not Q (It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter).\nConclusion: Not P (The alien did not visit Mars).\n\nSince the argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
