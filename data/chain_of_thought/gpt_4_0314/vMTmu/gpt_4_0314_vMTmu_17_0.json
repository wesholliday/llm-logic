(Premise 2)\n\nNow, we want to determine if the conclusion \"Ben did not eat pasta\" logically follows from these premises.\n\nThis argument is an example of the logical form called Modus Tollens, which has the following structure:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P represents \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q represents \"Kate must have eaten salad.\" The argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens:\n\n1. If P (Ben ate pasta), then Q (Kate must have eaten salad).\n2. Not Q (It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad).\n3. Therefore, not P (Ben did not eat pasta).\n\nSince the argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
