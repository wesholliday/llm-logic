It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry. (Not B)\n\nNow, we want to see if the conclusion \"The cake was not chocolate\" (Not A) logically follows from these premises.\n\nThis argument is an example of the logical form called Modus Tollens, which has the following structure:\n\n1. If A, then B.\n2. Not B.\n3. Therefore, Not A.\n\nIn this case, A represents \"the cake was chocolate\" and B represents \"the muffins must have been blueberry.\" Since the argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
