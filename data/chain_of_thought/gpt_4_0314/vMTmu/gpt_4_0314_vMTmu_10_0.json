It's not the case that the cat must have been outside. (Premise 2)\n\nNow, we want to determine if the conclusion \"The dog was not inside\" logically follows from these premises.\n\nThe argument is in the form of a Modus Tollens, which is a valid argument form. Modus Tollens has the following structure:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\nConclusion: Not P.\n\nComparing this structure to the given argument:\n\n1. If the dog was inside (P), then the cat must have been outside (Q).\n2. It's not the case that the cat must have been outside (Not Q).\nConclusion: The dog was not inside (Not P).\n\nSince the given argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
