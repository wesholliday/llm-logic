(Premise 2)\n\nNow, we want to determine if the conclusion \"Sue did not choose pizza\" logically follows from these premises.\n\nThe argument is in the form of a Modus Tollens, which is a valid argument form. Modus Tollens has the following structure:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P represents \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q represents \"Bob must have chosen pasta.\" The argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens:\n\n1. If P (Sue chose pizza), then Q (Bob must have chosen pasta).\n2. Not Q (It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta).\n3. Therefore, not P (Sue did not choose pizza).\n\nSince the argument follows the structure of a valid argument form (Modus Tollens), it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
