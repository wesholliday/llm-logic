It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. (Premise 2)\n\nNow, we want to determine if the conclusion \"Tom did not watch football\" logically follows from these premises.\n\nThis argument is an example of the logical form called Modus Tollens, which has the following structure:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P represents \"Tom watched football\" and Q represents \"Jen must have watched basketball.\" The argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens:\n\n1. If P (Tom watched football), then Q (Jen must have watched basketball).\n2. Not Q (It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball).\n3. Therefore, not P (Tom did not watch football).\n\nSince the argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
