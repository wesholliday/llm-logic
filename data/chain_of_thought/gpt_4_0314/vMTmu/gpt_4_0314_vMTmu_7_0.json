It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race. (Premise 2)\n3. Alex did not finish the race. (Conclusion)\n\nThis argument is in the form of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (if P, then Q) and the negation of the consequent (not Q), we can conclude the negation of the antecedent (not P).\n\nIn this case:\n- P: Alex finished the race.\n- Q: Chris must have finished the race.\n\nThe argument follows the pattern of modus tollens:\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nSo, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
