It's not the case that the pants must have been denim. (Not B)\n\nNow, we want to determine if the conclusion \"The shirt was not cotton\" (Not A) logically follows from these premises.\n\nThis argument is an example of the logical form called Modus Tollens, which has the following structure:\n\n1. If A, then B.\n2. Not B.\n3. Therefore, Not A.\n\nIn this case, A represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and B represents \"the pants must have been denim.\" Since the argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
