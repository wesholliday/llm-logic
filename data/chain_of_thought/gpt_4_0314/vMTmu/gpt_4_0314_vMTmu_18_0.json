It's not the case that the truck must have been metal. (Premise 2)\n\nNow, we want to determine if the conclusion \"The doll was not plastic\" logically follows from these premises.\n\nThis argument is an example of the logical form called Modus Tollens, which has the following structure:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P represents \"the doll was plastic\" and Q represents \"the truck must have been metal.\" The argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens:\n\n1. If P (the doll was plastic), then Q (the truck must have been metal).\n2. Not Q (it's not the case that the truck must have been metal).\n3. Therefore, not P (the doll was not plastic).\n\nSince the argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
