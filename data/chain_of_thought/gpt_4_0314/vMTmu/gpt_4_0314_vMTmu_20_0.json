It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow. (Not B)\n\nNow, we want to determine if the conclusion \"The apple was not red\" (Not A) logically follows from these premises.\n\nThis argument is an example of the logical form called Modus Tollens, which has the following structure:\n\n1. If A, then B.\n2. Not B.\n3. Therefore, Not A.\n\nIn this case, A represents \"the apple was red\" and B represents \"the banana must have been yellow.\" Since the argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
