It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake. (Not Q)\n3. The vampire was not awake. (Not P)\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument. In Modus Tollens, if the first premise is true (If P, then Q) and the second premise is also true (Not Q), then the conclusion (Not P) must be true.\n\nSo, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
