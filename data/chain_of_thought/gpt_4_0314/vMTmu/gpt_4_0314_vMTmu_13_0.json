(Premise 2)\n\nNow, we want to determine if the conclusion \"The car was not red\" logically follows from these premises.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If P (the car was red), then Q (the truck must have been blue). The second premise is the negation of Q, which can be represented as: not Q (the truck was not necessarily blue).\n\nIn order to determine if the conclusion logically follows, we can use the contrapositive of the first premise. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the antecedent and the consequent and reversing their order. So, the contrapositive of the first premise would be: If not Q (the truck was not necessarily blue), then not P (the car was not red).\n\nComparing the contrapositive of the first premise with the second premise, we see that they match: If not Q, then not P. Therefore, the conclusion \"The car was not red\" (not P) logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
