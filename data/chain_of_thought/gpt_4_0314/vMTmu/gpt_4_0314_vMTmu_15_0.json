(Premise 2)\n\nNow, we want to determine if the conclusion \"Sam did not take a plane\" logically follows from these premises.\n\nThe argument is in the form of a Modus Tollens, which is a valid argument form. Modus Tollens has the following structure:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nComparing this structure to the given argument:\n\n1. If Sam took a plane (P), then Erin must have taken a train (Q).\n2. It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train (Not Q).\n3. Therefore, Sam did not take a plane (Not P).\n\nSince the given argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
