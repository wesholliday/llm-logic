It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis. (Not Q)\n\nNow, we want to determine if the conclusion \"Jeff did not play basketball\" (Not P) logically follows from these premises.\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which can be represented as:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Not Q\nConclusion: Not P\n\nIn this case, P represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q represents \"Amy must have played tennis.\" Since the argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
