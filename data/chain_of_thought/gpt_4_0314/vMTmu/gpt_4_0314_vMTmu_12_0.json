It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo. (Premise 2)\n\nNow, we want to determine if the conclusion \"Joe did not go to the park\" logically follows from these premises.\n\nThis argument is an example of modus tollens, a valid form of argument. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (like premise 1) and we know the consequent is false (like premise 2), then we can conclude that the antecedent is also false.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" The consequent is \"Lucy must have gone to the zoo,\" and we know from premise 2 that this is false. Therefore, we can conclude that the antecedent, \"Joe went to the park,\" is also false, which means \"Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
