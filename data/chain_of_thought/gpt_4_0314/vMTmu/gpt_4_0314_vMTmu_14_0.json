It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den. (Not B)\n3. The bear was not in the cave. (Not A)\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument. In Modus Tollens, if the first premise is true (If A, then B) and the second premise is true (Not B), then the conclusion (Not A) must also be true.\n\nSo, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
