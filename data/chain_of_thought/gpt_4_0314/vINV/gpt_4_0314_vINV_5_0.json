This can be represented as P \u2192 Q.\n\nThe conclusion is given as: If Jeff did not play basketball (\u00acP), then Amy did not play tennis (\u00acQ). This can be represented as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical validity of the argument. An argument is logically valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nIn this case, the premise P \u2192 Q does not necessarily imply the conclusion \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ. This is because it is possible for Jeff not to play basketball (\u00acP) and Amy still to play tennis (Q). The premise only tells us what happens if Jeff plays basketball, not what happens if he doesn't.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
