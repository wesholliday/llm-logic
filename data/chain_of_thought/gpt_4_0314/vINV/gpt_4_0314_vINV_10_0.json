An argument is logically valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the premise being true (P \u2192 Q) does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ). It is possible for the dog to be outside (\u00acP) and the cat to still be outside (Q). This would make the premise true, but the conclusion false.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
