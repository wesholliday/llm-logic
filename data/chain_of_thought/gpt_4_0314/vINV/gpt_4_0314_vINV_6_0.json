This can be represented as P \u2192 Q.\n\nThe conclusion is: If Sue did not choose pizza (~P), then Bob did not choose pasta (~Q). This can be represented as ~P \u2192 ~Q.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. In other words, we need to check if (P \u2192 Q) implies (~P \u2192 ~Q).\n\nHowever, this is not the case. The given premise (P \u2192 Q) only tells us what happens when Sue chooses pizza, but it doesn't provide any information about what happens when Sue does not choose pizza. Therefore, we cannot conclude that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: no",
