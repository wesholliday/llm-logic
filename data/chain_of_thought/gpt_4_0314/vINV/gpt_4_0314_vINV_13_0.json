An argument is logically valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. In other words, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the premise being true (P \u2192 Q) does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion (~P \u2192 ~Q). For example, it is possible that the car was not red, but the truck was still blue for some other reason. This means that the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
