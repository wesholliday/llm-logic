This can be represented as P \u2192 Q.\n\nThe given conclusion is: If Ben did not eat pasta (~P), then Kate did not eat salad (~Q). This can be represented as ~P \u2192 ~Q.\n\nNow, let's examine if the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nThe premise P \u2192 Q does not provide any information about what happens when Ben does not eat pasta (~P). Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad (~P \u2192 ~Q).\n\nAnswer: no",
