            "content": "Let's analyze the argument step by step.\n\nThe premise is given as: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. We can represent this as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the vampire was awake\" and Q is \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\nThe conclusion is given as: If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake. We can represent this as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ, where \u00acP is \"the vampire was not awake\" and \u00acQ is \"the mummy was not awake.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if the argument is logically valid. An argument is logically valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nIn this case, the premise P \u2192 Q does not necessarily imply the conclusion \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ. This is because it is possible for the vampire to be not awake (\u00acP) and the mummy to still be awake (Q). The premise only tells us what happens when the vampire is awake, not when the vampire is not awake.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
