An argument is logically valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nIn this case, the premise P \u2192 Q does not necessarily imply the conclusion ~P \u2192 ~Q. The premise only tells us what happens when the apple is red, but it doesn't give us any information about what happens when the apple is not red. It is possible that the apple is not red and the banana is still yellow, which would make the conclusion false.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
