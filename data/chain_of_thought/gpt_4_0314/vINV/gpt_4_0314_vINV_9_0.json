            "content": "Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. The premise is given as: If Lisa bought the red shirt (P), then Mark bought the blue shirt (Q). This can be represented as P \u2192 Q.\n\n2. The conclusion is given as: If Lisa did not buy the red shirt (~P), then Mark did not buy the blue shirt (~Q). This can be represented as ~P \u2192 ~Q.\n\nNow, let's examine if the conclusion follows logically from the premise:\n\nThe argument is trying to establish a relationship between the negations of P and Q. However, the premise only establishes a relationship between P and Q. The premise does not provide any information about what happens when Lisa does not buy the red shirt.\n\nIn order to determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. In this case, it does not. The premise only tells us what happens if Lisa buys the red shirt, but it does not tell us what happens if she does not buy the red shirt. Therefore, we cannot conclude that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
