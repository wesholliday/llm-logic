This can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P represents \"Joe went to the park\" and Q represents \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nThe conclusion is given as: If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo. This can be represented as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ, where \u00acP represents \"Joe did not go to the park\" and \u00acQ represents \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the logical validity of this argument. An argument is logically valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. In this case, the premise only tells us what happens if Joe goes to the park (Lucy goes to the zoo). It does not provide any information about what happens if Joe does not go to the park. Therefore, we cannot conclude that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: no",
