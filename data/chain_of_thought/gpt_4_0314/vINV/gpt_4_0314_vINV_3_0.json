The premise states that if the book was written by James, it must be a mystery novel. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the book was not written by James. It is possible that even if the book was not written by James, it could still be a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise, and the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
