            "content": "Let's analyze the argument step by step.\n\nThe premise is given as: If Tom watched football (P), then Jen watched basketball (Q). This can be represented as P \u2192 Q.\n\nThe conclusion is given as: If Tom did not watch football (\u00acP), then Jen did not watch basketball (\u00acQ). This can be represented as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ.\n\nNow, we need to determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In other words, we need to check if (P \u2192 Q) implies (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ).\n\nThe given argument is an example of the fallacy of denying the antecedent. The fallacy occurs when the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP) is used to infer the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ). However, this form of argument is not logically valid because it is possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion to be false.\n\nFor example, consider a situation where Tom did not watch football (\u00acP), but Jen still watched basketball (Q). In this case, the premise (P \u2192 Q) is true, but the conclusion (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ) is false.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
