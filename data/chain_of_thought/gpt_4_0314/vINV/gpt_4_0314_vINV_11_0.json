We can represent this as: If P, then Q.\n\n2. The conclusion is given as: If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry. We can represent this as: If not P, then not Q.\n\nNow, let's examine the logical validity of this argument.\n\nA logically valid argument is one where if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. In this case, we need to determine if the truth of the premise (If P, then Q) guarantees the truth of the conclusion (If not P, then not Q).\n\nThe premise (If P, then Q) only tells us what happens when the cake is chocolate (P is true). It does not provide any information about what happens when the cake is not chocolate (P is false). Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry (If not P, then not Q).\n\nAnswer: no",
