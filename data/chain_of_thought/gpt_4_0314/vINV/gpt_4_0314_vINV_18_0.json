Symbolically, this can be represented as P \u2192 Q.\n\nThe conclusion is another conditional statement: If the doll was not plastic (~P), then the truck was not metal (~Q). Symbolically, this can be represented as ~P \u2192 ~Q.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical validity of the argument. An argument is logically valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. In this case, we need to determine if ~P \u2192 ~Q necessarily follows from P \u2192 Q.\n\nThe given argument is an example of the fallacy of denying the antecedent. This fallacy occurs when the negation of the antecedent (P) is used to infer the negation of the consequent (Q). However, this form of argument is not logically valid because it is possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion to be false.\n\nFor example, consider a situation where the doll is not plastic, but the truck is still metal. In this case, the premise (P \u2192 Q) is true, but the conclusion (~P \u2192 ~Q) is false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
