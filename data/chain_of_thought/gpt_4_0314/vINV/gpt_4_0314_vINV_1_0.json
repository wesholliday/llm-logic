            "content": "Let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. The premise is given as: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This can be represented as: If M, then S.\n\n2. The conclusion is given as: If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding. This can be represented as: If not M, then not S.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical validity of this argument:\n\nA logically valid argument is one where if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. In this case, we need to determine if the truth of the premise (If M, then S) guarantees the truth of the conclusion (If not M, then not S).\n\nHowever, the premise only tells us what happens if Mary is at the wedding (Sue is also at the wedding). It does not provide any information about what happens if Mary is not at the wedding. It is possible that Sue could still be at the wedding even if Mary is not there. Therefore, the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
