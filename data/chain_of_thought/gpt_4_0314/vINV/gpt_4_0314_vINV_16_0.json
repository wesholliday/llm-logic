The premise only tells us what happens when the shirt is cotton (P \u2192 Q), but it doesn't provide any information about what happens when the shirt is not cotton (\u00acP). Therefore, we cannot conclude that if the shirt is not cotton, then the pants are not denim (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ).\n\nAnswer: no",
