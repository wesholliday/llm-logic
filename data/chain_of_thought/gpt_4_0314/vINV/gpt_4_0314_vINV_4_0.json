This can be represented as P \u2192 Q.\n\n2. The conclusion is given as: If the alien did not visit Mars (~P), then the robot did not visit Jupiter (~Q). This can be represented as ~P \u2192 ~Q.\n\nNow, let's examine if the conclusion follows logically from the premise:\n\n3. The premise P \u2192 Q is equivalent to its contrapositive, which is ~Q \u2192 ~P. This means that if the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\n\n4. However, the conclusion is ~P \u2192 ~Q, which is the inverse of the premise, not the contrapositive. The inverse and the original statement are not logically equivalent.\n\nSince the conclusion does not follow logically from the premise, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
