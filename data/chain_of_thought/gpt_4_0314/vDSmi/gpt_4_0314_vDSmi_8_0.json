This can be represented as A \u2228 B.\n2. Second premise: The remote control might not be hiding under the couch (\u00acB).\n3. Conclusion: The remote control is on the coffee table (A).\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion (A) necessarily follows from the premises (A \u2228 B) and (\u00acB).\n\nIf we know that either A or B is true (A \u2228 B) and we also know that B might not be true (\u00acB), then it is possible that A is true. However, the second premise does not definitively state that B is false, only that it might not be true. Therefore, we cannot be certain that A is true based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
