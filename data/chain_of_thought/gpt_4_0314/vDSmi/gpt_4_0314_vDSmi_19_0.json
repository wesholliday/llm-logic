This is an \"A or B\" statement.\n2. Second premise: The watch might not be on his wrist (not B). This statement implies that there is a possibility that B is false.\n3. Conclusion: The watch is charging on the dresser (A).\n\nIn order for the argument to be logically valid, the conclusion must necessarily follow from the premises. However, in this case, the second premise only states that there is a possibility that B is false, not that it is definitely false. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that A is true based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
