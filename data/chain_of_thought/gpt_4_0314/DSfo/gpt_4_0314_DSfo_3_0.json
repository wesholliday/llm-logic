Either the keys are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the keys are not in the cabinet. Statement 2 presents us with two possibilities: either the keys are in the cabinet (which we already know is false from statement 1) or they are in the drawer.\n\nSince the first possibility (keys in the cabinet) is false, the only remaining possibility is that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
