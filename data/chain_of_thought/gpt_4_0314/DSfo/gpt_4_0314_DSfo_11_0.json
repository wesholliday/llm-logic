Either the newspaper is sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nSince statement 1 says that the newspaper isn't on the porch, and statement 2 presents two possibilities (either on the porch or in the driveway), we can eliminate the possibility of the newspaper being on the porch based on statement 1.\n\nWith only one possibility remaining (the newspaper being in the driveway), we can infer that the newspaper is indeed in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes",
