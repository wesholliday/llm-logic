Either the cookies are hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information:\n\nSince statement 1 tells us that the cookies are not in the pantry, and statement 2 tells us that the cookies are either in the pantry or in the jar, we can infer that the cookies must be in the jar because the only other option (the pantry) has been ruled out.\n\nAnswer: yes",
