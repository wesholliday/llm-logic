Either the phone is ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nSince statement 1 says that the phone isn't ringing in the kitchen, we can eliminate the possibility of the phone being in the kitchen.\n\nStatement 2 presents two possibilities: the phone is ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room. Since we already know from statement 1 that the phone isn't ringing in the kitchen, the only remaining possibility is that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes",
