Either the notebook is sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer.\n\nWe are asked if we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nSince we know that the notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand (from statement 1), and we also know that either the notebook is sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer (from statement 2), we can eliminate the possibility of the notebook being on the nightstand. The only remaining option is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
