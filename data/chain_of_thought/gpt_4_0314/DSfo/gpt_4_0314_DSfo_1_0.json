Either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside.\n\nNow, let's use these statements to infer whether Fido is inside or not.\n\nSince statement 1 tells us that Fido is not in the garden, and statement 2 tells us that Fido must be either in the garden or inside, we can conclude that Fido must be inside because the only other option (Fido being in the garden) has been ruled out by statement 1.\n\nAnswer: yes",
