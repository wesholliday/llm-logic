Either the missing sock is under the bed or it's in the laundry basket.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the missing sock is definitely not under the bed.\n\nStatement 2 presents two possibilities: the missing sock is either under the bed or in the laundry basket. Since we already know from Statement 1 that the sock is not under the bed, the only remaining possibility is that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
