The first possibility is that the quibble is on the quibble, and the second possibility is that the quibble is in the fizzle. Since the statement presents these as distinct possibilities, we can infer that one of the possibilities is true, which is \"The quibble might be in the fizzle.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
