The alternative statement \"The concert must have been sold out or had limited tickets\" presents two possibilities: either the concert was sold out, or it had limited tickets. Since the original statement confirms that the concert was sold out, it automatically satisfies the condition of the alternative statement, as one of the two possibilities is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
