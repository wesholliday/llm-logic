Now, we are asked if we can infer \"The keys must be in the drawer or on the table\" from the given statement. Since the keys are already confirmed to be in the drawer, adding the possibility of them being on the table does not contradict the original statement. In other words, the keys being in the drawer is a subset of the keys being either in the drawer or on the table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
