We are given two possibilities for the location of the scarf: either it is stuffed in the backpack or it is draped on the coat rack.\n2. We are also given that the scarf is not draped on the coat rack.\n\nSince there are only two possible locations for the scarf and we know that it is not in one of them (the coat rack), we can infer that it must be in the other location.\n\nAnswer: yes",
