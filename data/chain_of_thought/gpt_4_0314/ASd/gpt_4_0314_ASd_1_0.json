However, it does not provide any information about the conditions under which the match is struck.\n\nInferred statement: \"If the match is struck and it has been soaked in water, then it will light.\"\nThis statement is adding a condition to the given statement, which is that the match has been soaked in water. We know that a match soaked in water will likely not light, even if it is struck.\n\nSince the given statement does not provide any information about the conditions under which the match is struck, we cannot infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: no",
