The given statement tells us that placing an order (P) will result in the item shipping (Q). However, it does not provide any information about the stock status of the item (R). \n\nTo infer the new statement, we need to know if the item being out of stock (R) has any impact on the item shipping (Q) when the order is placed (P). Since we don't have any information about the relationship between the item's stock status (R) and the item shipping (Q), we cannot infer the new statement based on the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
