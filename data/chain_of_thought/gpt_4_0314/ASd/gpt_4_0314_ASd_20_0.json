The new statement is \"If I take medication that expired, I will feel better.\" This is a specific case of taking medication, where the medication has expired.\n\n3. Expired medication may not have the same effectiveness as non-expired medication, and in some cases, it could be harmful or have reduced potency.\n\n4. Since the original statement does not specify the condition of the medication (whether it's expired or not), we cannot directly infer the new statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
