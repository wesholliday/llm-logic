If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired.\nThis statement implies that getting enough sleep is a sufficient condition for not being tired.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement:\n\n2. If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired.\nThis statement implies that getting enough sleep and doing hard labor together are sufficient conditions for not being tired.\n\nHowever, the first statement does not provide any information about the effect of hard labor on tiredness. It only tells us about the relationship between sleep and tiredness. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
