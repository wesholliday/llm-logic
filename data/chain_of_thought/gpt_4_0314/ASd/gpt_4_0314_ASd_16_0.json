However, it does not mention any other factors that might affect the lawn's health.\n\nThe second statement is: \"If I fertilize the lawn and there is a drought, it will be lush and green.\" This statement combines two conditions: fertilizing the lawn and the presence of a drought. The question is whether we can infer this statement from the first one.\n\nThe first statement does not provide any information about how the lawn would be affected by a drought. It is possible that even with fertilization, a drought could prevent the lawn from being lush and green. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: no",
