We know that a well-written essay is a sufficient condition for getting an A.\n2. However, the given statement does not provide any information about the effect of turning in the essay late on the student's grade.\n3. It is possible that turning in the essay late could result in a lower grade, even if the essay is well-written.\n\nSince we do not have enough information about the effect of turning in the essay late, we cannot infer the statement 'If the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A'.\n\nAnswer: no",
