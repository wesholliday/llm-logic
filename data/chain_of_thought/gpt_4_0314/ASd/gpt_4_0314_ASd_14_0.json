In other words, if you study hard, you are guaranteed to pass the test.\n\nThe second statement is: \"If I study hard and the test is in Chinese, I will pass the test.\" This statement adds an additional condition to the first statement, which is that the test is in Chinese.\n\nNow, let's think about whether we can infer the second statement from the first statement. The first statement tells us that studying hard guarantees passing the test, but it does not provide any information about the language of the test. Therefore, we cannot infer that studying hard will guarantee passing the test if it is in Chinese, as the first statement does not address the language of the test.\n\nAnswer: no",
