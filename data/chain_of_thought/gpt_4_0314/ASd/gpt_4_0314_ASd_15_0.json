If the battery is completely dead and cannot hold a charge, then charging the phone will not result in it having power. However, if the battery is just drained and not completely dead, charging the phone will indeed result in it having power.\n\nSince the original statement does not specify the condition of the battery, we cannot definitively infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: no",
