Weight loss generally occurs when the calories burned are greater than the calories consumed. Exercise can help increase the number of calories burned, but eating junk food can increase the number of calories consumed.\n\nThe first statement does not provide any information about the impact of eating junk food on weight loss. It only states that exercising will lead to weight loss. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first statement, as it introduces an additional factor (eating junk food) that is not addressed in the first statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
