The given statement only tells us that if the car is in the garage, it is safe. It does not provide any information about the safety of the car when the garage is flooding.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement (A \u2227 C) \u2192 B from the given statement A \u2192 B, as there is no information about the condition C (garage flooding) in the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
