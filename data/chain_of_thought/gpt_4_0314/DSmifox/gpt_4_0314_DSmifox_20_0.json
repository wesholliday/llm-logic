It does not confirm whether the fleeg is surned or not.\n\n2. \"Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered\" - This statement presents two possibilities: the fleeg is either surned or bluttered. It is an \"or\" statement, meaning that at least one of the conditions must be true.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements and see if we can infer \"The fleeg is bluttered\":\n\nSince there is a possibility that the fleeg is not surned (from statement 1), and we know that either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered (from statement 2), we can infer that if the fleeg is not surned, then it must be bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
