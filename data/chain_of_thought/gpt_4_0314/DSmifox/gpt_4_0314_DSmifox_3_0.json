Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the splat is quanked, or the splat is morphed.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information:\n\nSince there is a possibility that the splat is not quanked (from statement 1), we can look at the second statement to see what happens in that case. If the splat is not quanked, then according to statement 2, it must be morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
