It does not confirm whether the dreb is spened or not.\n\n2. \"Either the dreb must be spened or it is vroombed\" - This statement presents two possibilities: the dreb is spened, or the dreb is vroombed. At least one of these possibilities must be true.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements and see if we can infer \"The dreb is vroombed\":\n\nSince the first statement tells us that there is a possibility that the dreb is not spened, and the second statement tells us that if the dreb is not spened, then it must be vroombed, we can infer that if the dreb is not spened, it is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
