Either the wug must be garpled or it is sproinged.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there is a possibility that the wug is not garpled. Statement 2 presents two options: the wug is either garpled or sproinged. Since there is a possibility that the wug is not garpled (from statement 1), we can infer that the wug must be sproinged to satisfy statement 2.\n\nAnswer: yes",
