Either the fribble must be crinked or it is snurgled: This means that if the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information:\n\nSince there is a possibility that the fribble is not crinked (from statement 1), and if it's not crinked, it must be snurgled (from statement 2), we can infer that there is a possibility that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nHowever, the question asks if we can definitively infer that \"The fribble is snurgled.\" Based on the given information, we cannot say for certain that the fribble is snurgled, only that it might be.\n\nAnswer: no",
