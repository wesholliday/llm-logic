Either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there is a possibility that the zinger is not smoogled. Statement 2 presents two options: the zinger is either smoogled or fraggled. Since there is a possibility that the zinger is not smoogled, and the only other option given is that it is fraggled, we can infer that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
