Either the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed.\nThis statement is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the flug is zimmed or the flug is blummed.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information:\n\nSince there is a possibility that the flug is not zimmed (from statement 1), and we know that either the flug is zimmed or it is blummed (from statement 2), we can infer that if the flug is not zimmed, then it must be blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
