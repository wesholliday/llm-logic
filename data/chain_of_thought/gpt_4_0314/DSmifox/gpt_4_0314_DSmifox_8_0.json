Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the sprocket is daggled, or the sprocket is cranked.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information:\n\nSince there is a possibility that the sprocket is not daggled (from statement 1), and we know that either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked (from statement 2), we can infer that if the sprocket is not daggled, then it must be cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
