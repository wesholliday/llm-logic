Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 implies that there is a possibility that the flugel is not zargled. It does not confirm that the flugel is definitely not zargled, but it leaves room for doubt.\n\nStatement 2 presents two options: the flugel is either zargled or blimmed. Since we know from Statement 1 that there is a possibility that the flugel is not zargled, we can infer that there is a possibility that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively conclude that the flugel is blimmed, as there is still a possibility that it is zargled. We can only say that it is possible for the flugel to be blimmed based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
