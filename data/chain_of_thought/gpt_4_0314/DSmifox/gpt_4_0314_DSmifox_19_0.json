The smonk might not be plagged: This means that there is a possibility that the smonk is not plagged, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it is not plagged.\n\n2. Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled: This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two statements must be true - either the smonk is plagged or it is vreebled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information:\n\nSince there is a possibility that the smonk is not plagged (from statement 1), and we know that either the smonk is plagged or it is vreebled (from statement 2), we can infer that if the smonk is not plagged, then it must be vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
