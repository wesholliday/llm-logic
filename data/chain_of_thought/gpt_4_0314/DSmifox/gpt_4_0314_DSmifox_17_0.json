It does not confirm that the flob is definitely not movated, but it leaves room for doubt.\n\n2. \"Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled\" - This statement presents two options: the flob is either movated or skizzled. It is an \"either-or\" situation.\n\nNow, let's try to infer if \"The flob is skizzled\" based on these statements:\n\nSince there is a possibility that the flob is not movated (from statement 1), and we know that if the flob is not movated, it must be skizzled (from statement 2), we can infer that there is a possibility that the flob is skizzled.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively conclude that the flob is skizzled, as there is still a possibility that the flob is movated. The given statements only allow us to say that the flob might be skizzled, not that it definitely is.\n\nAnswer: no",
