The twonk might not be plinked: This means that there is a possibility that the twonk is not plinked, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it is not plinked.\n\n2. Either the twonk must be plinked or it is varnished: This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two statements must be true - either the twonk is plinked or it is varnished.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information:\n\nSince there is a possibility that the twonk is not plinked (from statement 1), and we know that either the twonk must be plinked or it is varnished (from statement 2), we can infer that if the twonk is not plinked, then it must be varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
