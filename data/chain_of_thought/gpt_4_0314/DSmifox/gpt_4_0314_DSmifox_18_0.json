It does not confirm whether the shank is nugged or not.\n\n2. \"Either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked\" - This statement presents two possibilities: the shank is either nugged or plooked. One of these must be true.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements to see if we can infer \"The shank is plooked.\"\n\nSince there is a possibility that the shank is not nugged (from statement 1), and we know that either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked (from statement 2), we can infer that if the shank is not nugged, then it must be plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
