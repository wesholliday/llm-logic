The contrapositive is formed by negating both the antecedent and the consequent and reversing their order.\n\nThe contrapositive of the given statement is: If L (Lucy went to the zoo), then not J (Joe did not go to the park).\n\nWe can see that the contrapositive of the given statement is the same as the statement we want to infer. Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the desired statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
