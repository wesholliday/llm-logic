The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then reversing their order. So, the contrapositive of the given statement would be: If not (not C), then not A. This simplifies to: If C, then not A.\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the statement \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
