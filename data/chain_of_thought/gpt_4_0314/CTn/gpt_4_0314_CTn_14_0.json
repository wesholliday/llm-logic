(A = bear in the cave, B = wolf in the den)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer the following statement:\nIf the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\nThis can be represented as: If B, then not A.\n\nWe can use the contrapositive rule in logic, which states that if a statement (If A, then B) is true, then its contrapositive (If not B, then not A) is also true.\n\nThe contrapositive of the given statement (If A, then not B) would be (If B, then not A), which is the statement we want to infer.\n\nSince the contrapositive is always true if the original statement is true, we can infer the desired statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
