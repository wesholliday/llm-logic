We also know that R is the opposite of Q, and S is the opposite of P. So, if R is true (Kate ate the salad), then Q must be false (Kate did not eat the salad). Since Q is false, we can infer that P must also be false (Ben did not eat pasta), which is the same as S being true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"If Kate ate the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
