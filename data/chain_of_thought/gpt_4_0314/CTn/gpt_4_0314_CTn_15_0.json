The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then reversing their order.\n\nThe contrapositive of the given statement is: If P(Erin), then ~P(Sam).\n\nComparing the contrapositive of the given statement with the statement we want to infer, we can see that they are the same.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
