The given statement is in the form of A \u2192 not B. The statement we need to infer is in the form of B \u2192 not A. This is the contrapositive of the given statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always true if the original statement is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the statement 'If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
