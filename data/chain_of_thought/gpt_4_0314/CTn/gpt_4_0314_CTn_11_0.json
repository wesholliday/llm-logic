(A = cake was chocolate, B = muffins were blueberry)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer the following statement:\nIf the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\nThis can be represented as: If B, then not A.\n\nTo determine if we can infer this, let's look at the contrapositive of the given statement. The contrapositive is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order. \n\nSo, the contrapositive of the given statement is: If not (not B), then not A.\nSimplifying this, we get: If B, then not A.\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the statement we were asked about.\n\nAnswer: yes",
