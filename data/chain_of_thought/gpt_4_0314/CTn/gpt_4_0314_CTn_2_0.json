However, it does not provide any information about what happens when the unicorn is in the forest. It is possible that the griffin is not in the forest when the unicorn is there, but it is also possible that they both are in the forest at the same time.\n\nTherefore, we cannot directly infer the second statement (If U, then not G) from the given statement (If G, then not U).\n\nAnswer: no",
