So, the contrapositive of the given statement would be: If the truck was blue (B), then the car was not red (not A).\nSymbolically, this can be represented as B \u2192 (not A).\n\nAs we can see, the contrapositive of the given statement is exactly the statement we want to infer. Since the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the contrapositive from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
