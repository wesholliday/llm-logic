The given statement tells us that if A is true, then B must be false. The statement we want to infer tells us that if B is true, then A must be false. These two statements are actually the contrapositive of each other, meaning that if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the statement 'If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
