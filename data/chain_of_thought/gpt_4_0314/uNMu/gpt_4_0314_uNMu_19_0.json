In other words, it is possible that the watch is not charging on the dresser.\n\nNow, the question asks if we can infer that the watch might not be charging on the dresser. Since the statement already tells us that there is no necessity for the watch to be charging on the dresser, it is reasonable to infer that the watch might not be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
