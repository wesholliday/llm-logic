In other words, it is possible that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Can we infer that Alex might not have finished the race?\"\n\nSince the statement tells us that there is no certainty that Alex finished the race, it implies that there is a possibility that Alex did not finish the race. Therefore, we can infer that Alex might not have finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
