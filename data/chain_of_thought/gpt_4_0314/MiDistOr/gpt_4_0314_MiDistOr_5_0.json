            "content": "Explanation: The original statement, \"The package might be delivered today or tomorrow,\" implies that there are two possible outcomes for the delivery of the package: either it will be delivered today, or it will be delivered tomorrow. This statement does not specify which day the package will be delivered, only that it could be one of the two days mentioned. The rephrased statement, \"The package might be delivered today or it might be delivered tomorrow,\" conveys the same meaning, as it also presents two possible outcomes for the delivery of the package: either today or tomorrow. Both statements express the same uncertainty about the exact day of delivery, and both present the same two possible days for delivery.\n\nAnswer: yes",
