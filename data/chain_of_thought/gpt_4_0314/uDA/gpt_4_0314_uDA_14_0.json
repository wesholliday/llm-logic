The bear was not in the cave.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the condition \"the bear was in the cave\" is false. However, statement 1 is a conditional statement, and it only tells us what happens if the bear is in the cave. It does not provide any information about what happens when the bear is not in the cave.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer anything about the wolf's location based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
