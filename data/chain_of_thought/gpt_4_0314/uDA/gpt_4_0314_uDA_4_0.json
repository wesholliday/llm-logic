The alien did not visit Mars. (This is the negation of A: not A)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that the robot did not visit Jupiter (not B).\n\nThe given statements form a logical structure called Modus Tollens. In Modus Tollens, if we have a conditional statement (If A, then B) and the negation of the consequent (not B), we can infer the negation of the antecedent (not A). However, in this case, we have the negation of the antecedent (not A) and want to infer the negation of the consequent (not B), which is not valid in Modus Tollens.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the robot did not visit Jupiter based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
