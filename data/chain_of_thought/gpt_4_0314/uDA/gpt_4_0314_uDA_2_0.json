The griffin was not in the forest.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the griffin is present in the forest, then the unicorn must also be present. However, statement 2 tells us that the griffin is not in the forest. This means that the condition for the unicorn being in the forest (i.e., the griffin being in the forest) is not met.\n\nHowever, we do not have any information about the unicorn's presence or absence in the forest when the griffin is not in the forest. Therefore, we cannot infer that the unicorn was not in the forest based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
