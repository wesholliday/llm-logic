Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A (Jeff played basketball), then B (Amy played tennis). However, we are given that A is false (Jeff did not play basketball).\n\nIn this case, we cannot make any definitive conclusion about B (Amy playing tennis) because the conditional statement only tells us what happens if A is true. Amy could have played tennis for other reasons, or she might not have played at all. We simply don't have enough information to determine whether Amy played tennis or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
