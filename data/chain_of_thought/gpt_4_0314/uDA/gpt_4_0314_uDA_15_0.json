The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Sam taking a plane) is true, then the result (Erin taking a train) must also be true. However, the second statement tells us that the condition (Sam taking a plane) is not true.\n\nSince the condition is not true, we cannot make any definitive conclusions about the result (Erin taking a train) based on the given information. Erin may or may not have taken a train.\n\nAnswer: no",
