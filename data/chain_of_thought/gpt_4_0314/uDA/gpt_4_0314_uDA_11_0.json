The cake was not chocolate.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the condition \"the cake was chocolate\" is false. However, statement 1 is a conditional statement, and it only tells us what happens if the cake was chocolate. It does not provide any information about what happens when the cake is not chocolate.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer anything about the muffins based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
