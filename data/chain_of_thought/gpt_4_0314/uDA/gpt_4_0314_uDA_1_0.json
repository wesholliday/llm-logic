If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\nThis statement tells us that if Mary attended the wedding, Sue must have attended as well. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if Mary did not attend the wedding.\n\n2. Mary was not at the wedding.\nThis statement tells us that Mary did not attend the wedding.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that Sue was not at the wedding based on these statements. Since the first statement only tells us what happens if Mary attended the wedding, it does not provide any information about Sue's attendance if Mary did not attend. Therefore, we cannot infer that Sue was not at the wedding based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
