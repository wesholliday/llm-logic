The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (apple being red) is true, then the result (banana being yellow) must also be true. However, the second statement tells us that the apple was not red. \n\nSince the condition (apple being red) is not true, we cannot make any definitive conclusions about the result (banana being yellow) based on the given information. The banana could be yellow or not yellow, but we don't have enough information to determine that.\n\nAnswer: no",
