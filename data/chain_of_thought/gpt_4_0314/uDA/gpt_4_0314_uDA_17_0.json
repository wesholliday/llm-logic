The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Ben eating pasta) is true, then the result (Kate eating salad) must also be true. However, the second statement tells us that the condition (Ben eating pasta) is false.\n\nSince the condition is false, we cannot make any definitive conclusions about the result (Kate eating salad) based on the given information. It is still possible that Kate ate salad, but we cannot infer that she did not eat salad based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
