The book was not written by James.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if James is the author, then the book is a mystery novel. However, the second statement tells us that James is not the author. This means that we cannot use the first statement to determine the genre of the book, since it only applies when James is the author.\n\nSince we don't have any other information about the book's genre, we cannot infer that the book is not a mystery novel. It could still be a mystery novel written by someone else.\n\nAnswer: no",
