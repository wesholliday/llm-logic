Joe did not go to the park. (This is the negation of A: not A)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo (not B).\n\nThe given information tells us that if Joe went to the park, Lucy would definitely go to the zoo. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if Joe does not go to the park. In other words, we don't know if Lucy still goes to the zoo or not when Joe doesn't go to the park.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
