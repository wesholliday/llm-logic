The shirt was not cotton.\n\nWe are asked if we can infer that the pants were not denim.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (shirt being cotton) is true, then the result (pants being denim) must also be true. However, the second statement tells us that the condition (shirt being cotton) is false.\n\nIn this case, we cannot make any definitive conclusion about the pants being denim or not, because the conditional statement only tells us what happens when the shirt is cotton. Since the shirt is not cotton, we don't have enough information to determine the pants' material.\n\nAnswer: no",
