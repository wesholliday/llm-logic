The vampire was not awake.\n\nWe are asked to determine if we can infer that the mummy was not awake.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A (vampire awake), then B (mummy awake). The second statement tells us that A is false (vampire not awake).\n\nHowever, the conditional statement does not provide information about what happens when A is false. In other words, we don't know if the mummy is awake or not when the vampire is not awake. Therefore, we cannot infer that the mummy was not awake based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
