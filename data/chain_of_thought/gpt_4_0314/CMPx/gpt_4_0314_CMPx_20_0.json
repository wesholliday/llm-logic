    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trundle, a foopet, and a crangor are likely to be the top selling whippits. The trundle will likely be #1 in sales, followed closely by the foopet, with the crangor having significantly lower expected sales. These lead whippit sales, so if the foopet isn\u2019t the top seller, then if the trundle isn\u2019t, the crangor will be. Moreover, the trundle likely will lead sales and hence the foopet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trundle isn\u2019t the top selling whippit, the crangor will be?",

The trundle is likely to be #1 in sales, followed closely by the foopet, and the crangor has significantly lower expected sales.\n3. If the foopet isn\u2019t the top seller, then if the trundle isn\u2019t, the crangor will be.\n4. The trundle likely will lead sales and hence the foopet likely won\u2019t.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trundle isn\u2019t the top selling whippit, the crangor will be?\n\nBased on the information given, we know that the trundle is likely to be the top seller, and if it isn't, the foopet is the next likely candidate. However, we also know that if the foopet isn't the top seller, then the crangor will be. Since the trundle is likely to lead sales, the foopet likely won't be the top seller. Therefore, if the trundle isn't the top selling whippit, it's likely that the crangor will be.\n\nAnswer: yes",
