    "user_prompt": "Suppose a fantole, a dribban, and a snorpul have the best odds to win this season's Rizzle Cup. Oddsmakers believe it's most probable the fantole will capture the cup, followed by the dribban, while the snorpul is a heavy longshot. Since these are the only top contenders, if the dribban doesn\u2019t win the cup, then if the fantole doesn\u2019t win, the snorpul will win. Moreover, the fantole likely will win the cup and hence the dribban likely won't win. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantole doesn't win the Rizzle Cup, the snorpul will?",

If the dribban doesn't win and the fantole doesn't win, then the snorpul will win.\n3. The fantole is likely to win, so the dribban is likely not to win.\n\nNow, we are asked if it's likely that, if the fantole doesn't win, the snorpul will win.\n\nGiven that the fantole is likely to win, the scenario where the fantole doesn't win is less probable. However, in that less probable scenario, if the dribban also doesn't win, then the snorpul will win. Since the dribban is likely not to win, in the less probable scenario where the fantole doesn't win, it becomes more likely that the snorpul will win.\n\nAnswer: yes",
