    "user_prompt": "Suppose a flinker, a dringen, and a n\u00fcffen have the best projections to have a breakout season next year. Talent scouts believe it's highly probable the flinker will have a breakout season, followed closely by the dringen, while the n\u00fcffen is an outside shot. Since these are the only top prospects, if the dringen doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season. Moreover, scouts think the flinker will likely have a breakout season and hence the dringen likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Flinker has the highest probability of a breakout season.\n2. Dringen has the second-highest probability of a breakout season.\n3. N\u00fcffen has the lowest probability of a breakout season.\n4. If the dringen doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season.\n5. Scouts think the flinker will likely have a breakout season, and hence the dringen likely won't.\n\nWe are asked if it's likely that, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will.\n\nFrom point 4, we know that if both the flinker and dringen don't have breakout seasons, then the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season. However, from point 5, we know that it's likely that the flinker will have a breakout season. So, the condition \"if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season\" is not likely to happen.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that it's likely that, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will.\n\nAnswer: no",
