    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a dribbet, a vrendel, and a toffen lead this quarter\u2019s gadston sales. Market analysts expect the dribbet likely will retain the top sales spot, followed by the vrendel, with gadston sales for the toffen significantly lower. These dominate the gadston market currently, so if the vrendel isn\u2019t #1 in sales, then if the dribbet isn\u2019t #1, the toffen will be #1. Moreover, the dribbet likely will lead gadston sales this quarter and hence the vrendel likely won\u2019t lead sales. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the dribbet isn\u2019t #1 in gadston sales this quarter, the toffen will be #1?",

If vrendel isn't #1 and dribbet isn't #1, then toffen will be #1.\n4. Dribbet is likely to lead sales, so vrendel likely won't lead sales.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: If the dribbet isn't #1 in gadston sales this quarter, is it likely that the toffen will be #1?\n\nSince we know that if vrendel isn't #1 and dribbet isn't #1, then toffen will be #1 (from point 3). We also know that vrendel likely won't lead sales (from point 4). So, if the dribbet isn't #1, it's likely that the toffen will be #1, given the information provided.\n\nAnswer: yes",
