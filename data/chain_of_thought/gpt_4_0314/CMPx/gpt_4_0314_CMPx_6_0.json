    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jentil, a lomfry, and a darsal are the leading gardam suppliers this quarter. Industry analysts expect the jentil likely will sell the most gardam, followed by the lomfry, with the darsal significantly lower. These dominate gardam sales, so if the lomfry doesn\u2019t sell the most gardam, then if the jentil doesn\u2019t, the darsal will. Moreover, the jentil likely will lead gardam sales and hence the lomfry likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the jentil doesn\u2019t lead gardam sales, the darsal will?",

If neither jentil nor lomfry sells the most gardam, then darsal will.\n4. Jentil is likely to lead gardam sales, so lomfry likely won't.\n\nNow, we need to determine if it's likely that, if the jentil doesn't lead gardam sales, the darsal will.\n\nIf the jentil doesn't lead gardam sales, then the lomfry and darsal are the remaining contenders. Since the lomfry likely won't lead gardam sales (according to point 4), it becomes more likely that the darsal will lead gardam sales in this scenario.\n\nAnswer: yes",
