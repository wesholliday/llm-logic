    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a vringlet, a crappen, and a strorvil are shortlisted for the Liggerton Award in bloffu this year. Bloffu critics regard the vringlet as the front runner, followed by the crappen, while the strorvil is a heavy underdog. Since these are the only finalists under consideration, if the crappen doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the vringlet doesn\u2019t win, the strorvil will win. Moreover, the vringlet likely will win the award and hence the crappen likely won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the vringlet doesn\u2019t win the Liggerton Award, the strorvil will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. There are three finalists: vringlet, crappen, and strorvil.\n2. The ranking is as follows: vringlet > crappen > strorvil.\n3. If the crappen doesn't win, and the vringlet doesn't win, then the strorvil will win (since these are the only finalists).\n4. The vringlet is likely to win, so the crappen is likely not to win.\n\nNow, we are asked if it is likely that, if the vringlet doesn't win, the strorvil will win.\n\nSince the vringlet is likely to win, the scenario where the vringlet doesn't win is less likely. However, in that less likely scenario, if the crappen also doesn't win (which is likely), then the strorvil will win by default. So, in the less likely scenario where the vringlet doesn't win, it is likely that the strorvil will win.\n\nAnswer: yes",
