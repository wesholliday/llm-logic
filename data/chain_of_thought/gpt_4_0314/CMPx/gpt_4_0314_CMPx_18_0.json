    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a blimfet, a crongle, and a narzil are the leading bafwidgers. Experts expect the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most this year, followed by the crongle, with the narzil bafwidging much less. These are the only major bafwidgers, so if the crongle doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, then if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will bafwidge the most. Moreover, the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most, and hence the crongle likely won\u2019t bafwidge the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Blimfet, crongle, and narzil are the leading bafwidgers.\n2. Experts expect the ranking of bafwidging to be: blimfet > crongle > narzil.\n3. If the crongle doesn't bafwidge the most, and if the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, then the narzil will bafwidge the most.\n4. The blimfet is likely to bafwidge the most, so the crongle likely won't bafwidge the most.\n\nNow, we are asked if it's likely that, if the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, the narzil will.\n\nGiven the information, we know that if the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, then the only other option for the top bafwidger is the crongle or the narzil. Since the crongle likely won't bafwidge the most, it's reasonable to assume that, in this scenario, the narzil will bafwidge the most.\n\nAnswer: yes",
