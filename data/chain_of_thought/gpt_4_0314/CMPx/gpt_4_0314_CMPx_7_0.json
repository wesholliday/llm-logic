    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crastin, a nivet, and a jomial are the top bispets this breeding season. Breeders expect the crastin likely will birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, with the jomial birthing many fewer. These lead in birthing, so if the nivet doesn\u2019t birth the most offspring, then if the crastin doesn\u2019t, the jomial will. Moreover, the crastin likely will lead births and hence the nivet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the crastin doesn\u2019t lead births, the jomial will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Crastin, nivet, and jomial are the top bispets this breeding season.\n2. Breeders expect the following order in terms of offspring: crastin > nivet > jomial.\n3. If the nivet doesn't birth the most offspring, then if the crastin doesn't, the jomial will.\n4. The crastin likely will lead births, and hence the nivet likely won't.\n\nNow, we need to determine if it's likely that, if the crastin doesn't lead births, the jomial will.\n\nFrom point 4, we know that it's likely that the crastin will lead births. However, we are considering the scenario where the crastin doesn't lead births. In this case, we can refer to point 3, which states that if the nivet doesn't birth the most offspring and the crastin doesn't, then the jomial will.\n\nSince the crastin likely will lead births, it's unlikely that the crastin doesn't lead births. But if we assume that the crastin doesn't lead births, then it's likely that the jomial will, as stated in point 3.\n\nAnswer: yes",
