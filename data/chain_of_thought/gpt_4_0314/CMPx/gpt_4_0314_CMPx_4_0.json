    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crinel, a nafiz, and a tomul are competing to be snarggle of next year's laggle team. The crinel is considered the frontrunner for snarggle, followed by the nafiz, while the tomul is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates, if the nafiz isn\u2019t named snarggle, then if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle. Moreover, the crinel likely will be named snarggle and hence the nafiz likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. There are three candidates: crinel, nafiz, and tomul.\n2. The crinel is the frontrunner, followed by the nafiz, and the tomul is a long shot.\n3. If the nafiz isn't named snarggle, and the crinel isn't named snarggle, then the tomul will be named snarggle.\n4. The crinel is likely to be named snarggle, and hence the nafiz likely won't be.\n\nNow, we are asked if it is likely that, if the crinel isn't named snarggle, the tomul will be.\n\nSince the crinel is the frontrunner and likely to be named snarggle, the probability of the crinel not being named snarggle is low. However, if this low probability event occurs, then the nafiz also isn't named snarggle (as stated in point 4). In this case, the tomul will be named snarggle, as stated in point 3.\n\nSo, given the low probability event of the crinel not being named snarggle, it is likely that the tomul will be named snarggle.\n\nAnswer: yes",
