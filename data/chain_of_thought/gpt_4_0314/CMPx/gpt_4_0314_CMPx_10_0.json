    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantole, a dribban, and a cruggit are the most downloaded fillip apps this month. Market watchers expect the fantole likely will retain the top spot in downloads, followed by the dribban, with the cruggit download rate significantly lower. These lead the downloads, so if the dribban isn\u2019t the most downloaded, then if the fantole isn\u2019t, the cruggit will be. Moreover, the fantole likely will lead downloads and hence the dribban likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fantole isn\u2019t the most downloaded, the cruggit will be?",

Market watchers expect the following order: fantole > dribban > cruggit.\n3. If dribban isn\u2019t the most downloaded, then if fantole isn\u2019t, the cruggit will be.\n4. Fantole likely will lead downloads, and hence dribban likely won\u2019t.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fantole isn\u2019t the most downloaded, the cruggit will be?\n\nBased on the information given, we know that if the fantole isn't the most downloaded, then the cruggit will be the most downloaded only if the dribban isn't the most downloaded as well. Since it's likely that the fantole will lead downloads and the dribban likely won't, it's reasonable to assume that if the fantole isn't the most downloaded, the cruggit will be.\n\nAnswer: yes",
