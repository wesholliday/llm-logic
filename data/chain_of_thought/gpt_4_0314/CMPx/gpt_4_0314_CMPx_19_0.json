    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a garplex, a beelhet, and a peedonk are competing to be domer of the year. Experts think the garplex is most likely to win, followed closely by the beelhet, with the peedonk having a much lower chance. Since these are the only domer candidates, if the beelhet doesn\u2019t become domer, then if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will become domer. Moreover, it is likely the garplex will become domer and hence the beelhet likely won\u2019t become domer. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will?",

If the beelhet doesn't become domer, and the garplex doesn't become domer, then the peedonk will become domer (since these are the only candidates).\n3. It is likely the garplex will become domer, and hence the beelhet likely won't become domer.\n\nNow, we are asked if it's likely that, if the garplex doesn't become domer, the peedonk will.\n\nGiven that the garplex is most likely to win and the beelhet is less likely to win, if the garplex doesn't become domer, it means that the beelhet has a higher chance of becoming domer than the peedonk. Since the beelhet is more likely to win than the peedonk in this scenario, it is not likely that the peedonk will become domer if the garplex doesn't become domer.\n\nAnswer: no",
