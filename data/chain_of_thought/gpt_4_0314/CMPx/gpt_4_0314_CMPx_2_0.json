    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect are applying for one open zulision. The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

If the cramen doesn't get the zulision, and the jantiz doesn't either, then the sulect will get it.\n4. The jantiz is likely to get the zulision, so the cramen likely won't.\n\nNow, we need to determine if it's likely that, if the jantiz doesn't get the zulision, the sulect will.\n\nIf the jantiz doesn't get the zulision, there are two remaining possibilities: the cramen or the sulect will get it. Since the cramen is more qualified than the sulect, it is more likely that the cramen would get the zulision in this scenario.\n\nAnswer: no",
