    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trenist, a lanken, and a draloid are shortlisted for Drij of the Year. The trenist is considered the front runner, followed by the lanken, while the draloid is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates in contention, if the lanken doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the trenist doesn\u2019t win it, the draloid will win it. Moreover, the trenist likely will win the award and hence the lanken likely won\u2019t win it. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trenist doesn\u2019t win Drij of the Year, the draloid will?",

If L doesn't win and T doesn't win, then D will win.\n4. It is likely that T will win, and hence it is likely that L won't win.\n\nNow, we are asked if it's likely that, if T doesn't win, D will win.\n\nSince it is likely that T will win, the scenario in which T doesn't win is less likely. However, in the less likely scenario where T doesn't win, and given that L likely won't win, it would indeed be the case that D would win. But this is all based on the less likely scenario of T not winning.\n\nAnswer: no",
