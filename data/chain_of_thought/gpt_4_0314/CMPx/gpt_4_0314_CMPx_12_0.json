    "user_prompt": "Suppose a stribben, a vanoon, and a jentapp are applying to rent a bondle. The owner thinks the stribben is the strongest applicant, followed by the vanoon, while the jentapp seems much less qualified to rent a bondle. Since these are the only applicants, if the vanoon isn\u2019t selected, then if the stribben isn\u2019t selected, the jentapp will be selected. Moreover, the stribben likely will be chosen and hence the vanoon likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the stribben isn\u2019t selected to rent the bondle, the jentapp will be?",

If the vanoon isn't selected and the stribben isn't selected, then the jentapp will be selected.\n3. The stribben is likely to be chosen, so the vanoon likely won't be.\n\nNow, we are asked if it's likely that, if the stribben isn't selected, the jentapp will be selected.\n\nSince the stribben is the strongest applicant and likely to be chosen, the scenario where the stribben isn't selected is less likely. However, if that less likely scenario occurs and the stribben isn't selected, then the vanoon is the next strongest applicant. But we know that the vanoon likely won't be selected either. In this case, the jentapp would be the only remaining option.\n\nSo, given the unlikely scenario where the stribben isn't selected, it would be likely that the jentapp would be selected, as the vanoon likely won't be selected either.\n\nAnswer: yes",
