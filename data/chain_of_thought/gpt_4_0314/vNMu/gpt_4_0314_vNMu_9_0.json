In other words, it is possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nConclusion: Lisa might not have bought the red shirt.\nThis statement is saying that it is possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nNow, let's compare the premise and the conclusion. Both statements are essentially saying the same thing - that it is possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Since the conclusion follows directly from the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
