In other words, it is possible that the watch is not charging on the dresser.\n\nConclusion: The watch might not be charging on the dresser.\nThis statement is saying that it is possible that the watch is not charging on the dresser.\n\nNow, let's compare the premise and the conclusion. Both statements are essentially saying the same thing - that it is possible that the watch is not charging on the dresser. Since the conclusion follows directly from the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
