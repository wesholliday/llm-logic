In other words, there is a possibility that someone else wrote the book.\n\nConclusion: The book might not have been written by James.\nThis conclusion states that there is a possibility that James did not write the book.\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion follows logically from the premise:\n\nIf it is not necessary that James wrote the book, then there must be some possibility that he did not write it. This is exactly what the conclusion states. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
