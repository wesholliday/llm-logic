In other words, it is possible that the toy is not in the toy box.\n\nConclusion: The toy might not be in the toy box.\nThis conclusion states that there is a possibility that the toy is not in the toy box.\n\nNow, let's compare the premise and the conclusion. The premise denies the necessity of the toy being in the toy box, while the conclusion asserts the possibility of the toy not being in the toy box. Since the premise directly implies the conclusion, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
