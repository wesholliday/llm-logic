In other words, there is a possibility that the jacket is not draped over the chair.\n\nConclusion: The jacket might not be draped over the chair.\nThis conclusion states that there is a possibility that the jacket is not draped over the chair.\n\nThe conclusion follows directly from the premise, as both statements express the same idea: that there is a possibility that the jacket is not draped over the chair. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
