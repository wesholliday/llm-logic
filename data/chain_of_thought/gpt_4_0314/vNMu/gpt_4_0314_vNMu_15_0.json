In other words, there is a possibility that the shoes are not in the closet.\n\nConclusion: The shoes might not be in the closet.\nThis conclusion states that there is a possibility that the shoes are not in the closet.\n\nThe conclusion follows directly from the premise, as both statements express the same idea: there is a possibility that the shoes are not in the closet. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
