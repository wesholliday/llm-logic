In other words, there is a possibility that the vampire is not awake.\n\nConclusion: The vampire might not have been awake.\nThis conclusion states that there is a possibility that the vampire is not awake.\n\nThe conclusion directly follows from the premise, as both statements express the same idea - that there is a possibility that the vampire is not awake. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
