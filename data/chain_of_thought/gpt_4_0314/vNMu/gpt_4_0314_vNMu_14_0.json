In other words, there is a possibility that the milk is not on the counter.\n\nConclusion: The milk might not be on the counter.\nThis conclusion states that there is a possibility that the milk is not on the counter.\n\nThe conclusion follows directly from the premise, as both statements express the same idea: there is a possibility that the milk is not on the counter. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
