In other words, there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not in her bag.\n\nConclusion: The sunglasses might not be in her bag.\nThis conclusion states that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not in her bag.\n\nNow, let's compare the premise and the conclusion. The premise tells us that it is not necessary for the sunglasses to be in her bag, which implies that there is a possibility that they are not in her bag. The conclusion directly states that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not in her bag.\n\nSince the conclusion follows directly from the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
