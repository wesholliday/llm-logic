In other words, there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nConclusion: Mary might not have been at the wedding.\nThis conclusion states that there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's compare the premise and the conclusion. The premise states that it is not necessary for Mary to be at the wedding, which implies that there is a possibility that she was not there. The conclusion directly states that there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nSince the conclusion follows directly from the premise, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
