In other words, there is a possibility that the scarf is not in the backpack.\n\nConclusion: The scarf might not be stuffed in my backpack.\nThis conclusion states that there is a possibility that the scarf is not in the backpack.\n\nThe conclusion directly follows from the premise, as both statements express the same idea - that there is a possibility that the scarf is not in the backpack.
