In other words, there is a possibility that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nConclusion: Alex might not have finished the race.\nThis conclusion states that there is a possibility that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nNow, let's compare the premise and the conclusion. The premise denies the necessity of Alex finishing the race, while the conclusion affirms the possibility of Alex not finishing the race. Since the premise directly implies the conclusion, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
