In other words, there is a possibility that the pen is not in the bag.\n\nConclusion: The pen might not be in my bag.\nThis conclusion states that there is a possibility that the pen is not in the bag.\n\nThe conclusion directly follows from the premise, as both statements express the same idea - that there is a possibility that the pen is not in the bag. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
