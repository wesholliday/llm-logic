In other words, it is possible that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nConclusion: The griffin might not have been in the forest.\nThis statement also implies that it is possible that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical validity of the argument. An argument is logically valid if the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. In this case, the premise states that there is no necessity for the griffin to be in the forest, and the conclusion states that it is possible that the griffin was not in the forest. The truth of the premise does guarantee the truth of the conclusion, as both statements express the same idea.\n\nAnswer: yes",
