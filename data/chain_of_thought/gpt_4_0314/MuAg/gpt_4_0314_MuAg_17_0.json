This means that there are two conditions that need to be met: the report's accuracy and its submission by noon. The rephrased statement says that the report must have been accurate and been submitted by noon, which also implies that the same two conditions need to be met. Therefore, the meaning of both statements is the same, and we can infer the rephrased statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
