This means that both conditions (eight characters long and including a number) are necessary for the password. The rephrased statement says that the password must have been eight characters long and included a number, which also implies that both conditions are necessary. Since both statements convey the same meaning, we can infer the rephrased statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
