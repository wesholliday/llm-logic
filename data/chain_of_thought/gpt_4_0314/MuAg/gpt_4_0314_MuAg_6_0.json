This means that both conditions are true: the concert was sold out, and it started at 8 PM. The second statement says that the concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM, which is essentially the same as the first statement, just with a slightly different wording. Both statements convey the same information: the concert was sold out and it started at 8 PM.\n\nAnswer: yes",
