This means that the contract had two conditions: 1) it was valid for a year, and 2) it was renewable. The rephrased statement says that the contract must have been valid for a year and been renewable, which also implies the same two conditions. Therefore, the rephrased statement conveys the same meaning as the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
