This means that both conditions (difficulty and coverage of all chapters) are necessary. The second statement says that the exam must have been difficult and covered all chapters, which also implies that both conditions are met. Since both statements convey the same meaning, we can infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
