This means that both conditions (time and location) must be met for the meeting. The rephrased statement says that the meeting must be at 2 PM and in the conference room, which also implies that both conditions (time and location) must be met for the meeting. Since both statements convey the same meaning, we can infer the rephrased statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
