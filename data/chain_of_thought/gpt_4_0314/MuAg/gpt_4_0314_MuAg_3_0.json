The second statement also has the same two conditions: 1) The car must be in the garage, and 2) it needs repairs. The only difference between the two statements is the use of \"it must need\" in the first statement and \"need\" in the second statement. However, both statements convey the same meaning, which is that the car is in the garage and requires repairs.\n\nAnswer: yes",
