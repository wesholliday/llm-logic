    "user_prompt": "Suppose that pizza, burgers, and tacos are the most frequently ordered takeout foods. According to restaurant data, pizza likely will be the top takeout item ordered, followed by burgers, with tacos ordered much less frequently. These foods lead takeout orders, so if burgers aren\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn\u2019t, tacos will be. Moreover, pizza likely will lead takeout orders and hence burgers likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if pizza isn\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be?",

Pizza is likely the top takeout item, followed by burgers, and tacos are ordered much less frequently.\n3. If burgers aren\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn\u2019t, tacos will be.\n4. Pizza likely will lead takeout orders, and hence burgers likely won\u2019t.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if pizza isn\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be?\n\nFrom point 4, we know that pizza likely will lead takeout orders. So, the scenario where pizza isn't the top takeout item is less likely. However, if we assume that pizza isn't the top takeout item, then according to point 3, tacos will be the top takeout item since burgers likely won't be.\n\nSo, under the assumption that pizza isn't the top takeout item, it is likely that tacos will be the top takeout item.\n\nAnswer: yes",
