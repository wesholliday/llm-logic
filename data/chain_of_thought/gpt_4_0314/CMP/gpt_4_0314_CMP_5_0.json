    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the Democrats, Republicans, and Libertarians are the leading political parties. Based on recent polling, the Democrats likely will gain the most new voters, followed by Republicans, with Libertarians trailing distantly. These are the only major parties, so if Republicans don\u2019t gain the most voters, then if Democrats don\u2019t, Libertarians will. Moreover, Democrats likely will gain the most voters and hence Republicans likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will?",

Libertarians are likely to gain the least new voters.\n4. If Republicans don't gain the most voters, then if Democrats don't, Libertarians will.\n\nWe are asked if it is likely that, if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will.\n\nSince Democrats are likely to gain the most new voters, it is unlikely that they won't gain the most voters. However, if we assume that Democrats don't gain the most voters, then according to point 4, Libertarians will gain the most voters if Republicans also don't.\n\nBut, given that Republicans are likely to gain the second most new voters, it is also unlikely that Libertarians will gain more voters than Republicans.\n\nSo, even if Democrats don't gain the most voters, it is still unlikely that Libertarians will gain more voters than Republicans.\n\nAnswer: no",
