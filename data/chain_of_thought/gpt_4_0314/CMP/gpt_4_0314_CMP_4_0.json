    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it\u2019s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn\u2019t get the offer, then if Priya doesn\u2019t, Diego will. Moreover, it\u2019s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn\u2019t get the offer, Diego will?",

The hiring manager thinks it's most likely that Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot.\n3. If Julian doesn't get the offer, then if Priya doesn't, Diego will.\n4. It's likely that Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won't.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn\u2019t get the offer, Diego will?\n\nWe know that if Julian doesn't get the offer and Priya doesn't get the offer, then Diego will get the offer. We also know that it's likely that Priya will get the offer, which means it's likely that Julian won't. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that it's likely that Diego will get the offer if Priya doesn't. The likelihood of Diego getting the offer depends on the probability of both Priya and Julian not getting the offer, which is not explicitly stated.\n\nAnswer: no",
