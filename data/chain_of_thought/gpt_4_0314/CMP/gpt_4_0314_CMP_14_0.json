    "user_prompt": "Suppose that increases to minimum wage, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness are the most likely new laws. Only one new law will be passed this session. Congress watchers expect a minimum wage hike is most probable, followed by paid family leave, with loan forgiveness being much less likely. These are the only likely new laws, so if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen. Moreover, a minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen. Does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?",

The most likely new laws are, in order: minimum wage hike, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness.\n3. If paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen.\n4. A minimum wage hike likely will happen, and hence paid leave likely won't happen.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: Does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?\n\nSince we know that only one new law will be passed and the minimum wage hike is the most likely, if it doesn't happen, we are left with two options: paid family leave and student loan forgiveness. However, we also know that paid leave likely won't happen. So, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, the only remaining option is student loan forgiveness.\n\nAnswer: yes",
