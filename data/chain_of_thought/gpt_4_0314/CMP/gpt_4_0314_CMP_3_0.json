    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Spain, Brazil, and England have the best chances to win the World Cup. Based on betting odds, it is most likely Spain will win, followed closely by Brazil, with England having much lower odds. These teams have the only realistic chances, so if Brazil doesn\u2019t win, then if Spain doesn\u2019t win, England will win. Moreover, it is likely Spain will win and hence that Brazil won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Spain doesn\u2019t win, England will?",

Spain is most likely to win, followed by Brazil, and then England.\n3. If Brazil doesn't win and Spain doesn't win, then England will win.\n4. It is likely that Spain will win, and hence, Brazil won't win.\n\nNow, we are asked if it is likely that, if Spain doesn't win, England will win.\n\nSince Spain is the most likely to win, it is less likely that Spain doesn't win. However, if Spain doesn't win, we know that either Brazil or England will win. Given that Brazil has a higher chance of winning than England, it is more likely that Brazil will win in the scenario where Spain doesn't win.\n\nAnswer: no",
