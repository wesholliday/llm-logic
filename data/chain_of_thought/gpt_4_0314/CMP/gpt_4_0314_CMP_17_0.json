    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the flu, common cold, and strep throat are the most prevalent illnesses this season. Doctors expect the flu likely will infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, with strep infections lagging behind. These are the only major illnesses spreading, so if colds don\u2019t infect the most people, then if flu doesn\u2019t, strep will. Moreover, flu likely will infect the most and hence colds likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if flu doesn\u2019t infect the most, strep will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Flu, common cold, and strep throat are the most prevalent illnesses this season.\n2. The expected order of infections is: flu > common cold > strep throat.\n3. If colds don't infect the most people, then if flu doesn't, strep will.\n4. Flu is likely to infect the most people, so colds likely won't.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if flu doesn\u2019t infect the most, strep will?\n\nGiven that flu is likely to infect the most people, we can assume that it's less likely for flu not to infect the most people. However, if flu doesn't infect the most people, then according to point 3, strep will. Since the likelihood of flu not infecting the most people is low, the likelihood of the condition \"if flu doesn\u2019t infect the most\" being true is also low. But if that condition is true, then it's certain that strep will infect the most people.\n\nSo, while the likelihood of the condition being true is low, if it is true, then it's certain that strep will infect the most people.\n\nAnswer: yes",
