    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the stock market, real estate market, and bond market are the primary investment vehicles. According to financial advisors, the stock market likely will see the highest returns this year, followed by real estate, with bonds having significantly lower expected returns. These markets offer the best investment options, so if real estate doesn\u2019t have the highest returns, then if stocks don\u2019t, bonds will. Moreover, stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if stocks don\u2019t have the highest returns, bonds will?",

The stock market likely will see the highest returns this year, followed by real estate, with bonds having significantly lower expected returns.\n2. If real estate doesn\u2019t have the highest returns, then if stocks don\u2019t, bonds will.\n3. Stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won\u2019t.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if stocks don\u2019t have the highest returns, bonds will?\n\nAccording to point 1, stocks are likely to have the highest returns, followed by real estate, and then bonds. Point 3 also states that stocks likely will have the highest returns, and real estate likely won't.\n\nThe question asks if it's likely that, if stocks don't have the highest returns, bonds will. However, based on the information given, real estate is the second most likely to have the highest returns, not bonds. So, it does not follow that it's likely that if stocks don't have the highest returns, bonds will.\n\nAnswer: no",
