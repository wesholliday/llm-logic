    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Ford, Toyota, and Honda lead US auto sales. Industry analysis expects Ford will sell the most vehicles this year, followed closely by Toyota, with Honda lagging significantly behind. These brands lead the market, so if Toyota isn\u2019t #1 in sales, then if Ford isn\u2019t, Honda will be. Moreover, Ford likely will lead in sales and hence Toyota likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Ford doesn\u2019t lead in sales, Honda will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Ford, Toyota, and Honda lead US auto sales.\n2. Industry analysis expects Ford to sell the most vehicles this year, followed closely by Toyota, with Honda lagging significantly behind.\n3. If Toyota isn\u2019t #1 in sales, then if Ford isn\u2019t, Honda will be.\n4. Ford likely will lead in sales and hence Toyota likely won\u2019t.\n\nNow, we are asked if it is likely that, if Ford doesn\u2019t lead in sales, Honda will. \n\nGiven the information, we know that Ford is expected to lead in sales, and if Ford doesn't, then Toyota or Honda will be #1. Since Toyota is expected to be close to Ford in sales, it is more likely that Toyota would take the #1 spot if Ford doesn't lead in sales. However, the question asks if it is likely that Honda will lead in sales if Ford doesn't. \n\nSince Honda is lagging significantly behind Ford and Toyota, it is less likely that Honda would take the #1 spot if Ford doesn't lead in sales. Therefore, it does not follow that it is likely that, if Ford doesn\u2019t lead in sales, Honda will.\n\nAnswer: no",
