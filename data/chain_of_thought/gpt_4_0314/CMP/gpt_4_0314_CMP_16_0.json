    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the main transportation options in a city. According to ridership data, Uber likely will have the most rides this month, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer rides. These are the only major transportation providers, so if Lyft doesn\u2019t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn\u2019t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides. Moreover, Uber likely will give the most rides and hence Lyft likely won\u2019t give the most rides. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Uber doesn\u2019t give the most rides, taxis will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Uber is likely to have the most rides this month.\n2. Lyft is likely to have the second most rides this month.\n3. Taxis are likely to have significantly fewer rides than Uber and Lyft.\n4. If Lyft doesn't give the most rides and Uber doesn't give the most rides, then taxis will give the most rides.\n\nNow, we are asked if it's likely that, if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will. Since we know that Uber is likely to have the most rides, and Lyft is likely to have the second most rides, it's unlikely that taxis will have the most rides. However, the question is asking about the scenario where Uber doesn't give the most rides.\n\nIn the scenario where Uber doesn't give the most rides, we know that Lyft is the next likely candidate to have the most rides. But the information given states that if Lyft doesn't give the most rides and Uber doesn't give the most rides, then taxis will give the most rides. Since Uber is not giving the most rides in this scenario, and Lyft likely won't give the most rides (as stated in the information), it follows that it's likely that taxis will give the most rides in this specific scenario.\n\nAnswer: yes",
