    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, and Beyonce have the top-selling albums this year. Industry experts project it's likely Taylor Swift's album will sell the most copies, followed closely by Bad Bunny's, with Beyonce's album far behind. These are the only top-sellers, so if Bad Bunny\u2019s album doesn\u2019t sell the most copies, then if Taylor Swift\u2019s doesn\u2019t, Beyonce\u2019s will. Moreover, Taylor Swift\u2019s likely will sell the most and hence Bad Bunny's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, and Beyonce have the top-selling albums this year.\n2. It's likely that Taylor Swift's album will sell the most copies, followed closely by Bad Bunny's, with Beyonce's album far behind.\n3. If Bad Bunny's album doesn't sell the most copies, then if Taylor Swift's doesn't, Beyonce's will.\n4. Taylor Swift's album is likely to sell the most, and hence Bad Bunny's likely won't.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: Does it follow that it's likely that, if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will?\n\nFrom point 4, we know that it's likely that Taylor Swift's album will sell the most copies. If Taylor Swift's album doesn't sell the most copies, then we have two remaining possibilities: Bad Bunny's or Beyonce's album will sell the most copies.\n\nFrom point 3, we know that if Bad Bunny's album doesn't sell the most copies and Taylor Swift's doesn't either, then Beyonce's will. Since it's likely that Taylor Swift's album will sell the most copies (point 4), it's unlikely that we will reach the situation where both Taylor Swift's and Bad Bunny's albums don't sell the most copies. Therefore, it's unlikely that, if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will.\n\nAnswer: no",
