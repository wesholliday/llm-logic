    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower.\n3. If Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will.\n4. Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will?\n\nFrom point 4, we know that Tennessee likely will add the most jobs. However, the question asks us to consider the scenario where Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs. In this case, we can refer to point 3, which states that if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will.\n\nSince we are assuming that Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, and we know from point 4 that Georgia likely won't add the most jobs, it follows that Missouri will add the most jobs in this scenario.\n\nAnswer: yes",
