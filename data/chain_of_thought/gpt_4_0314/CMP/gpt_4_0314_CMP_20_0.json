    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",

Coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings.\n3. If tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n4. Coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?\n\nSince coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers (point 2), the scenario where coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers is less likely. However, if that less likely scenario occurs, and tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers either (point 4), then soda will retain the most morning drinkers (point 3).\n\nAnswer: yes",
