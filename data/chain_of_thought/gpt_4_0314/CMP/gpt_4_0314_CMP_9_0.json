    "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it\u2019s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be. Moreover, it\u2019s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits.\n2. It's likely that apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind.\n3. If bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be.\n4. It\u2019s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won\u2019t be.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?\n\nFrom point 2, we know that it's likely that apples will be the top-selling fruit. However, the question asks us to consider the scenario where apples aren't the top-selling fruit. In this case, we need to look at point 3, which states that if bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be.\n\nSince point 4 states that it's likely that apples will be the top seller and hence bananas won't be, we can conclude that if apples aren't the top-selling fruit, it's likely that oranges will be the top-selling fruit.\n\nAnswer: yes",
