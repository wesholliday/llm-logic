    "user_prompt": "Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don\u2019t increase the most, then if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won\u2019t increase the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year.\n2. The expected order of increase is: rents > home prices > mortgage rates.\n3. If home prices don't increase the most, and rents don't increase the most, then mortgage rates will increase the most.\n4. Rents likely will increase the most, so home prices likely won't increase the most.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: Does it follow that it's likely that, if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?\n\nGiven that rents are likely to increase the most, if rents don't increase the most, it would be an unexpected outcome. However, we know from point 3 that if both home prices and rents don't increase the most, then mortgage rates will increase the most. Since we already know that home prices likely won't increase the most (point 4), if rents don't increase the most in this unexpected scenario, then it would follow that mortgage rates will increase the most.\n\nAnswer: yes",
