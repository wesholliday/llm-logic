    "user_prompt": "Suppose that India, China, and Russia are the world's leading emerging economies. Economists project it's likely India's economy will grow the fastest this year, followed closely by China's, with Russia's growth rate lagging distantly behind. These are by far the biggest emerging economies, so if China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn\u2019t, Russia will be. Moreover, India's economy likely will grow the fastest of these three and hence China's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if India isn\u2019t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be?",

Economists project India's economy will grow the fastest this year, followed closely by China's, with Russia's growth rate lagging distantly behind.\n3. If China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn\u2019t, Russia will be.\n4. India's economy likely will grow the fastest of these three, and hence China's likely won't.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: Does it follow that it's likely that, if India isn\u2019t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be?\n\nFrom point 4, we know that it's likely that India's economy will grow the fastest, and China's likely won't. This means that it's unlikely that India isn't the top-growing emerging economy. However, the question asks us to consider the scenario where India isn't the top-growing emerging economy.\n\nIn this scenario, we can refer to point 3, which states that if China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn\u2019t, Russia will be. Since we already know from point 4 that China's economy likely won't grow the fastest, we can conclude that if India isn't the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be.\n\nAnswer: yes",
