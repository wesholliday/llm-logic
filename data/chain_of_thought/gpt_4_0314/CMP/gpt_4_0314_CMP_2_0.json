    "user_prompt": "Suppose that banana bread, chocolate chip cookies, and carrot cake are the most popular baked goods. According to a consumer survey, it is very likely that banana bread will be the top seller, followed closely by chocolate chip cookies, with carrot cake far behind. These are the only top sellers, so if chocolate chip cookies aren\u2019t the top seller, then if banana bread isn\u2019t, carrot cake will be. Moreover, it is likely banana bread will be top and hence that chocolate chip cookies won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if banana bread isn\u2019t the top seller, carrot cake will be?",

It is very likely that banana bread will be the top seller, followed closely by chocolate chip cookies, with carrot cake far behind.\n3. If chocolate chip cookies aren\u2019t the top seller, then if banana bread isn\u2019t, carrot cake will be.\n4. It is likely that banana bread will be the top seller and hence that chocolate chip cookies won\u2019t be.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: Does it follow that it is likely that, if banana bread isn\u2019t the top seller, carrot cake will be?\n\nFrom point 2, we know that it is very likely that banana bread will be the top seller. From point 4, we know that it is likely that chocolate chip cookies won\u2019t be the top seller. So, if banana bread isn't the top seller (which is unlikely), then according to point 3, carrot cake will be the top seller.\n\nHowever, the question asks if it is likely that, if banana bread isn\u2019t the top seller, carrot cake will be. Since it is very likely that banana bread will be the top seller, the scenario where banana bread isn't the top seller is unlikely. Therefore, it is not likely that, if banana bread isn\u2019t the top seller, carrot cake will be.\n\nAnswer: no",
