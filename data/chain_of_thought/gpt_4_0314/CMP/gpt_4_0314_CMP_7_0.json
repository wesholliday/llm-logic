    "user_prompt": "Suppose that tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources. Forecasts indicate it\u2019s likely tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. These are the only major sources, so if solar power doesn\u2019t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn\u2019t, wind power will. Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?",

Forecasts indicate that tidal power will likely generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind.\n3. If solar power doesn\u2019t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn\u2019t, wind power will.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question:\n\nDoes it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?\n\nWe know that tidal power is likely to generate the most electricity. If tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, then either solar power or wind power will. However, we also know that solar power is more likely to generate more electricity than wind power. So, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, it's more likely that solar power will, rather than wind power.\n\nAnswer: no",
