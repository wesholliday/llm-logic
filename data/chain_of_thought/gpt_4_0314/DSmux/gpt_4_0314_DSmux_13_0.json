It's not the case that the glip must be tragged.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two parts must be true: either the glip is slogged, or it must be tragged.\n\nStatement 2 negates the second part of the disjunction, meaning that it is not true that the glip must be tragged.\n\nSince we know that at least one part of the disjunction must be true, and we know that the second part is not true, we can infer that the first part must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
