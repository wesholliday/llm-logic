It's not the case that the wug must be garpled.\n\nWe can represent these statements using logical notation:\n\n1. S \u2228 G (S for sproinged, G for garpled)\n2. \u00acG (\u00ac for negation)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The wug is sproinged' (S) from these statements.\n\nUsing the disjunction elimination rule, if we know that one of the disjuncts (S or G) is false, we can infer the other disjunct is true. In this case, we know that \u00acG is true, which means G is false. Since G is false, we can infer that S (the wug is sproinged) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
