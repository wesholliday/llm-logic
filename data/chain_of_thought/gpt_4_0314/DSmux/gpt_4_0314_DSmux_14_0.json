Either the clug is fleeked or it must be snugged.\nThis statement is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the clug is fleeked, or it must be snugged.\n\n2. It's not the case that the clug must be snugged.\nThis statement is a negation, meaning that the condition \"the clug must be snugged\" is false.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\nSince the first statement tells us that at least one of the conditions must be true, and the second statement tells us that the condition \"the clug must be snugged\" is false, we can infer that the other condition, \"the clug is fleeked,\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
