It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two parts must be true: either the whiffle is shanked, or it must be tinked.\n\nStatement 2 negates the second part of the disjunction, saying that it's not true that the whiffle must be tinked.\n\nSince we know that at least one part of the disjunction must be true, and we know that the second part is not true, we can infer that the first part must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
