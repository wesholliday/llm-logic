It's not the case that the splat must be quanked.\n\nIn the first statement, we have two possibilities: the splat is morphed (A) or it must be quanked (B). This can be represented as A \u2228 B.\n\nIn the second statement, we are told that the splat must not be quanked. This means that B is false, or \u00acB.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that the splat is morphed (A) from these two statements.\n\nUsing the disjunction elimination rule, if we have A \u2228 B and \u00acB, we can infer A.\n\nSince we have A \u2228 B (from statement 1) and \u00acB (from statement 2), we can infer A, which means the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
