It's not the case that the wug must be bimmed.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the wug is flooped, or it must be bimmed.\n\nStatement 2 negates the second condition of Statement 1, which means that the wug does not have to be bimmed.\n\nSince we know that at least one of the conditions in Statement 1 must be true, and we know that the second condition is false (from Statement 2), we can infer that the first condition must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
