Either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the dreb is vroombed (A) or it must be spened (B). So, we have A or B.\n\n2. It's not the case that the dreb must be spened.\nThis statement negates the second possibility from the first statement, meaning it's not true that the dreb must be spened. So, we have \u00acB.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The dreb is vroombed' (A) from these two statements.\n\nSince we have A or B, and we know \u00acB is true, we can infer that A must be true because one of the possibilities in the first statement must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
