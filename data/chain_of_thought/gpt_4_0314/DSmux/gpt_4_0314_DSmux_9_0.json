It's not the case that the twonk must be plinked.\n\nWe can represent these statements using logical notation:\n\n1. V \u2228 P (where V represents \"the twonk is varnished\" and P represents \"the twonk must be plinked\")\n2. \u00acP (where \u00ac represents negation)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"The twonk is varnished\" (V) from these statements. Using the rules of logical inference, we can apply the Disjunctive Syllogism rule, which states that if we have a disjunction (V \u2228 P) and the negation of one of the disjuncts (\u00acP), we can infer the other disjunct (V).\n\nSince we have both V \u2228 P and \u00acP, we can infer V, which means \"The twonk is varnished.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
