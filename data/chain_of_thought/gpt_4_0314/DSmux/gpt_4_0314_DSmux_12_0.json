It's not the case that the smip must be lupped.\n\nWe can represent these statements using logical notation:\n\n1. S \u2228 L (S for \"smip is shripped\" and L for \"smip must be lupped\")\n2. \u00acL (negation of L)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The smip is shripped' (S) from these statements.\n\nUsing the rules of logical inference, we can apply the Disjunctive Syllogism rule, which states that if we have a disjunction (S \u2228 L) and the negation of one of the disjuncts (\u00acL), we can infer the other disjunct (S).\n\nSo, given the statements:\n\n1. S \u2228 L\n2. \u00acL\n\nWe can infer S (The smip is shripped) using Disjunctive Syllogism.\n\nAnswer: yes",
