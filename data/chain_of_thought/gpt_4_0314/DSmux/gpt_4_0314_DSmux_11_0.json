It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed.\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the flug is blummed, or it must be zimmed. The second statement negates the second condition, saying that it's not true that the flug must be zimmed.\n\nSince the first statement tells us that at least one of the conditions must be true, and the second statement tells us that the second condition is not true, we can infer that the first condition must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
