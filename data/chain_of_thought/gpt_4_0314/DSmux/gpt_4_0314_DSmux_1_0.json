It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two parts must be true: either the flugel is blimmed, or it must be zargled.\n\nStatement 2 negates the second part of the disjunction, meaning that it is not true that the flugel must be zargled.\n\nSince we know that at least one part of the disjunction must be true, and we know that the second part is not true, we can infer that the first part must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
