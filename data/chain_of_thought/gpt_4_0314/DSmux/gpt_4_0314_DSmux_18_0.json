It's not the case that the shank must be nugged.\n\nWe can represent these statements using logical notation:\n\n1. P \u2228 N (P = the shank is plooked, N = the shank must be nugged)\n2. \u00acN\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The shank is plooked' (P) from these statements. Using the rules of logical inference, we can apply the Disjunctive Syllogism rule, which states that if we have P \u2228 N and \u00acN, we can infer P.\n\nSince we have both P \u2228 N and \u00acN, we can infer P.\n\nAnswer: yes",
