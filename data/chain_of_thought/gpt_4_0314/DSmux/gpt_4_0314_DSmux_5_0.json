It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two parts must be true (either the zinger is fraggled or it must be smoogled).\n\nStatement 2 negates the second part of the disjunction (it's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled).\n\nSince the disjunction in Statement 1 must have at least one true part, and we know from Statement 2 that the second part is not true, the only remaining possibility is that the first part is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
