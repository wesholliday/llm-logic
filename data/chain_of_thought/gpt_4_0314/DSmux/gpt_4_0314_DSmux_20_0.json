It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned.\n\nIn the first statement, we have two possibilities: the fleeg is bluttered (A) or it must be surned (B). This can be represented as A \u2228 B.\n\nIn the second statement, we are told that it's not the case that the fleeg must be surned. This means that B is false, which can be represented as \u00acB.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that the fleeg is bluttered (A) from these two statements.\n\nSince we know that \u00acB is true, we can use the disjunction elimination rule on the first statement (A \u2228 B). This rule states that if one of the disjuncts (in this case, B) is false, then the other disjunct (A) must be true.\n\nSo, given that \u00acB is true, we can infer that A (the fleeg is bluttered) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
