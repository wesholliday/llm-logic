It's not the case that the sneg must be sproted.\n\nWe can represent these statements using logical notation:\n\n1. C \u2228 S (where C represents \"the sneg is crampled\" and S represents \"the sneg must be sproted\")\n2. \u00acS (where \u00acS represents \"it's not the case that the sneg must be sproted\")\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The sneg is crampled' (C) from these statements.\n\nUsing the logical notation, we can apply the Disjunctive Syllogism rule, which states that if we have a disjunction (C \u2228 S) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false (\u00acS), then the other disjunct must be true (C).\n\nSo, given the statements:\n\n1. C \u2228 S\n2. \u00acS\n\nWe can infer:\n\nAnswer: yes",
