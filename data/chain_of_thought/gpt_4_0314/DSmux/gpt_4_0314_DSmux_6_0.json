It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped.\n\nWe are asked if we can infer 'The grommet is sploffed' from these statements.\n\nSince statement 1 is an \"either/or\" statement, it means that at least one of the two conditions must be true. In other words, if one condition is false, the other must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the grommet must not be plopped. Since this condition is false, according to statement 1, the other condition (the grommet is sploffed) must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The grommet is sploffed'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
