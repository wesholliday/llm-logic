It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged.\n\nWe can represent these statements using logical notation:\n\n1. V \u2228 P (V for vreebled, P for plagged)\n2. \u00acP (\u00ac for negation)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that the smonk is vreebled (V) from these statements. Since we know that \u00acP is true, we can use the disjunction elimination rule on the first statement:\n\nV \u2228 P\n\u00acP\n-----\nV\n\nSo, based on the given information, we can infer that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
