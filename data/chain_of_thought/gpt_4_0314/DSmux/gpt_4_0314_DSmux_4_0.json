It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked.\n\nWe can represent these statements using logical notation:\n\n1. S \u2228 C (S for snurgled, C for crinked)\n2. \u00acC (not crinked)\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The fribble is snurgled' (S) from these statements.\n\nUsing the disjunction elimination rule, if we have a disjunction (S \u2228 C) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false (\u00acC), then we can infer that the other disjunct must be true (S).\n\nSo, given the statements:\n\n1. S \u2228 C\n2. \u00acC\n\nWe can infer:\n\nAnswer: yes",
