            "content": "Explanation: The original statement says that the plimp might be wozzle by flonk and the fizzle might be fribble gribble. This means that there is a possibility that the plimp is wozzle by flonk and there is a possibility that the fizzle is fribble gribble. The rephrased statement, \"It might be that the plimp is wozzle by flonk and the fizzle is fribble gribble,\" is essentially saying the same thing: there is a possibility that both conditions are true. Since both statements convey the same meaning, we can infer the rephrased statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
