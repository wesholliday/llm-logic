The original statement says that the bimboozle might be flonk and the floob might be a quank. This means that there is a possibility that the bimboozle is flonk and there is a possibility that the floob is a quank. Combining these two possibilities, we can infer that there is a possibility that both the bimboozle is flonk and the floob is a quank.\n\nAnswer: yes",
