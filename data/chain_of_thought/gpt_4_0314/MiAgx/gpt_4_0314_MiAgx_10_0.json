This means that there is a possibility that the snorkel is plonk and there is a possibility that the snork is wibble. The question asks if we can infer that it might be the case that both the snorkel is plonk and the snork is wibble. Since the original statement already presents these possibilities, we can infer that it might be the case that both conditions are true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
