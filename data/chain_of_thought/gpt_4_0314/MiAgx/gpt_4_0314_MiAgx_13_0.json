This means that there is a possibility that the zooble is in quimble and there is a possibility that the plonk flimbles fribble. The rephrased statement says that it might be that the zooble is in quimble and the plonk flimbles fribble, which also implies that there is a possibility of both events happening. Since both statements convey the same meaning, we can infer the rephrased statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
