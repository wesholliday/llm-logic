            "content": "Explanation: The original statement says that the frazzle might be on the zump and the gribble might wozzle a frazzle grooble. This means that there is a possibility that the frazzle is on the zump and there is also a possibility that the gribble wozzles a frazzle grooble. The rephrased statement says that it might be that the frazzle is on the zump and the gribble wozzles a frazzle grooble, which also implies that there is a possibility that both events are happening. Since both statements convey the same meaning, we can infer the rephrased statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
