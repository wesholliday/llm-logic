            "content": "Explanation: The original statement, \"The quibble might be crunk wobble gribble and the zump might quork a flump,\" contains two separate clauses connected by \"and.\" The first clause is about the quibble possibly being crunk wobble gribble, and the second clause is about the zump possibly quorking a flump. The rephrased statement, \"It might be that the quibble is crunk wobble gribble and the zump quorks a flump,\" is essentially expressing the same idea, but it combines the two clauses into one. The rephrased statement still conveys the possibility of both events occurring, so we can infer the rephrased statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
