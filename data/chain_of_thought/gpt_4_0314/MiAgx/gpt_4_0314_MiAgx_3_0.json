This means that there is a possibility that the blimp is in the wozzle and there is a possibility that the flonk quibbles plonk. The rephrased statement says that it might be that the blimp is in the wozzle and the flonk quibbles plonk, which also implies that there is a possibility that both events are happening. Since both statements convey the same meaning, we can infer the rephrased statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
