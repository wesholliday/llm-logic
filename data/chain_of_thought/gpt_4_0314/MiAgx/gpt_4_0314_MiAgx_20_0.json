This means that there is a possibility that the plimp is zibble and there is also a possibility that the snizzle quanks wumble. The rephrased statement, \"It might be that the plimp is zibble and the snizzle quanks wumble,\" is essentially saying the same thing: there is a possibility that both conditions are true. Therefore, we can infer the rephrased statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
