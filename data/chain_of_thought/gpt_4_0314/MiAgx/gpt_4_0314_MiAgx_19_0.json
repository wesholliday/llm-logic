            "content": "Explanation: The original statement says that the crunk might be wibble fribble and the frazzle might quork snork. This means that there is a possibility that the crunk is wibble fribble and there is a possibility that the frazzle quorks snork. The rephrased statement says that it might be that the crunk is wibble fribble and the frazzle quorks snork, which is essentially saying the same thing - that there is a possibility that both conditions are true. Therefore, we can infer the rephrased statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
