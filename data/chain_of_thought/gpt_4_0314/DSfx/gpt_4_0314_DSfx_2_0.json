The wug is not bimmed.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\nSince the first statement presents two possibilities (the wug is bimmed or the wug is flooped), and the second statement negates one of those possibilities (the wug is not bimmed), we are left with only one remaining possibility.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the wug is flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
