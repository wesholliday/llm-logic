We have a statement: \"Either the dreb is spened or it is vroombed.\" This means that one of these two conditions must be true: either the dreb is spened, or the dreb is vroombed.\n\n2. We also have another statement: \"The dreb is not spened.\" This means that the first condition (the dreb is spened) is false.\n\nNow, since we know that one of the two conditions must be true, and we know that the first condition is false, we can infer that the second condition (the dreb is vroombed) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
