We have a statement: \"Either the glip is tragged or it is slogged.\" This means that one of these two conditions must be true: the glip is tragged, or the glip is slogged.\n\n2. We also have another statement: \"The glip is not tragged.\" This means that the first condition (the glip is tragged) is false.\n\nSince we know that one of the two conditions must be true, and we know that the first condition is false, we can infer that the second condition (the glip is slogged) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
