We have a statement that says \"Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked.\" This means that one of these two conditions must be true.\n\n2. We also have a statement that says \"The sprocket is not daggled.\" This means that the first condition (the sprocket being daggled) is false.\n\n3. Since one of the two conditions must be true (from statement 1), and we know that the first condition is false (from statement 2), the only remaining possibility is that the second condition (the sprocket being cranked) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
