Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed.\nThis statement is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions (splat being quanked or splat being morphed) must be true.\n\n2. The splat is not quanked.\nThis statement negates the first condition (splat being quanked) from the disjunction.\n\nNow, since we know that at least one of the conditions in the disjunction must be true, and we also know that the first condition (splat being quanked) is false, the only remaining possibility is that the second condition (splat being morphed) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
