We have a statement: \"Either the whiffle is tinked or it is shanked.\" This means that one of these two conditions must be true: the whiffle is tinked (T) or the whiffle is shanked (S).\n\n2. We also have another statement: \"The whiffle is not tinked.\" This means that the condition T is false.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that the whiffle is shanked (S) based on this information.\n\nSince we know that either T or S must be true, and we know that T is false, the only remaining possibility is that S is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
