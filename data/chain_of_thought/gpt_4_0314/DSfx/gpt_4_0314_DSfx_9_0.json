The twonk is not plinked.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n- Statement 1 is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true (either the twonk is varnished or it is plinked).\n- Statement 2 tells us that the twonk is not plinked.\n\nSince we know that at least one of the conditions in statement 1 must be true, and statement 2 tells us that the twonk is not plinked, we can infer that the other condition must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
