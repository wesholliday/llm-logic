The zinger is not smoogled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n- Statement 1 is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions (smoogled or fraggled) must be true.\n- Statement 2 tells us that the zinger is not smoogled.\n\nSince we know that at least one of the conditions in Statement 1 must be true, and we know from Statement 2 that the zinger is not smoogled, we can infer that the zinger must be fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
