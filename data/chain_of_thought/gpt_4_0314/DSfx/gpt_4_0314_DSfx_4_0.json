We are given two statements: \"Either the fribble is crinked or it is snurgled\" and \"The fribble is not crinked.\"\n2. The first statement is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true (either the fribble is crinked or it is snurgled).\n3. The second statement tells us that the fribble is not crinked.\n\nNow, since we know that the fribble is not crinked, and the first statement tells us that at least one of the conditions must be true, we can infer that the fribble must be snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
