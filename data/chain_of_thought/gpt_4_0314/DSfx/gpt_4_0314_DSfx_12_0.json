The smip is not lupped.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\nSince statement 1 is an \"either-or\" statement, it means that at least one of the two conditions must be true: the smip is lupped, or the smip is shripped.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the smip is not lupped.\n\nGiven that at least one of the conditions in statement 1 must be true, and we know from statement 2 that the smip is not lupped, we can infer that the smip must be shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
