The first statement is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true (either the flob is movated or it is skizzled).\n3. The second statement tells us that the flob is not movated.\n4. Since the first statement requires that at least one of the conditions be true, and we know that the flob is not movated, the only remaining possibility is that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
