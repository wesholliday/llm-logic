In logical terms, this can be represented as (S \u2228 B), where S stands for \"surned\" and B stands for \"bluttered.\"\n\n2. \"The fleeg is not surned\" - This statement negates the possibility of the fleeg being surned. In logical terms, this can be represented as \u00acS, where \u00ac denotes negation.\n\nNow, we want to infer if the fleeg is bluttered based on these two statements. Since we know that either the fleeg is surned or bluttered (S \u2228 B), and we also know that the fleeg is not surned (\u00acS), we can use the logical rule of Disjunctive Syllogism to infer that the fleeg must be bluttered (B).\n\nAnswer: yes",
