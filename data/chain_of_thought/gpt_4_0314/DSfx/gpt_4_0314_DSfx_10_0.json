We have a statement: \"Either the wug is garpled or it is sproinged.\" This means that at least one of the two conditions must be true: the wug is either garpled or sproinged.\n\n2. We also have another statement: \"The wug is not garpled.\" This means that the first condition (the wug being garpled) is false.\n\nNow, since we know that at least one of the two conditions must be true, and we know that the first condition is false, we can infer that the second condition (the wug being sproinged) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
