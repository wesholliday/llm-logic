The flugel is not zargled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n- Statement 1 tells us that there are two possibilities for the flugel: it is either zargled or blimmed.\n- Statement 2 tells us that the flugel is not zargled.\n\nSince we know that the flugel is not zargled (from statement 2), and statement 1 tells us that it must be either zargled or blimmed, the only remaining possibility is that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
