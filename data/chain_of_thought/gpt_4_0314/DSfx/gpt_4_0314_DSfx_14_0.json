We have a statement: \"Either the clug is snugged or it is fleeked.\" This means that one of these two conditions must be true: the clug is either snugged or fleeked.\n\n2. We also have another statement: \"The clug is not snugged.\" This means that the condition of the clug being snugged is false.\n\nNow, since we know that one of the conditions in the first statement must be true, and we have established that the clug is not snugged, the only remaining option is that the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
