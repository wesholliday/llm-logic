We have a statement: \"Either the grommet is plopped or it is sploffed.\" This means that one of these two conditions must be true: the grommet is either plopped or sploffed.\n\n2. We also have another statement: \"The grommet is not plopped.\" This means that the condition of the grommet being plopped is false.\n\nNow, since we know that either the grommet is plopped or sploffed, and we also know that the grommet is not plopped, we can infer that the only remaining possibility is that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
