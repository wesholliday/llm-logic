We have a statement: \"Either the shank is nugged or it is plooked.\" This means that one of these two conditions must be true: either the shank is nugged, or the shank is plooked.\n\n2. We also have another statement: \"The shank is not nugged.\" This means that the first condition (the shank being nugged) is false.\n\nSince we know that one of the two conditions must be true, and we know that the first condition is false, we can infer that the second condition (the shank being plooked) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
