This statement presents two possibilities: the smonk is either plagged or vreebled. Since these are the only two options given, if one is false, the other must be true.\n2. This statement tells us that the smonk is not plagged.\n\nSince we know the smonk is not plagged (from statement 2), and the only other option given is that it is vreebled (from statement 1), we can infer that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
