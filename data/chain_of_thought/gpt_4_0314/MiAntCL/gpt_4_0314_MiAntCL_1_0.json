The statement \"The envelope might be upstairs and under a bed\" is a more specific possibility that falls within the broader possibility of the envelope being upstairs. Since the original statement does not rule out the possibility of the envelope being under a bed, we can infer that it might be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
