If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nIf Ben ate pasta, then according to statement 2, Kate must have eaten the salad. However, statement 1 tells us that Kate did not eat the salad. This means that the condition for statement 2 (Ben ate pasta) cannot be true, because if it were true, it would contradict statement 1.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
