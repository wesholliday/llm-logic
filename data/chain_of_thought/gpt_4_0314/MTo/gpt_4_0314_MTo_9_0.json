If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's think step by step:\n\nIf Lisa bought the red shirt, according to statement 2, Mark would have bought the blue shirt. However, we know from statement 1 that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. Therefore, the condition in statement 2 (Lisa buying the red shirt) must be false, because if it were true, it would lead to a contradiction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
