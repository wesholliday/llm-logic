If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n\nWe are asked if we can infer that \"The shirt was not cotton\" from these statements.\n\nLet's use the contrapositive method. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then reversing their order. So, the contrapositive of statement 2 would be:\n\n2a. If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\n\nNow, let's compare statement 1 and statement 2a:\n\n1. The pants were not denim.\n2a. If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\n\nSince statement 1 is true, and statement 2a is the contrapositive of statement 2 (which means it has the same truth value as statement 2), we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
