If the apple was red, then according to statement 2, the banana would be yellow. However, statement 1 tells us that the banana was not yellow. This means that the condition in statement 2 (the apple being red) cannot be true, because it would lead to a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
