If the doll was plastic, then according to statement 2, the truck would be metal. However, statement 1 tells us that the truck was not metal. This means that the condition for statement 2 (the doll being plastic) cannot be true, because it would lead to a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
