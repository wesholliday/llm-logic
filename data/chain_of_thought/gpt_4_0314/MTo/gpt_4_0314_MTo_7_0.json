If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nWe are asked if we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n- If Alex finished the race, then according to statement 2, Chris would have finished the race. However, we know from statement 1 that Chris did not finish the race. This means that the condition \"Alex finished the race\" cannot be true, because it leads to a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
