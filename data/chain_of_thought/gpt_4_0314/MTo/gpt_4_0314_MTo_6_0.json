It tells us that if Sue's choice was pizza, then Bob's choice must have been pasta.\n\nNow, let's try to infer whether \"Sue did not choose pizza\" from these statements.\n\nIf we assume that Sue chose pizza, then according to the second statement, Bob must have chosen pasta. However, this contradicts the first statement, which says that Bob did not choose pasta. Therefore, our assumption that Sue chose pizza must be incorrect.\n\nSo, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
