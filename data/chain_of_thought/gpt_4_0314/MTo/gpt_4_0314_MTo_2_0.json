If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that if the griffin was in the forest, the unicorn would also be in the forest. However, statement 1 tells us that the unicorn was not in the forest. Since the presence of the griffin in the forest would imply the presence of the unicorn, and we know the unicorn was not there, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
