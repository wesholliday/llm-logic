If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n\nNow, let's analyze the second statement. It is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the bear was in the cave) is true, then the second part (the wolf was in the den) must also be true.\n\nHowever, we know from the first statement that the wolf was not in the den. This means that the second part of the conditional statement is false. In order for the conditional statement to be true, the first part (the bear was in the cave) must also be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the bear was not in the cave. \n\nAnswer: yes",
