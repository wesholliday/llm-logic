If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The alien did not visit Mars\" from these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive form of statement 2, we can rewrite it as:\n\n3. If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nNow, combining statement 1 and statement 3:\n\nSince the robot did not visit Jupiter (statement 1), we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars (statement 3).\n\nAnswer: yes",
