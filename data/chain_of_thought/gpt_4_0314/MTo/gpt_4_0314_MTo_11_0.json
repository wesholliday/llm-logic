If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 2 is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the cake was chocolate) is true, then the second part (the muffins were blueberry) must also be true.\n\nHowever, we know from Statement 1 that the muffins were not blueberry. Since the second part of Statement 2 is false, we can infer that the first part (the cake was chocolate) must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
