If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the dog was inside.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the cat was not outside. This means that the second part of statement 2 (the cat was outside) is false. In an \"if-then\" statement, if the second part (the consequent) is false, then the first part (the antecedent) must also be false for the statement to be true. Therefore, the dog being inside must be false.\n\nAnswer: no",
