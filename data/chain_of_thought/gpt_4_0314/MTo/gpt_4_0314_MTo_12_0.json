If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nWe are asked to infer if Joe did not go to the park.\n\nUsing the second statement, we know that if Joe went to the park, Lucy would have gone to the zoo. However, we know from the first statement that Lucy did not go to the zoo. Therefore, the only possible conclusion is that Joe did not go to the park, because if he did, Lucy would have gone to the zoo, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
