If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n\nWe are asked to infer if Sam did not take a plane.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that Erin did not take a train. Now, let's look at statement 2. It is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Sam took a plane) is true, then the result (Erin took a train) must also be true.\n\nHowever, we already know from statement 1 that Erin did not take a train. This means that the condition in statement 2 (Sam took a plane) cannot be true, because if it were true, then the result (Erin took a train) would also have to be true, which contradicts statement 1.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
