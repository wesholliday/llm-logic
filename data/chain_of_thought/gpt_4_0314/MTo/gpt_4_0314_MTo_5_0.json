If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n\nWe are asked to infer if 'Jeff did not play basketball' is true based on these statements.\n\nLet's use the contrapositive method. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then reversing their order. So, the contrapositive of statement 2 would be:\n\nIf Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nNow, we know from statement 1 that Amy did not play tennis. Therefore, based on the contrapositive, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
