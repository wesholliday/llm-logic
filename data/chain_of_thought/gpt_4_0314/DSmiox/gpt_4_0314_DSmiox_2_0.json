Either the wug is flooped or it must be bimmed.\nThis statement presents two options: the wug is either flooped or it is bimmed.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements together:\n\nSince there is a possibility that the wug is not bimmed (from statement 1), and we know that either the wug is flooped or it must be bimmed (from statement 2), we can infer that if the wug is not bimmed, then it must be flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
