The smonk might not be plagged: This means that it is possible that the smonk is not plagged, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it isn't plagged.\n\n2. Either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged: This means that if the smonk is not vreebled, then it has to be plagged.\n\nNow, let's think step by step:\n\n- If the smonk is not plagged, then according to statement 2, it must be vreebled.\n- If the smonk is plagged, then statement 1 is false, which is a contradiction.\n\nSince we cannot have a contradiction, the smonk must not be plagged. And if the smonk is not plagged, then according to statement 2, it must be vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
