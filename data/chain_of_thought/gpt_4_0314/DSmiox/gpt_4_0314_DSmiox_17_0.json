The flob might not be movated.\nThis statement tells us that there is a possibility that the flob is not movated. It does not confirm that the flob is definitely not movated, just that it might not be.\n\n2. Either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the flob is skizzled, or the flob must be movated. One of these must be true.\n\nNow, let's try to infer if the flob is skizzled:\n\nSince there is a possibility that the flob is not movated (from statement 1), and we know that either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated (from statement 2), we can infer that if the flob is not movated, then it must be skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
