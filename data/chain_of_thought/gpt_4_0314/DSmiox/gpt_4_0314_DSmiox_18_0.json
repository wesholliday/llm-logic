Either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 implies that there is a possibility that the shank is not nugged. It does not confirm that the shank is definitely not nugged.\n\nStatement 2 presents two options: the shank is either plooked or it must be nugged.\n\nSince statement 1 only suggests a possibility and does not confirm that the shank is not nugged, we cannot definitively infer that the shank is plooked based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
