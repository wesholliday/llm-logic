It does not confirm whether the wug is garpled or not.\n\n2. \"Either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled\" - This statement presents two possibilities: the wug is either sproinged or garpled. One of these must be true.\n\nNow, let's try to infer \"The wug is sproinged\" from these statements:\n\nSince there is a possibility that the wug is not garpled (from statement 1), and we know that either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled (from statement 2), we can infer that if the wug is not garpled, then it must be sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
