The splat might not be quanked.\nThis statement implies that there is a possibility that the splat is not quanked, but it doesn't confirm that the splat is definitely not quanked.\n\n2. Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the splat is either morphed or it is quanked. One of these must be true.\n\nNow, let's try to infer if the splat is morphed:\n\nSince there is a possibility that the splat is not quanked (from statement 1), and we know that either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked (from statement 2), we can infer that if the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively conclude that the splat is morphed, because statement 1 only tells us that there is a possibility that the splat is not quanked, not that it is definitely not quanked.\n\nAnswer: no",
