The twonk might not be plinked.\nThis statement implies that there is a possibility that the twonk is not plinked, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that it could be plinked.\n\n2. Either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the twonk is either varnished or it must be plinked. One of these must be true.\n\nNow, let's try to infer if the twonk is varnished:\n\nSince there is a possibility that the twonk is not plinked (from statement 1), and we know that either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked (from statement 2), we can infer that if the twonk is not plinked, then it must be varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
