This means that there is a possibility that she will study either of the two subjects, but it does not necessarily mean that she will study both subjects. The question asks if we can infer that Sarah might study both biology and chemistry. Since the original statement only presents the possibility of her studying one of the two subjects, we cannot infer that she might study both subjects.\n\nAnswer: no",
