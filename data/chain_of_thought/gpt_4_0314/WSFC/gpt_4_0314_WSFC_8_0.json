The question asks if we can infer that the weather might be sunny and it might be rainy. The word \"and\" in this context implies that both conditions can occur simultaneously, which is not possible for weather. However, if we interpret \"and\" as indicating that both possibilities exist, then we can infer that there is a possibility of the weather being sunny and a possibility of it being rainy.\n\nAnswer: yes",
