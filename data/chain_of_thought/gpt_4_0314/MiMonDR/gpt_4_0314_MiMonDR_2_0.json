            "content": "Explanation: The original statement, \"The book might be on the shelf,\" suggests that there is a possibility that the book is on the shelf. The new statement, \"The book might be in the drawer or on the shelf,\" presents two possibilities: the book might be in the drawer, or it might be on the shelf. Since the original statement already establishes the possibility of the book being on the shelf, adding the possibility of it being in the drawer does not contradict the original statement. Therefore, we can infer the new statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
