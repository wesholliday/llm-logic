On the other hand, the statement \"The meeting might be scheduled or cancelled\" implies that there is a possibility that the meeting will take place (scheduled) or not take place (cancelled). Since the first statement only addresses the possibility of the meeting being cancelled, it does not provide information about the possibility of the meeting being scheduled. However, the fact that a meeting is being discussed implies that it was scheduled at some point. Therefore, we can infer that there is a possibility that the meeting might be scheduled or cancelled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
