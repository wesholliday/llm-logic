It does not provide any information about the possibility of the team losing the game. However, since there are only two possible outcomes in a game (winning or losing), if there is a possibility of winning, there must also be a possibility of losing. Therefore, we can infer that \"The team might lose or win the game\" because it covers both possible outcomes.\n\nAnswer: yes",
