However, it does not provide any information about the possibility of the student failing the exam. Since there are only two possible outcomes for the exam (pass or fail), if there is a possibility of passing, then there must also be a possibility of failing. Therefore, we can infer that \"The student might fail or pass the exam.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
