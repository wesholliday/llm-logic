When we consider the statement \"The keys might be in the house or in the car,\" we are expanding the range of possibilities to include the house as well. Since the original statement already allows for the possibility of the keys being in the car, adding the possibility of the keys being in the house does not contradict the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
