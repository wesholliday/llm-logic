However, it does not explicitly state that the project might fail. But, since there are generally only two outcomes for a project - success or failure - if there is a possibility of success, it is reasonable to assume that there is also a possibility of failure. Therefore, we can infer that \"The project might fail or be successful\" because it covers both possible outcomes.\n\nAnswer: yes",
