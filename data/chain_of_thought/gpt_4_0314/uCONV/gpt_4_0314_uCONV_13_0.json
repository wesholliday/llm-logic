            "content": "Let's analyze the given statement and its contrapositive:\n\nGiven statement: If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\nSymbolically, let's represent the car being red as R and the truck being blue as B. So, the given statement can be written as R \u2192 B.\n\nNow, let's find the contrapositive of the given statement. The contrapositive of a statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\". In this case, the contrapositive would be \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\" or \u00acB \u2192 \u00acR.\n\nThe question asks if we can infer that if the truck was blue, then the car was red. Symbolically, this is B \u2192 R. This statement is not the same as the given statement (R \u2192 B) or its contrapositive (\u00acB \u2192 \u00acR). Therefore, we cannot infer that if the truck was blue, then the car was red based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
