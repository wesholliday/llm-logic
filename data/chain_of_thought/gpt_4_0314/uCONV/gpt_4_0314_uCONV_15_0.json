We are given the statement: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This can be represented as P \u2192 T, where P represents Sam taking a plane and T represents Erin taking a train.\n\n2. We want to determine if the following statement is true: \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane.\" This can be represented as T \u2192 P.\n\n3. The given statement (P \u2192 T) does not provide enough information to determine if the reverse statement (T \u2192 P) is true. It is possible that Erin took a train for some other reason, and Sam did not take a plane.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot infer that if Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane.\n\nAnswer: no",
