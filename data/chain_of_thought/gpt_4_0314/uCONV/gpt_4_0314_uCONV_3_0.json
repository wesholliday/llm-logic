However, it does not provide any information about whether James is the only author who writes mystery novels or if there are other authors who write mystery novels as well.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James, as there might be other authors who write mystery novels too.\n\nAnswer: no",
