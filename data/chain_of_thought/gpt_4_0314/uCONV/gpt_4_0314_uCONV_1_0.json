Symbolically, this would be represented as S \u2192 M.\n\nHowever, from the given statement and its contrapositive, we cannot infer S \u2192 M. The given statement only tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, Sue was also there, but it does not guarantee that if Sue was at the wedding, Mary was also there. It is possible that Sue attended the wedding without Mary.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot infer that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding. \n\nAnswer: no",
