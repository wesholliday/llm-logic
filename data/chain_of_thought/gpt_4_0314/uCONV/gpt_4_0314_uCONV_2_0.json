Symbolically, this is: If U, then G.\n\nThe given statement and its contrapositive do not provide enough information to infer the statement \"If U, then G.\" It is possible that the griffin and the unicorn are both in the forest, or that the griffin is not in the forest while the unicorn is. We cannot make a definitive conclusion based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
