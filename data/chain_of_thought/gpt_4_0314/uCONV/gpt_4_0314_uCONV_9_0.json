However, it does not provide any information about what happens if Mark's action is true.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt?\n\nThis question is asking if we can reverse the given statement and still have it be true. In other words, if Mark's action (buying the blue shirt) is true, can we conclude that Lisa's action (buying the red shirt) must also be true?\n\nBased on the given statement, we cannot make this inference. The statement only tells us what happens if Lisa buys the red shirt, not what happens if Mark buys the blue shirt. It is possible that Mark could buy the blue shirt without Lisa buying the red shirt, as the statement does not provide any information about this scenario.\n\nAnswer: no",
