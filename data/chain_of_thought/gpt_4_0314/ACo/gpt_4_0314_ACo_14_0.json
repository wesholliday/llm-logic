If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n\nWe know for sure that the wolf was in the den. The second statement tells us that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf would be in the den. However, this statement does not provide any information about whether the bear was actually in the cave or not. It only tells us the consequence if the bear was in the cave.\n\nSince we do not have any information about the bear's location, we cannot infer that the bear was in the cave.\n\nAnswer: no",
