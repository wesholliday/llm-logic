If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n\nWe are asked to infer if Tom watched football.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Tom watched football) is true, then the second part (Jen watched basketball) must also be true. However, this statement does not guarantee that Tom watched football. It only tells us the consequence if Tom did watch football.\n\nSince we only know that Jen watched basketball, we cannot infer that Tom watched football based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
