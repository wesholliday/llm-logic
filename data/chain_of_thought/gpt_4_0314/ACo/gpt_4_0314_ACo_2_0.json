If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the griffin was in the forest.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the griffin was in the forest) is true, then the second part (the unicorn was in the forest) must also be true. However, knowing that the unicorn was in the forest does not necessarily mean that the griffin was in the forest. The statement does not provide information about the griffin's presence in the forest if the unicorn is already there.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the griffin was in the forest based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
