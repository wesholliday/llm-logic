It tells us that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy would go to the zoo. However, it does not tell us whether Joe actually went to the park or not.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"Joe went to the park\" from these two statements.\n\nWe know that Lucy went to the zoo, but this information alone does not provide any evidence about Joe's actions. The conditional statement tells us that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy would go to the zoo. However, it does not tell us that Joe going to the park is the only condition for Lucy to go to the zoo. There could be other reasons for Lucy going to the zoo.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Joe went to the park based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
