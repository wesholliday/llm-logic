If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n\nWe are asked to infer if Sam took a plane.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that Erin took a train. Statement 2 tells us that if Sam took a plane, then Erin would take a train. However, statement 2 does not provide any information about whether Sam actually took a plane or not. It only tells us the consequence if Sam took a plane.\n\nSince we do not have any information about Sam taking a plane, we cannot infer that Sam took a plane from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
