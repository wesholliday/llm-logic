If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the dog was inside.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that if the dog was inside, the cat would be outside. However, this statement does not provide any information about the dog's location when the cat is outside. The cat being outside could be a result of other factors as well.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the dog was inside based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
