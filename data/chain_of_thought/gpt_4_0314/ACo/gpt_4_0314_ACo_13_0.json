If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the car was red.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that if the car was red, then the truck would be blue. However, this statement does not guarantee that the car being red is the only condition for the truck being blue. The truck could be blue for other reasons as well.\n\nSince we only know that the truck is blue (statement 1) and that the truck being blue is a possible consequence of the car being red (statement 2), we cannot definitively infer that the car was red. There might be other reasons for the truck being blue.\n\nAnswer: no",
