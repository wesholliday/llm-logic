If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the cake was chocolate.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the cake was chocolate) is true, then the second part (the muffins were blueberry) must also be true. However, knowing that the muffins were blueberry does not necessarily mean that the cake was chocolate. There could be other reasons for the muffins being blueberry.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the cake was chocolate based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
