If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n\nWe are asked to infer if Jeff played basketball.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Jeff played basketball) is true, then the second part (Amy played tennis) must also be true. However, this statement does not guarantee that Jeff played basketball. It only tells us the consequence if he did.\n\nWe know that Amy played tennis, but this information alone does not provide any evidence about whether Jeff played basketball or not. The fact that Amy played tennis could be due to other reasons unrelated to Jeff playing basketball.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Jeff played basketball based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
