If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the shirt was cotton.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants would be denim. However, this statement does not guarantee that the shirt being cotton is the only condition for the pants to be denim. The pants being denim could be true even if the shirt is not cotton.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to confirm that the shirt was cotton, we cannot infer that the shirt was cotton based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
