If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the book was written by James.\n\nThe first statement tells us that the book is a mystery novel. The second statement tells us that if the book was written by James, then it would be a mystery novel. However, the second statement does not guarantee that James is the only author who could have written a mystery novel. There could be other authors who have written mystery novels as well.\n\nSince we do not have enough information to confirm that the book was written by James, we cannot infer that the book was written by James.\n\nAnswer: no",
