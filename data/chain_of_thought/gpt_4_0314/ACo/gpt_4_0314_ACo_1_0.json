It tells us that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue also attended the wedding.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"Mary was at the wedding\" from these two statements.\n\nWe know that Sue attended the wedding, but the second statement only tells us what would happen if Mary attended the wedding. It does not provide any information about whether Mary actually attended the wedding or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Mary was at the wedding based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
