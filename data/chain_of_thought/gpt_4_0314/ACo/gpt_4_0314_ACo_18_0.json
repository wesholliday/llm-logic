If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the doll was plastic based on these statements.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the doll was plastic) is true, then the second part (the truck was metal) must also be true. However, this statement does not guarantee that the first part is true if the second part is true. In other words, just because the truck is metal, it doesn't necessarily mean that the doll is plastic.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: no",
