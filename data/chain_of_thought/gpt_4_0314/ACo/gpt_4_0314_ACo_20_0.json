If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the apple was red.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the banana was yellow. Statement 2 is a conditional statement that says if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. However, this statement does not guarantee that the apple being red is the only condition for the banana being yellow. The banana could be yellow for other reasons as well.\n\nSince we do not have enough information to confirm that the apple was red, we cannot infer that the apple was red.\n\nAnswer: no",
