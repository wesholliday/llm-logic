If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nWe are asked to infer if Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that Mark bought the blue shirt. Statement 2 tells us that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark would have bought the blue shirt. However, this statement does not provide any information about whether Lisa actually bought the red shirt or not. It only tells us the consequence of Lisa buying the red shirt.\n\nSince we do not have any information about Lisa's action, we cannot infer that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
