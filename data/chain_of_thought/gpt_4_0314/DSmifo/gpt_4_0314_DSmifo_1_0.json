Fido might not be in the garden: This statement implies that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it doesn't confirm that Fido is definitely not in the garden.\n\n2. Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside: This statement presents two possibilities - Fido is in the garden, or Fido is inside.\n\nNow, let's try to infer if Fido is inside:\n\nSince the first statement doesn't confirm that Fido is definitely not in the garden, we cannot be certain that Fido is inside. There is still a possibility that Fido is in the garden.\n\nAnswer: no",
