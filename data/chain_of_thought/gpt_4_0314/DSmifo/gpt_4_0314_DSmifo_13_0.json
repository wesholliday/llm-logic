The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\nThis statement implies that there is a possibility that the toy is not on the bookshelf, but it doesn't confirm that it is not there.\n\n2. Either the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the toy is on the bookshelf, or it is in the toy box. One of these must be true.\n\nNow, let's try to infer if the toy is in the toy box.\n\nSince the first statement doesn't confirm that the toy is not on the bookshelf, we cannot definitively conclude that the toy is in the toy box. There is still a possibility that the toy is on the bookshelf.\n\nAnswer: no",
