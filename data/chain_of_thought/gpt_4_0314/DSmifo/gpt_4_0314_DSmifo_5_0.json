The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\nThis statement implies that there is a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that they could be in the pantry.\n\n2. Either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the cookies are in the pantry, or they are in the jar. One of these must be true.\n\nNow, let's try to infer if the cookies are in the jar:\n\nSince the first statement doesn't completely rule out the possibility of the cookies being in the pantry, we cannot definitively conclude that the cookies are in the jar. There is still a chance that the cookies could be in the pantry.\n\nAnswer: no",
