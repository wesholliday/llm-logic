Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag.\n\nStatement 1 suggests that there is a possibility that the pen is not on the desk. Statement 2 presents two options: the pen is either on the desk or in the bag.\n\nSince there is a possibility that the pen is not on the desk (according to statement 1), and the only other option given is that it is in the bag (according to statement 2), we can infer that the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
