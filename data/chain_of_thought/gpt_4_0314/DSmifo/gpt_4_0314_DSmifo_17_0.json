Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that there are only two possibilities for the scarf's location: draped on the coat rack or stuffed in the backpack. Since statement 1 tells us that it's possible the scarf is not draped on the coat rack, we can infer that the only other option is that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
