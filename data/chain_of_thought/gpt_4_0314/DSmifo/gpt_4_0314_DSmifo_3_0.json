The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\nThis statement implies that there is a possibility that the keys are not in the cabinet, but it doesn't confirm that they are not there.\n\n2. Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the keys are in the cabinet or they are in the drawer. One of these must be true.\n\nNow, let's try to infer if the keys are in the drawer based on these statements. Since the first statement doesn't confirm that the keys are not in the cabinet, we cannot definitively conclude that the keys are in the drawer. There is still a possibility that the keys are in the cabinet.\n\nAnswer: no",
