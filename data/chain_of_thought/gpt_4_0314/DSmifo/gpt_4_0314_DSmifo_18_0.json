Either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer.\n\nStatement 1 suggests that there is a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand. Statement 2 presents two options: the notebook is either on the nightstand or in the drawer.\n\nSince statement 1 indicates that the notebook may not be on the nightstand, and statement 2 provides only two possible locations for the notebook, we can infer that if the notebook is not on the nightstand, it must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
