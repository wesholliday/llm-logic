Either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag.\n\nFrom statement 2, we have two possibilities: the sunglasses are on her head, or they are in her bag. Statement 1 tells us that it's possible that the sunglasses are not on her head. Since there are only two possibilities given in statement 2, and statement 1 eliminates one of those possibilities, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
