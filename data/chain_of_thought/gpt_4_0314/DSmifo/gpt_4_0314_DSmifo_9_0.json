Either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 suggests that there is a possibility that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor. It does not completely rule out the possibility that it is blending in on the floor.\n\nStatement 2 presents two possibilities: the missing puzzle piece is either blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\n\nSince statement 1 does not completely rule out the possibility that the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor, we cannot definitively infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: no",
