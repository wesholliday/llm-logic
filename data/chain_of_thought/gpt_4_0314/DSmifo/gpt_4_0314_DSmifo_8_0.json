The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\nThis statement implies that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that it could be under the couch.\n\n2. Either the remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the remote control is either under the couch or on the coffee table.\n\nNow, let's try to infer from these statements:\n\nSince statement 1 doesn't completely rule out the possibility of the remote control being under the couch, we cannot definitively conclude that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: no",
