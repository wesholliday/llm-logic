The cat might not be playing in the bedroom.\nThis statement implies that there is a possibility that the cat is not playing in the bedroom, but it doesn't confirm that the cat is definitely not playing in the bedroom.\n\n2. Either the cat is playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the cat is playing in the bedroom, or the cat is napping on the couch. One of these must be true.\n\nNow, let's try to infer if the cat is napping on the couch. Since the first statement doesn't confirm that the cat is definitely not playing in the bedroom, we cannot be certain that the cat is napping on the couch. It could still be playing in the bedroom.\n\nAnswer: no",
