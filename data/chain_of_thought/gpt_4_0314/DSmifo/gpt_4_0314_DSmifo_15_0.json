Either the shoes must be lined up by the door or they are in the closet.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there is a possibility that the shoes are not by the door. Statement 2 presents two options: the shoes are either by the door or in the closet.\n\nSince there is a possibility that the shoes are not by the door (from statement 1), and the only other option given is that they are in the closet (from statement 2), we can infer that if the shoes are not by the door, they must be in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
