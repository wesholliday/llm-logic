The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\nThis statement implies that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. However, it does not confirm that the milk is definitely not in the fridge.\n\n2. Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the milk is in the fridge, or the milk is on the counter. One of these must be true.\n\nNow, let's try to infer if the milk is on the counter:\n\nSince the first statement only suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge, it does not confirm that the milk is definitely not in the fridge. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the milk is on the counter based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
