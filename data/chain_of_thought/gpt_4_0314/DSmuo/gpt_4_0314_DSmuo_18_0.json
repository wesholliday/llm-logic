It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\nThis means that the notebook is not necessarily on the nightstand, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that it could be there.\n\n2. Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the notebook is in the drawer, or it must be on the nightstand.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements. Since we know from statement 1 that the notebook is not necessarily on the nightstand, and statement 2 tells us that it's either in the drawer or on the nightstand, we can infer that the notebook must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
