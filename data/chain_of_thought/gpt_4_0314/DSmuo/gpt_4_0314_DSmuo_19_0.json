It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\nThis statement implies that the watch is not necessarily on his wrist. It could be somewhere else.\n\n2. Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the watch is either charging on the dresser, or it is on his wrist.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from both statements:\n\nSince statement 1 tells us that the watch is not necessarily on his wrist, and statement 2 tells us that the watch is either charging on the dresser or on his wrist, we can infer that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
