It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door.\nThis statement can be represented as \u00acA, where A represents \"the shoes must be lined up by the door.\"\n\n2. Either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door.\nThis statement can be represented as B \u2228 A, where B represents \"the shoes are in the closet.\"\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer B (the shoes are in the closet) from these two statements.\n\nUsing the given information, we can apply the Disjunctive Syllogism rule, which states that if we have a disjunction (B \u2228 A) and the negation of one of the disjuncts (\u00acA), we can infer the other disjunct (B).\n\nSince we have \u00acA and B \u2228 A, we can infer B.\n\nAnswer: yes",
