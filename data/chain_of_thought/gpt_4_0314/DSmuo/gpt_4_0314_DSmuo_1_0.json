We can represent this as \u00ac(Fido must be in the garden).\n\n2. Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\nThis is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two statements is true. We can represent this as (Fido is inside) \u2228 (Fido must be in the garden).\n\nNow, let's use these statements to infer whether Fido is inside.\n\nSince we know that it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden (\u00ac(Fido must be in the garden)), and we also know that either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden ((Fido is inside) \u2228 (Fido must be in the garden)), we can conclude that Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
