We can represent this as \u00acD (not on the desk).\n\n2. Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk.\nThis is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements is true. We can represent this as B \u2228 D (in the bag or on the desk).\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer that the pen is in the bag (B) from these two statements.\n\nSince we know that \u00acD is true (from statement 1), and we have the disjunction B \u2228 D (from statement 2), we can use the principle of disjunctive syllogism. Disjunctive syllogism states that if we have a disjunction (A \u2228 B) and we know that \u00acA is true, then we can conclude that B is true.\n\nIn this case, we have B \u2228 D and \u00acD, so we can conclude that B (the pen is in the bag) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
