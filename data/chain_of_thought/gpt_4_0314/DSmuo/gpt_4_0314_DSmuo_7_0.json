It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\nThis statement can be represented as: \u00ac(umbrella in closet)\n\n2. Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet.\nThis statement can be represented as: (umbrella in car) \u2228 (umbrella in closet)\n\nNow, we want to infer if the umbrella is in the car. Let's use the given statements to see if we can reach this conclusion.\n\nSince we know that \u00ac(umbrella in closet) is true, we can use this information in the second statement:\n\n(umbrella in car) \u2228 \u00ac(umbrella in closet)\n\nSince \u00ac(umbrella in closet) is true, the only way for the entire statement to be true is if (umbrella in car) is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
