It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\nThis means that the keys are not necessarily dangling in the cabinet.\n\n2. Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the keys are in the drawer, or they are dangling in the cabinet.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that the keys are not necessarily dangling in the cabinet, and statement 2 tells us that the keys are either in the drawer or dangling in the cabinet, we can infer that the keys must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
