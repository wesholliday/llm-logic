It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\nThis means that the sunglasses are not necessarily on her head.\n\n2. Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\nThis means that there are only two possibilities: the sunglasses are in her bag or they are on her head.\n\nNow, we know from statement 1 that the sunglasses are not necessarily on her head. Since there are only two possibilities according to statement 2, and one of them is ruled out by statement 1, we can infer that the other possibility must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
