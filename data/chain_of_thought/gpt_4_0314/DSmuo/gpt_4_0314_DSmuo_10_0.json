It could be somewhere else.\n\n2. Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the sock is in the laundry basket, or it is under the bed.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that the missing sock is not necessarily under the bed, and statement 2 tells us that it's either in the laundry basket or under the bed, we can infer that the missing sock must be in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
