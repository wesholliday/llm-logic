It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\nThis statement can be represented as \u00acP (not P), where P stands for \"the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\n2. Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry.\nThis statement can be represented as J \u2228 P (J or P), where J stands for \"the cookies are in the jar.\"\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer 'The cookies are in the jar' (J) from these two statements.\n\nSince we know \u00acP (not P) is true, and we have the statement J \u2228 P (J or P), we can use the principle of disjunction elimination. Disjunction elimination states that if one of the disjuncts (in this case, P) is false, then the other disjunct (in this case, J) must be true.\n\nSo, since \u00acP is true, we can infer that J (the cookies are in the jar) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
