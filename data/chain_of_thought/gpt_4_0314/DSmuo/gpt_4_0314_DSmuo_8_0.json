It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\nThis means that the remote control is not necessarily under the couch, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that it could be there.\n\n2. Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the remote control is either on the coffee table or under the couch.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\nSince statement 1 tells us that the remote control is not necessarily under the couch, and statement 2 gives us only two possibilities (on the coffee table or under the couch), we can infer that the remote control must be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
