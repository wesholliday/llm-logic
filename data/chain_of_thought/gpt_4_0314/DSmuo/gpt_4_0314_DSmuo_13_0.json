It could be somewhere else.\n\n2. Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the toy is in the toy box, or it is on the bookshelf.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from both statements. Since we know from statement 1 that the toy is not necessarily on the bookshelf, and statement 2 tells us that the toy is either in the toy box or on the bookshelf, we can infer that the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
