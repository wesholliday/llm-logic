It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\nThis statement implies that the book might not be on the table.\n\n2. Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the book is on the shelf, or it is on the table.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\nSince it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table (statement 1), and we know that either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table (statement 2), we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
