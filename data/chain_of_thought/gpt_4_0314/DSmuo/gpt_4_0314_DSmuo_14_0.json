It could be somewhere else, but we don't know for sure.\n\n2. Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\nThis statement presents two possibilities: the milk is on the counter, or it is in the fridge.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that the milk is not necessarily in the fridge, and statement 2 tells us that it must be either on the counter or in the fridge, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
