If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n\nWe are asked to infer if 'Jen did not watch basketball' from these statements.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Tom watched football) is true, then the result (Jen watched basketball) must also be true. However, we know from the first statement that Tom did not watch football. This means that the condition in the second statement is false.\n\nWhen the condition in a conditional statement is false, we cannot make any definitive conclusions about the result. In this case, we cannot infer whether Jen watched basketball or not based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
