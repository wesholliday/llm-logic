If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the pants were not denim.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the shirt being cotton) is true, then the result (the pants being denim) must also be true. However, the first statement tells us that the shirt was not cotton. Since the condition is not met, we cannot make any conclusions about the pants being denim or not based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
