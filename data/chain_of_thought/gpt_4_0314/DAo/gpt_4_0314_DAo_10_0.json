If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n\nNow, let's examine the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The dog is outside.\nIn this case, we don't have any information about the cat's location. The cat could be either inside or outside.\n\nScenario 2: The dog is inside.\nThis scenario contradicts the first statement, so it's not possible.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot definitively infer the cat's location. Therefore, we cannot conclude that 'The cat was not outside'.\n\nAnswer: no",
