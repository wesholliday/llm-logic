If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the cake being chocolate) is true, then the result (the muffins being blueberry) must also be true. However, the first statement tells us that the cake was not chocolate. Since the condition is false, the conditional statement does not provide any information about the muffins.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer whether the muffins were blueberry or not based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
