If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the vampire was not awake. \n\nStatement 2 is a conditional statement that tells us that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. However, since we know from statement 1 that the vampire was not awake, we cannot use statement 2 to make any conclusions about the mummy's state of being awake or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the mummy was not awake based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
