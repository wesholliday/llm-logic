If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A, then B. In this case, A is \"the book was written by James\" and B is \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nHowever, we know from the first statement that A is false (the book was not written by James). In a conditional statement, if A is false, then the statement does not provide any information about the truth of B. In other words, we cannot determine whether the book is a mystery novel or not based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
