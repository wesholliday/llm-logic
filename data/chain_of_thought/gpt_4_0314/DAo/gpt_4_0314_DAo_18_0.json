If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the truck was not metal.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the doll was not plastic. Statement 2 is a conditional statement that says if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. However, since we know the doll was not plastic, we cannot determine the material of the truck based on this conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the truck was not metal based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
