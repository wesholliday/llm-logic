If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the griffin was not in the forest. Statement 2 is a conditional statement that tells us that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was also in the forest. However, since we know from statement 1 that the griffin was not in the forest, we cannot use statement 2 to make any conclusions about the unicorn's location.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the unicorn was not in the forest based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
