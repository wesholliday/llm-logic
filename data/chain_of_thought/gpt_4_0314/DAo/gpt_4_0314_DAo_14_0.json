If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the wolf was not in the den.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the bear being in the cave) is true, then the result (the wolf being in the den) must also be true. However, we know from the first statement that the bear was not in the cave. This means that the condition for the second statement is false.\n\nWhen the condition of a conditional statement is false, we cannot make any definitive conclusions about the result. In other words, we cannot infer whether the wolf was in the den or not based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
