If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information:\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Alex finishing the race) is true, then the result (Chris finishing the race) must also be true. However, we know from the first statement that Alex did not finish the race. Therefore, the condition in the second statement is false.\n\nWhen the condition in a conditional statement is false, we cannot make any definitive conclusions about the result. In other words, we cannot infer whether Chris finished the race or not based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
