If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nWe are asked to infer if the banana was not yellow.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the apple was not red. Statement 2 is a conditional statement that says if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. However, since the apple was not red, we cannot determine the color of the banana based on this conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the banana was not yellow based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
