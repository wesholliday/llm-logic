It tells us that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue would also attend the wedding. However, we already know from statement 1 that Mary did not attend the wedding.\n\nSince the condition \"Mary was at the wedding\" is false, the conditional statement does not provide any information about whether Sue attended the wedding or not. Therefore, we cannot infer whether Sue was at the wedding or not based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
