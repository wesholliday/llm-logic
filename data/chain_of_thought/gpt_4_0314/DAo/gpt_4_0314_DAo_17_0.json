If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information:\n\nSince Ben did not eat pasta, the condition for the second statement is not met. The second statement only tells us what would happen if Ben ate pasta, but it doesn't give us any information about what happens when Ben doesn't eat pasta.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer anything about whether Kate ate salad or not based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
