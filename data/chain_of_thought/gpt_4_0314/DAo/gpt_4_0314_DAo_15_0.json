If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n\nWe are asked to infer if Erin did not take a train.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that Sam did not take a plane. Statement 2 is a conditional statement that says if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. However, since we know Sam did not take a plane, the condition for Erin taking a train is not met. \n\nThis means that we cannot infer anything about Erin taking a train or not from the given statements. The information provided does not give us enough evidence to conclude whether Erin took a train or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
