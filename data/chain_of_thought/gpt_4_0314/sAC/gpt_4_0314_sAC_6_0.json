This statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q is \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\n2. \"Bob chose pasta\" is true. This means that Q is true.\n\nNow, we need to determine if P (Sue chose pizza) is true based on the given information. The truth of the conditional statement P \u2192 Q does not guarantee the truth of P. It only guarantees that if P is true, then Q must be true. Since we know Q is true, it is possible that P is true, but it could also be true that P is false and some other factor led to Q being true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that \"Sue chose pizza\" is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
