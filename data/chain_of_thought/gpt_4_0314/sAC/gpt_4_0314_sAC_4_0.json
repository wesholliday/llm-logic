(B)\n\nWe are asked if it follows that the alien visited Mars (A).\n\nThe given statements form a logical structure called \"affirming the consequent.\" In this structure, we know that if A is true, then B is true, and we also know that B is true. However, this does not necessarily mean that A is true. There could be other reasons for B being true that are not related to A.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that the alien visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: no",
