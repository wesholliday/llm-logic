            "content": "Let's analyze the given statements step by step:\n\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is true. This statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If M (Mary was at the wedding), then S (Sue was at the wedding). In other words, if M is true, then S must be true.\n\n2. \"Sue was at the wedding\" is true. This means that S is true.\n\nNow, we need to determine if it follows that \"Mary was at the wedding\" (M) is true.\n\nThe given conditional statement tells us that if M is true, then S must be true. However, it does not tell us that if S is true, then M must be true. In other words, we cannot conclude that Mary being at the wedding is the only reason for Sue being at the wedding. There could be other reasons for Sue being at the wedding that are unrelated to Mary's presence.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
