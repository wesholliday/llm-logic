(Q)\n\nWe are asked to determine if Tom watched football (P) is true.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement (If P, then Q). However, we are only given the truth of the consequent (Q) in the second statement. We cannot directly conclude the truth of the antecedent (P) based on the truth of the consequent (Q) alone.\n\nIn other words, just because Jen watched basketball, it doesn't necessarily mean that Tom watched football. There could be other reasons for Jen watching basketball.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that Tom watched football.\n\nAnswer: no",
