However, it does not tell us anything about the griffin's presence in the forest if the unicorn is already there. In other words, the unicorn being in the forest does not guarantee that the griffin is also in the forest.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that the griffin was in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no",
