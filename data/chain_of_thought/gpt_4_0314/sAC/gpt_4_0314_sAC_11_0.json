(B)\n\nWe are asked to determine if the cake was chocolate (A) based on these statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement (If A, then B). It tells us that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. However, it does not guarantee that the cake being chocolate is the only way for the muffins to be blueberry.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the muffins were indeed blueberry. But this information alone does not provide enough evidence to conclude that the cake was chocolate.\n\nIn other words, we know that if A is true, then B is true. We also know that B is true. However, we cannot conclude that A is true based on this information alone. There could be other reasons for the muffins being blueberry that are not related to the cake being chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no",
