The book is a mystery novel.\n\nWe are asked if it follows that 'The book was written by James' is true.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the book was written by James) is true, then the result (the book is a mystery novel) must also be true. However, this statement does not guarantee that the book being a mystery novel implies that it was written by James.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the book is a mystery novel, but it does not provide any information about the author.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot conclude that the book was written by James.\n\nAnswer: no",
