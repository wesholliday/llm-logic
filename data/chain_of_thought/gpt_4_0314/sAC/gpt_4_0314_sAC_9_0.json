(B)\n\nWe are asked if it follows that Lisa bought the red shirt (A).\n\nThe given statements are in the form of a conditional statement (If A, then B). However, we are given the truth of the consequent (B) and asked to determine the truth of the antecedent (A). This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent, which is an invalid form of reasoning. Just because the consequent (B) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (A) is true.\n\nFor example, consider the following statements:\n\n1. If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\n2. The ground is wet.\n\nJust because the ground is wet, it does not necessarily mean that it is raining. There could be other reasons for the ground being wet, such as someone watering the plants or a spilled drink.\n\nSimilarly, in our case, just because Mark bought the blue shirt, it does not necessarily mean that Lisa bought the red shirt. There could be other reasons for Mark buying the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
