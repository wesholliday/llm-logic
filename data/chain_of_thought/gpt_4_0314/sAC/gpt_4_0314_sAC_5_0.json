This statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If P, then Q. In this case, P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\n2. \"Amy played tennis\" is true. This means that Q is true.\n\nNow, we need to determine if P (Jeff played basketball) is true based on the given information. The conditional statement (If P, then Q) being true only guarantees that if P is true, then Q must be true. However, it does not guarantee that if Q is true, then P must be true.\n\nIn other words, we know that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. We also know that Amy played tennis. But we cannot conclude that Jeff played basketball based on this information alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
