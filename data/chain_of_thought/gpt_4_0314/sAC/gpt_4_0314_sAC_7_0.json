This statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: A \u2192 C, where A represents \"Alex finished the race\" and C represents \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\n2. \"Chris finished the race\" is true. This means that C is true.\n\nNow, we need to determine if it follows that \"Alex finished the race\" (A) is true.\n\nThe conditional statement A \u2192 C being true means that if A is true, then C must be true. However, it does not guarantee that if C is true, then A must be true. There could be other reasons for Chris finishing the race that are not dependent on Alex finishing the race.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that \"Alex finished the race\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
