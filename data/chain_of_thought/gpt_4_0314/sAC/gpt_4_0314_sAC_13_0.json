This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If P (car is red), then Q (truck is blue).\n\n2. \"The truck was blue\" is true. This means that Q (truck is blue) is true.\n\nNow, we need to determine if P (car is red) is true based on the given information. The conditional statement (If P, then Q) being true only guarantees that if P is true, then Q must be true. However, it does not guarantee that if Q is true, then P must be true.\n\nIn other words, we know that if the car was red, the truck would be blue. But we don't know if the car being red is the only condition that would make the truck blue. The truck being blue could be true for other reasons as well.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that \"The car was red\" is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
