This can be represented as P \u2192 T, where P is \"Sam took a plane\" and T is \"Erin took a train.\"\n\n2. \"Erin took a train\" is true. This means T is true.\n\nNow, we need to determine if P (Sam took a plane) is true based on the given information. The statement P \u2192 T only tells us that if P is true, then T must be true. However, it does not tell us that if T is true, then P must be true. In other words, we cannot conclude that Sam took a plane just because Erin took a train.\n\nAnswer: no",
