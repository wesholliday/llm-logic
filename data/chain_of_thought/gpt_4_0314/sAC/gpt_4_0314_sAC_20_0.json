(B)\n\nWe are asked to determine if the apple was red (A).\n\nFrom the given statements, we know that if the apple was red, then the banana would be yellow. We also know that the banana was indeed yellow. However, this information does not necessarily mean that the apple was red. There could be other reasons for the banana being yellow.\n\nIn other words, the truth of the statement \"If A, then B\" and the truth of statement \"B\" does not guarantee the truth of statement \"A.\" This is a logical fallacy called \"affirming the consequent.\"\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that the apple was red.\n\nAnswer: no",
