The griffin was in the forest.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\nStep 1: We know that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (griffin in the forest) is true, then the result (unicorn in the forest) must also be true.\n\nStep 2: We are given that the griffin was in the forest. This means that the condition in the conditional statement is true.\n\nStep 3: Since the condition is true, we can infer that the result (unicorn in the forest) must also be true, according to the conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
