(This is a given fact: P)\n\nNow, we can use the Modus Ponens rule of inference, which states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know that P is true, then we can infer that Q is true.\n\nIn this case, P is \"The doll was plastic\" and Q is \"The truck was metal\". Since we know that P is true, we can infer that Q is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
