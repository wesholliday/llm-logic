Ben ate pasta.\n\nNow, we can use the logical rule of Modus Ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know that P is true, then we can infer that Q is true.\n\nIn this case, our conditional statement is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\" (If P, then Q), and we know that \"Ben ate pasta\" (P) is true. Therefore, we can infer that \"Kate ate the salad\" (Q) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
