The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the cake being chocolate) is true, then the consequence (the muffins being blueberry) must also be true.\n\nSince the second statement confirms that the cake was indeed chocolate, we can infer that the condition in the first statement is true. Therefore, the consequence (the muffins being blueberry) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
