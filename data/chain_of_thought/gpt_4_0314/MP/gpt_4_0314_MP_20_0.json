The apple was red.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n- The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the result (the banana being yellow) must also be true.\n- The second statement confirms that the condition (the apple being red) is indeed true.\n\nSince the condition is true, we can infer that the result (the banana being yellow) must also be true, according to the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
