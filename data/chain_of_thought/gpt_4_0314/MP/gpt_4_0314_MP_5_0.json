This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A, then B (where A is \"Jeff played basketball\" and B is \"Amy played tennis\").\n\n2. Jeff played basketball. This statement tells us that A is true.\n\nNow, we can use the information from the conditional statement (If A, then B) and the fact that A is true to infer whether B is true or not.\n\nSince the conditional statement tells us that if A is true, then B must also be true, and we know that A is true, we can infer that B (Amy played tennis) is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
