This statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A, then B (where A is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and B is \"Sue was at the wedding\").\n\n2. Mary was at the wedding. This statement confirms that A is true.\n\nNow, we can use the information from the conditional statement (If A, then B) and the fact that A is true to infer whether Sue was at the wedding or not.\n\nSince A is true (Mary was at the wedding), and the conditional statement tells us that if A is true, then B must also be true, we can infer that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
