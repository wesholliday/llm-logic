Alex finished the race.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n- The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Alex finishing the race) is true, then the result (Chris finishing the race) must also be true.\n- The second statement confirms that the condition (Alex finishing the race) is indeed true.\n\nSince the condition is true, we can infer that the result (Chris finishing the race) must also be true, based on the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
