The vampire was awake.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\nStep 1: We know that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (vampire being awake) is true, then the result (mummy being awake) must also be true.\n\nStep 2: We are given that the vampire was awake. This means that the condition in the conditional statement is true.\n\nStep 3: Since the condition (vampire being awake) is true, we can infer that the result (mummy being awake) must also be true, based on the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the mummy was awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
