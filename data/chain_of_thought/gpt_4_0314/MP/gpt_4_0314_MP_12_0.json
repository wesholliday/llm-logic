Joe went to the park.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n- The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Joe going to the park) is true, then the result (Lucy going to the zoo) must also be true.\n- The second statement confirms that the condition (Joe going to the park) is true.\n\nSince the condition is true, we can infer that the result (Lucy going to the zoo) must also be true, based on the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
