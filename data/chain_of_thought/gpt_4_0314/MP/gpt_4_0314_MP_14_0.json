The bear was in the cave.\n\nWe can represent this information using conditional logic:\n\n1. If A (bear in the cave), then B (wolf in the den).\n2. A (bear in the cave) is true.\n\nAccording to the rules of conditional logic, if the premise (A) is true, then the conclusion (B) must also be true. In this case, since the bear is in the cave (A is true), we can infer that the wolf is in the den (B is true).\n\nAnswer: yes",
