So, the given statement can be written as A \u2192 B.\n\nNow, let's consider the contrapositive of the given statement: If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\nSymbolically, this can be written as \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA.\n\nThe contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, so if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statement we want to infer: If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\nSymbolically, this can be written as B \u2192 A.\n\nComparing the original statement (A \u2192 B) and the statement we want to infer (B \u2192 A), we can see that they are not the same, nor are they contrapositives of each other. Therefore, we cannot infer the statement 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red' from the given statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'.\n\nAnswer: no",
