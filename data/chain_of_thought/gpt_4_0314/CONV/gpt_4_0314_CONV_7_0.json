The given statement tells us that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race as well. However, it does not guarantee that if Chris finished the race, then Alex must have finished the race too.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement 'If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
