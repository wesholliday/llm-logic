Here, A represents \"Tom watched football\" and B represents \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer the statement \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football\" from the given statement. This new statement can be represented as: If B, then A.\n\nThe given statement (If A, then B) does not provide enough information to guarantee that the reverse (If B, then A) is true. It is possible that Jen watched basketball without Tom watching football, but we cannot infer that from the given statement alone.\n\nSo, after analyzing the given statement and the statement we need to infer, we can conclude:\n\nAnswer: no",
