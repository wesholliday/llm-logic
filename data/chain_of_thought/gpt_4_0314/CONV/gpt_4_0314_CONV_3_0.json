Here, A represents \"the book was written by James\" and B represents \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nNow, we are asked to infer if the following statement is true: \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James.\" This can be represented as: If B, then A.\n\nTo determine if we can infer this statement, we need to see if the relationship between A and B is reversible. In other words, we need to see if the truth of B guarantees the truth of A.\n\nHowever, the given statement only tells us that if the book was written by James (A), then it is a mystery novel (B). It does not guarantee that if a book is a mystery novel (B), it must have been written by James (A). There could be other authors who have written mystery novels as well.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
