However, the given statement (P \u2192 Q) only tells us what happens if Sam took a plane (Erin took a train). It does not provide any information about what happens if Erin took a train.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
