This means if the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statement we want to infer: If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was in the forest. Symbolically, this is: If U, then G.\n\nThe given statement and its contrapositive do not provide enough information to infer the statement \"If U, then G.\" It is possible that the griffin and the unicorn were both in the forest, or that the griffin was elsewhere while the unicorn was in the forest. We cannot conclude that the presence of the unicorn in the forest guarantees the presence of the griffin in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no",
