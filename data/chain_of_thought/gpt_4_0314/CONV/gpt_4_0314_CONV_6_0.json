This is because it is possible for Bob to choose pasta without Sue choosing pizza. For example, Sue could have chosen a salad, and Bob still chose pasta. In this case, P \u2192 Q is true, but Q \u2192 P is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
