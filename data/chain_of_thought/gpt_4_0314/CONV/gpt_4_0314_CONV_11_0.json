In this case, P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer the converse of the given statement, which is: \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate.\" This would be represented as: If Q, then P.\n\nHowever, the original statement (If P, then Q) does not guarantee that the converse (If Q, then P) is true. It is possible that the muffins could be blueberry for reasons other than the cake being chocolate. \n\nFor example, imagine a scenario where the cake is not chocolate, but the muffins are still blueberry. In this case, the original statement is not violated, but the converse would be false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the converse of the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
