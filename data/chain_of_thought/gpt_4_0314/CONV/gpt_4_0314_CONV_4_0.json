Here, A represents the alien visiting Mars, and B represents the robot visiting Jupiter.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer the statement: \"If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien visited Mars.\" This can be represented as: If B, then A.\n\nThe original statement (If A, then B) does not provide enough information to guarantee that the reverse statement (If B, then A) is true. It is possible that the robot visited Jupiter without the alien visiting Mars, or that there are other conditions that led to the robot visiting Jupiter.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer the reverse statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
