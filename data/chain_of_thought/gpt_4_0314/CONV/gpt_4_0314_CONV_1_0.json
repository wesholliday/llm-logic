It is possible that Sue was at the wedding without Mary being there. The given statement only tells us that if Mary was there, then Sue was there, but it does not provide any information about the reverse scenario.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
