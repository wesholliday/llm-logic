(A: Lisa bought the red shirt, B: Mark bought the blue shirt)\n\nNow, we need to determine if the following statement is true: If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\nThis can be represented as: If B, then A.\n\nTo infer the second statement (If B, then A) from the first statement (If A, then B), we need to check if the relationship between A and B is reversible. In other words, we need to determine if the truth of B guarantees the truth of A.\n\nIn this case, the given statement only tells us that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. However, it does not guarantee that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa must have bought the red shirt. It is possible that Mark bought the blue shirt, but Lisa did not buy the red shirt (maybe she bought a different color or didn't buy a shirt at all).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
