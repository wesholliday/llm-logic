In this case, A represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and B represents \"the pants were denim.\"\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer the converse of the given statement, which is: \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton.\" This can be represented as: If B, then A.\n\nTo determine if we can infer the converse, we need to examine the relationship between A and B. The original statement tells us that if A is true (the shirt is cotton), then B must be true (the pants are denim). However, it does not tell us that if B is true (the pants are denim), then A must be true (the shirt is cotton).\n\nIt is possible that there could be other scenarios where the pants are denim, but the shirt is not cotton. Therefore, we cannot infer the converse of the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
