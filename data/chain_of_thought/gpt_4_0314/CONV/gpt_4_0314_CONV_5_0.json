In this case, P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nNow, we are asked to infer if the following statement is true: \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball.\" This statement can be represented as: If Q, then P.\n\nTo determine if we can infer this statement from the given statement, we need to see if the truth of Q guarantees the truth of P. In other words, does Amy playing tennis guarantee that Jeff played basketball?\n\nThe given statement only tells us that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. It does not provide any information about what happens if Amy played tennis. It is possible that Amy played tennis and Jeff did not play basketball, or that they both played their respective sports.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
