Either the shank is plooked or it is nugged.\n\nWe are asked if we can infer that \"The shank is plooked\" from these statements.\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that the shank is not nugged, and statement 2 tells us that either the shank is plooked or it is nugged, we can conclude that the shank must be plooked because the other option (nugged) has been ruled out.\n\nAnswer: yes",
