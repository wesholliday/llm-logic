Either the flug is blummed or it is zimmed.\n\nWe are asked to infer if 'The flug is blummed' from these statements.\n\nSince the first statement tells us that the flug is not zimmed, we can eliminate the possibility of the flug being zimmed from the second statement. This leaves us with only one option, which is that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
