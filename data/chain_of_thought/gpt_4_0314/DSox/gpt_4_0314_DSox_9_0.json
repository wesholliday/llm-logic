Either the twonk is varnished or it is plinked.\n\nWe are asked to infer if 'The twonk is varnished' based on these statements.\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that the twonk is not plinked, we can eliminate the possibility of it being plinked in statement 2. This leaves us with the only remaining option, which is that the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
