Either the dreb is vroombed or it is spened.\n\nWe are asked if we can infer \"The dreb is vroombed\" from these statements.\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that the dreb is not spened, and statement 2 tells us that either the dreb is vroombed or it is spened, we can conclude that the dreb must be vroombed, as it cannot be spened.\n\nAnswer: yes",
