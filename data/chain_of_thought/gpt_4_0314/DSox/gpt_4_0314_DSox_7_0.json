Either the whiffle is shanked or it is tinked.\n\nWe are asked to infer if 'The whiffle is shanked' from these statements.\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that the whiffle is not tinked, we can eliminate the possibility of the whiffle being tinked from statement 2. This leaves us with the only remaining option, which is that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
