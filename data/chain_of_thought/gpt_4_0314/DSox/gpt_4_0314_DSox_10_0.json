Either the wug is sproinged or it is garpled.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The wug is sproinged\" from these statements.\n\nUsing the first statement, we know that the wug is not garpled. Now, let's look at the second statement. It says that either the wug is sproinged or it is garpled.
