Either the fribble is snurgled or it is crinked.\n\nNow, let's use these statements to infer whether the fribble is snurgled or not.\n\nSince the fribble is not crinked (from statement 1), and either the fribble is snurgled or it is crinked (from statement 2), we can conclude that the fribble must be snurgled. This is because the only other option (crinked) has been ruled out by statement 1.\n\nAnswer: yes",
