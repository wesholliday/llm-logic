Either the flugel is blimmed or it is zargled.\n\nWe are asked to infer if 'The flugel is blimmed' from these statements.\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that the flugel is not zargled, we can eliminate the possibility of the flugel being zargled in statement 2. This leaves us with only one option, which is that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
