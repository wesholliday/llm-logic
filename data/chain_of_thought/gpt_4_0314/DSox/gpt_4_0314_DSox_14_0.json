Either the clug is fleeked or it is snugged.\n\nWe are asked to infer if 'The clug is fleeked' based on these statements.\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that the clug is not snugged, we can eliminate the possibility of the clug being snugged in statement 2. This leaves us with only one option, which is that the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
