Kate ate salad (Q)\n\nWe are asked if it necessarily follows that Ben ate pasta (P).\n\nThe given statements are an example of the logical concept called \"affirming the consequent.\" Affirming the consequent is a logical fallacy because it assumes that if the consequent (Q) is true, then the antecedent (P) must also be true. However, this is not necessarily the case.\n\nIn this situation, we know that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. We also know that Kate ate salad. However, we cannot conclude that Ben ate pasta because there could be other reasons for Kate eating salad that are unrelated to Ben eating pasta.\n\nAnswer: no",
