Jen watched basketball (This is a given fact)\n\nNow, we need to determine if it necessarily follows that Tom watched football.\n\nThe conditional statement (1) tells us that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. However, it does not tell us that Tom watching football is the only way for Jen to watch basketball. There could be other reasons or scenarios where Jen watched basketball.\n\nSince we know that Jen watched basketball (2), it is possible that Tom watched football, but it is not necessarily true. There could be other reasons for Jen watching basketball that we are not aware of.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that Tom watched football for certain.\n\nAnswer: no",
