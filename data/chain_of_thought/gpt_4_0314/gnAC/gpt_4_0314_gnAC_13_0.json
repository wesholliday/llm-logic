The truck was blue (B)\n\nWe are asked if it necessarily follows that the car was red (A).\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement (If A, then B). It tells us that if the car was red, the truck must be blue. However, it does not tell us what happens if the car is not red. The truck could still be blue even if the car is not red.\n\nThe second statement confirms that the truck is indeed blue. But this information alone does not guarantee that the car was red. The truck being blue could be a result of the car being red, or it could be blue for some other reason.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that the car was red.\n\nAnswer: no",
