(B)\n\nWe are asked if it necessarily follows that the alien visited Mars (A).\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement (If A, then B). It tells us that if the alien visited Mars, the robot visited Jupiter. However, it does not tell us what happens if the robot visited Jupiter without the alien visiting Mars.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the robot visited Jupiter (B). But it does not provide any information about the alien visiting Mars (A).\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot conclude that the alien visited Mars. The robot visiting Jupiter could have happened independently of the alien visiting Mars.\n\nAnswer: no",
