(B)\n\nWe are asked if it necessarily follows that the bear was in the cave (A).\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement (If A, then B). It tells us that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. However, it does not tell us what happens if the wolf is in the den without any information about the bear.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the wolf was in the den, but it does not provide any information about the bear.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot conclude that the bear was in the cave. The wolf being in the den could be true without the bear being in the cave.\n\nAnswer: no",
