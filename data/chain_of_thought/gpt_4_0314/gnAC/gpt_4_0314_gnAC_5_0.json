Amy played tennis (True)\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the second part (Amy playing tennis) must also be true. However, this statement does not guarantee that if Amy played tennis, then Jeff must have played basketball.\n\nThe second statement tells us that Amy played tennis, which is true. But this information alone does not provide any direct information about whether Jeff played basketball or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that Jeff played basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
