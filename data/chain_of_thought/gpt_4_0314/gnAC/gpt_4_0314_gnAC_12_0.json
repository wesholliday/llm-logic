Lucy went to the zoo (True)\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Joe went to the park) is true, then the second part (Lucy went to the zoo) must also be true. However, this statement does not guarantee that if the second part is true, the first part must also be true.\n\nSince we know that Lucy went to the zoo (statement 2), it is possible that Joe went to the park, but it is not necessarily true. There could be other reasons for Lucy going to the zoo that are not related to Joe going to the park.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that Joe went to the park based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
