(M)\n\nWe are asked if it necessarily follows that the vampire was awake (V).\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement (If V, then M). It tells us that if the vampire was awake, the mummy must also be awake. However, it does not tell us what happens if the mummy is awake without any information about the vampire.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the mummy was awake, but it does not provide any information about the vampire.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot conclude that the vampire was awake. It is possible that the mummy was awake without the vampire being awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
