The pants were denim.\n\nWe are asked if it necessarily follows that the shirt was cotton.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If A, then B. In this case, A represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and B represents \"the pants were denim.\"\n\nThe second statement confirms that B is true, i.e., the pants were denim.\n\nHowever, knowing that B is true does not necessarily mean that A is true. The conditional statement only tells us that if A is true, then B must be true. It does not tell us that if B is true, then A must be true.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that the shirt was cotton.\n\nAnswer: no",
