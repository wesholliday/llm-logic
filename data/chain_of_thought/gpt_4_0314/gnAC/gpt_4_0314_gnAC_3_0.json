The book is a mystery novel (True)\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure. The first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\n\nIf A (the book was written by James), then B (the book is a mystery novel).\n\nThe second statement tells us that B (the book is a mystery novel) is true. However, this does not necessarily mean that A (the book was written by James) is true. It is possible that the book is a mystery novel written by another author.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that the book was written by James.\n\nAnswer: no",
