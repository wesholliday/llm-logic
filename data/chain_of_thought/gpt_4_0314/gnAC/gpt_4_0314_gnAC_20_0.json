The banana was yellow (B)\n\nWe are asked if it necessarily follows that the apple was red (A).\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement (If A, then B). It tells us that if the apple was red, the banana must be yellow. However, it does not tell us what happens if the apple is not red. The banana could still be yellow even if the apple is not red.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the banana is indeed yellow. But this information alone does not provide any information about the color of the apple.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that the apple was red based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
