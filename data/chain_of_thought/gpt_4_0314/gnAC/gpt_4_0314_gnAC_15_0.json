Erin took a train (Q)\n\nWe are asked if it necessarily follows that Sam took a plane (P).\n\nThe given statements are an example of the logical concept called \"affirming the consequent.\" This is a logical fallacy because it assumes that if the consequent (Q) is true, then the antecedent (P) must also be true. However, this is not necessarily the case.\n\nFor example, it could be possible that Erin took a train for some other reason unrelated to Sam taking a plane. The fact that Erin took a train does not guarantee that Sam took a plane.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that Sam took a plane.\n\nAnswer: no",
