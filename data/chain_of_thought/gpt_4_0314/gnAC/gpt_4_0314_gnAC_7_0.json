However, it doesn't tell us anything about what happens if Chris finishes the race without any information about Alex.\n\n2. \"Chris finished the race is true\" - This statement confirms that Chris indeed finished the race.\n\nNow, we need to determine if it necessarily follows that \"Alex finished the race\" is true. The first statement only tells us the consequence of Alex finishing the race, but it doesn't tell us the conditions under which Chris can finish the race. It is possible that Chris finished the race even if Alex didn't finish the race.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot necessarily conclude that \"Alex finished the race\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
