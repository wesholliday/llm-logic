(Q)\n\nWe are asked if it necessarily follows that the doll was plastic (P).\n\nThe given statements are an example of the logical form called \"affirming the consequent.\" In this form, we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the affirmation of the consequent (Q). However, affirming the consequent does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (P).\n\nIn other words, just because the truck was metal (Q) does not necessarily mean that the doll was plastic (P). There could be other reasons for the truck being metal that are unrelated to the doll being plastic.\n\nAnswer: no",
