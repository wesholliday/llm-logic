This means that there are two possibilities: either the zazzle is zooble, or it is on froodle. The statement does not provide any information about whether both possibilities can be true at the same time. Therefore, we cannot infer that the zazzle might be zooble AND it might be on froodle, as this would imply that both possibilities can be true simultaneously.\n\nAnswer: no",
