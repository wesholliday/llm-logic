Modus tollens states:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's map our example onto this structure:\n\n* P: The wug was sproinged.\n* Q: The wug was garpled.\n\nOur premises match the first two lines of *modus tollens*. Therefore, we can validly conclude the third line, which is our desired conclusion.\n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
