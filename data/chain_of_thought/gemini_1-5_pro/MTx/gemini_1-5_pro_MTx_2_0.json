This is a conditional statement, meaning it sets up a relationship where the first part (the wug was flooped) being true guarantees the second part (the wug bimmed the zoint) is also true. \n* **Statement 2:** The wug did not bim the zoint. This directly contradicts the second part of Statement 1.\n* **Reasoning:** Since we know the wug did NOT bim the zoint (Statement 2), we can infer that the first part of Statement 1 MUST also be false.  Why? Because if the wug WAS flooped, it WOULD have bimmed the zoint according to the rule set up in Statement 1.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
