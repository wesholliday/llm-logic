This means IF the fribble was snurgled, THEN it MUST have crinkled.\n\nPremise 2 tells us the fribble did NOT crink.  Since the crinkling was DEPENDENT on the snurgling (because of Premise 1), the fribble could not have been snurgled. If it had been snurgled, it would have crinkled.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
