This is a conditional statement, like saying \"If it rains, then the ground is wet.\"\n* **Statement 2:** The flugel was not zargled. This tells us the \"then\" part of our conditional statement is false.\n\nNow, think about the rain example. If the ground is NOT wet, can we conclude it didn't rain? Yes, because if it HAD rained, the ground WOULD be wet.\n\nWe can apply the same logic here. If the flugel WAS blimmed, it WOULD have been zargled (according to statement 1). Since it wasn't zargled, it couldn't have been blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
