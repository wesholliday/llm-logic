This means at least one of the following must be true: the shank is plooked, or the shank is nugged.\n* **Statement 2:** The shank might not be nugged. This means it's possible the shank is not nugged. \n\nNow let's consider the possibilities:\n\n* **Possibility 1: The shank is nugged.** This would satisfy Statement 1. However, it contradicts Statement 2, which says the shank might *not* be nugged. So this possibility is ruled out.\n* **Possibility 2: The shank is not nugged.** This fits with Statement 2.  Since Statement 1 says it MUST be either plooked or nugged, and we've ruled out nugged, the shank must be plooked.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
