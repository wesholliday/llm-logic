This means at least one of the following must be true: the smonk is vreebled, or the smonk is plagged. \n* **Statement 2:** The smonk might not be plagged. This introduces the possibility that the smonk is NOT plagged.\n\nNow let's consider the possibilities:\n\n* **Possibility 1: The smonk is plagged.** This possibility is allowed by Statement 1, but it contradicts Statement 2. \n* **Possibility 2: The smonk is not plagged.** This possibility is allowed by Statement 2. If this is the case, and considering Statement 1 (at least one of the two options must be true), then the smonk MUST be vreebled.\n\nTherefore, if the smonk might not be plagged, then it must be vreebled to satisfy the first statement.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
