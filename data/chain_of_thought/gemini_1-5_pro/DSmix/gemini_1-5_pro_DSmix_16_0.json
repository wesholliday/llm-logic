This means at least one of the following must be true: the sneg is crampled, or the sneg is sproted.\n* **Statement 2:** The sneg might not be sproted. This means it's possible that the sneg is not sproted.\n\nNow let's consider the possibilities:\n\n* **Possibility 1: The sneg is sproted.** This possibility contradicts Statement 2, so it's not possible.\n* **Possibility 2: The sneg is not sproted.** This possibility aligns with Statement 2.  Since Statement 1 says the sneg MUST be either crampled or sproted, and we've established it might not be sproted, the only remaining option is that it must be crampled.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
