This means at least one of the two options must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The wug might not be garpled. This tells us that being garpled is not definitely true for the wug. \n\nNow let's consider the possibilities:\n\n* **If the wug is garpled:** This would contradict Premise 2, which says it might not be.\n* **If the wug is not garpled:**  Premise 1 states that if it's not garpled, it MUST be sproinged.\n\nTherefore, since the wug might not be garpled, the only remaining possibility to satisfy Premise 1 is that the wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
