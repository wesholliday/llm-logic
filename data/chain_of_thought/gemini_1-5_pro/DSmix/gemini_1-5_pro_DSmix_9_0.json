This tells us there are two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n* **Statement 2:** The twonk might not be plinked. This tells us that one of the possibilities in Statement 1 might not be true.\n\nNow, if the twonk might not be plinked (Statement 2), then according to Statement 1, the other possibility must be true to satisfy the \"either/or\" condition. \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
