This presents two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n* **Statement 2:** The sprocket might not be daggled. This introduces uncertainty about the second possibility in Statement 1.\n\nNow, if the sprocket might *not* be daggled (Statement 2), then the only way Statement 1 can still be true is if the sprocket *is* cranked. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
