This means there are two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n* **Statement 2:** The zinger might not be smoogled. This tells us that it's possible for the second part of statement 1 to be false.\n\nNow, if the second part of statement 1 *might* be false, then the first part *must* be true in order for the entire statement to hold. \n\n**Answer: Yes** \n"
