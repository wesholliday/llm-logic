This means at least one of the two options must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The fleeg might not be surned. This introduces the possibility that the second option in Premise 1 is false. \n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nIf the fleeg might not be surned, then the only way for Premise 1 to still hold true is if the fleeg is bluttered. \n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
