This means at least one of the two options must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The smip might not be lupped. This means it's possible that the smip is NOT lupped. \n\nNow, if the smip might NOT be lupped (Premise 2), and at least one of the options in Premise 1 MUST be true, then the only remaining possibility is that the smip IS shripped.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
