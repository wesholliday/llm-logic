This tells us we have two possibilities, and at least one must be true. \n* **Statement 2:** The wug might not be bimmed. This tells us that one of the possibilities in Statement 1, specifically \"the wug is bimmed\", might not be true.\n\nNow, if \"the wug is bimmed\" might not be true, then according to Statement 1, \"the wug is flooped\" MUST be true to satisfy the \"either/or\" condition.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
