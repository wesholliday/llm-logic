This means at least one of the two options must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The dreb might not be spened. This tells us that it's possible for the second option in Premise 1 to be false. \n\nNow, if the second option *might* be false, then the first option (the dreb is vroombed) must be true to satisfy Premise 1.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
