This means at least one of the following must be true: \n    * The splat is morphed.\n    * The splat is quanked.\n* **Statement 2:** The splat might not be quanked. This means it's possible the splat is not quanked.\n\nNow let's consider the possibilities:\n\n* **Possibility 1: The splat is quanked.** This possibility is allowed by Statement 1 and doesn't contradict Statement 2.\n* **Possibility 2: The splat is not quanked.**  Statement 2 allows for this. If this is the case, then Statement 1 tells us the splat MUST be morphed.\n\nSince we can't rule out the splat being quanked, we don't definitively know if the splat is morphed. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
