This means at least one of the two options must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The glip might not be tragged. This tells us it's possible for the glip to NOT be tragged. \n\nNow, if the glip might NOT be tragged (Premise 2), and at least one of the options in Premise 1 MUST be true, then the only remaining possibility is that the glip is slogged.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
