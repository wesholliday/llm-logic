This means at least one of the following must be true: the clug is fleeked, or the clug is snugged.\n* **Statement 2:** The clug might not be snugged. This means it's possible the clug is not snugged.\n\nNow let's consider the possibilities:\n\n* **Possibility 1: The clug is snugged.** This possibility contradicts Statement 2, so it's not a valid scenario.\n* **Possibility 2: The clug is not snugged.** This possibility aligns with Statement 2.  Since Statement 1 tells us the clug must be either fleeked or snugged, and we've established it might not be snugged, the only remaining option is that it must be fleeked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the clug is fleeked.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
