This means there are two possibilities: \n    * The flug is blummed.\n    * The flug is zimmed.\n* **Statement 2:** The flug might not be zimmed. This tells us that it's possible the flug is NOT zimmed.\n\nNow let's consider the possibilities:\n\n* **Possibility 1:** The flug is zimmed. This contradicts Statement 2, so it can't be true.\n* **Possibility 2:** The flug is not zimmed. This aligns with Statement 2.  Since Statement 1 says it MUST be either blummed or zimmed, and we've ruled out zimmed, it must be blummed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
