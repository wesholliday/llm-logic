This presents two possibilities: (A) the flugel is blimmed, or (B) the flugel is zargled.\n* **Statement 2:** The flugel might not be zargled. This introduces uncertainty to possibility (B) from Statement 1. \n\nNow let's analyze the relationship:\n\n* If possibility (B) from Statement 1 is uncertain due to Statement 2, it weakens that possibility.\n* Weakening possibility (B) makes possibility (A) more likely, but it doesn't definitively prove it.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
