This means at least one of the following must be true: the whiffle is shanked, or the whiffle is tinked.\n* **Statement 2:** The whiffle might not be tinked. This means it's possible that the whiffle is not tinked.\n\nNow let's consider the possibilities:\n\n* **Possibility 1: The whiffle is tinked.** This possibility doesn't contradict either statement. However, it doesn't tell us if the whiffle is shanked or not.\n* **Possibility 2: The whiffle is not tinked.**  Statement 2 allows for this.  Since Statement 1 says it MUST be either shanked OR tinked, if it's NOT tinked, then it MUST be shanked.\n\nTherefore, if the whiffle might not be tinked, then it must be shanked to satisfy the first statement.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
