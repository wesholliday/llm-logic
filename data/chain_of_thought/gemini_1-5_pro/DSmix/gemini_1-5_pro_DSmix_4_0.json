This means it has to be one or the other, or possibly both.\n* **Premise 2:** The fribble might not be crinked. This tells us it's possible the fribble isn't crinked. \n\nSince the fribble might not be crinked (Premise 2), and it has to be either snurgled or crinked (Premise 1), then it must be snurgled to satisfy Premise 1.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
