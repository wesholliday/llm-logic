This means at least one of the two states (sploffed or plopped) must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The grommet might not be plopped. This introduces the possibility that the grommet is NOT plopped. \n* **Reasoning:** If the grommet might NOT be plopped (Premise 2), and at least one of the states MUST be true (Premise 1), then the only remaining possibility is that the grommet IS sploffed.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
