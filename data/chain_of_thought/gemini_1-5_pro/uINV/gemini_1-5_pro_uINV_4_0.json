This is a conditional statement, where visiting Mars is the condition, and visiting Jupiter is the result.\n\n* **The question:**  Can we infer that if the alien did *not* visit Mars, then the robot did *not* visit Jupiter? This is asking if the original statement being true forces this new statement to also be true.\n\n* **Thinking it through:**  The original statement only tells us what happens when the alien *does* visit Mars. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the alien doesn't visit Mars.  The robot could still visit Jupiter for other reasons, even if the alien never went to Mars.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
