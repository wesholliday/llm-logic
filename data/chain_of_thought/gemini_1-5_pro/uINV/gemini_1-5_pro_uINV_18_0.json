This is a conditional statement, where \"the doll was plastic\" is the hypothesis and \"the truck was metal\" is the conclusion.\n\n* **Question:** If the doll was NOT plastic, does that mean the truck was NOT metal?  We're essentially asking if negating the hypothesis automatically negates the conclusion.\n\n* **Consider a counterexample:** What if there are other situations where the truck could be metal? Maybe if the ball was red, the truck was metal. Just because the doll wasn't plastic doesn't mean the truck couldn't still be metal for a different reason.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
