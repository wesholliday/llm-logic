This is a conditional statement: If A, then B.\n\n* **Question:**  If Lisa did not buy the red shirt (not A), then Mark did not buy the blue shirt (not B). This is also a conditional statement: If not A, then not B.\n\n* **Important Note:** The original statement only tells us what happens when Lisa *does* buy the red shirt. It doesn't tell us anything about what happens if she *doesn't* buy the red shirt.  Mark might still buy the blue shirt for other reasons.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
