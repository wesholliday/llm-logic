We can represent this as: P \u2192 T\n\n* **We're asked about:** If Sam did not take a plane (not P), then Erin did not take a train (not T). This is: not P \u2192 not T\n\n* **Important:** The original statement doesn't say what happens if Sam *didn't* take a plane. Maybe Erin always takes the train, regardless of Sam's travel plans. \n\n**Answer:** no \n"
