This means whenever the dog is inside, the cat is forced outside. \n\n* **Question:** If the dog was NOT inside, does that mean the cat was NOT outside?  \n\n* **Reasoning:** Just because the dog isn't forcing the cat outside doesn't mean the cat can't be outside for other reasons. The cat could be outside by choice, even if the dog is also outside.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
