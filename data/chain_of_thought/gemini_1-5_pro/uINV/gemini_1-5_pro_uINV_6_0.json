The contrapositive of a statement is formed by switching the hypothesis and conclusion, and negating both.\n\n* **Original statement:** If P, then Q.\n* **Contrapositive:** If not Q, then not P.\n\nThe original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nLet's apply this to our problem:\n\n* **Original:** If Sue chose pizza (P), then Bob chose pasta (Q).\n* **Contrapositive:** If Bob did not choose pasta (not Q), then Sue did not choose pizza (not P).\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, and the question asks about the contrapositive, the answer is yes.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
