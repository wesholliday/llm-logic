It only tells us about the truck's color IF the car is red. It doesn't tell us anything if the car isn't red.\n\n* **Question:** If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.  This is trying to flip and negate the original statement. \n\n* **Reasoning:**  Just because the car isn't red doesn't automatically mean the truck can't be blue. The truck could be blue for other reasons unrelated to the car's color.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
