We can represent this as: P \u2192 Z\n* **We're asked about:** If Joe did not go to the park (not P), then Lucy did not go to the zoo (not Z). This is: not P \u2192 not Z\n\nThe statement \"not P \u2192 not Z\" is the inverse of the original statement \"P \u2192 Z\".  \n\n**Important:** The inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Just because the original statement might be true, it doesn't mean the inverse is automatically true.\n\n**Example:**  Maybe Lucy loves the zoo and goes every day, regardless of whether Joe goes to the park.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
