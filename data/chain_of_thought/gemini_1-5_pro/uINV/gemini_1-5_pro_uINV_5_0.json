It doesn't tell us anything about what happens if Jeff *didn't* play basketball. \n\n* **Question:** Can we infer that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis?  We need to see if this is necessarily true based on the original statement.\n\n* **Consider possibilities:**  Maybe Amy loves tennis and plays every week regardless of whether Jeff plays basketball. The original statement doesn't rule that out.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
