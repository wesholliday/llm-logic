This means the mummy being awake is dependent on the vampire being awake. \n\n* **Question:** If the vampire was NOT awake, does that mean the mummy was NOT awake? \n\n* **Reasoning:** The original statement only tells us what happens when the vampire IS awake. It doesn't say anything about what happens when the vampire is NOT awake.  The mummy could be awake for other reasons, or even by itself.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
