This means Chris finishing the race is dependent on Alex finishing the race. \n* **Question:** If Alex did *not* finish, does that mean Chris *also* did not finish?\n\nConsider this:  Maybe Chris finishes the race whether Alex does or not. The original statement only tells us what happens if Alex *does* finish. It doesn't tell us anything about what happens if Alex *doesn't* finish.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
