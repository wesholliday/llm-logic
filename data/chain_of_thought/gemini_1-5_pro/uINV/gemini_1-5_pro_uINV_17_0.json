We can represent this as: P \u2192 S\n\n* **What we want to know:** If Ben did not eat pasta (not P), then Kate did not eat salad (not S). This is: not P \u2192 not S\n\n* **The relationship:** The statement \"not P \u2192 not S\" is the inverse of the original statement \"P \u2192 S\". \n\n* **Important logic rule:** The inverse of a statement is not necessarily true even if the original statement is true. \n\n**Example:** Maybe Kate loves salad and eats it every day, regardless of what Ben eats.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
