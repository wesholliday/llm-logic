This means Sue's presence at the wedding is dependent on Mary's presence. \n\n* **Question:** If Mary was NOT at the wedding, does that mean Sue was also NOT at the wedding? \n\n* **Reasoning:** The original statement only tells us what happens if Mary WAS at the wedding. It doesn't say anything about what happens if Mary wasn't there.  Sue could have attended the wedding even without Mary.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
