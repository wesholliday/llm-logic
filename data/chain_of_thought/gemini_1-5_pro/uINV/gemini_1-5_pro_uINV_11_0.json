This doesn't tell us anything about what happens if the cake ISN'T chocolate. \n\n* **Possible scenarios:**\n    * The cake was chocolate, the muffins were blueberry (fits the rule)\n    * The cake was vanilla, the muffins were blueberry (doesn't violate the rule)\n    * The cake was vanilla, the muffins were cornbread (doesn't violate the rule)\n\n* **Key point:**  The original statement only sets a condition for when the cake IS chocolate. It doesn't restrict what can happen when the cake is NOT chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
