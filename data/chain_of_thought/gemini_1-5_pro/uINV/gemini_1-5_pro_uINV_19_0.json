We can represent this as: If F, then B.\n\n* **Question:**  If Tom did NOT watch football (not F), then can we say Jen did NOT watch basketball (not B)? This is asking: If not F, then not B.\n\n* **Consider this:** Just because Tom didn't watch football doesn't mean Jen automatically didn't watch basketball.  Maybe Jen loves basketball and watches it regardless of Tom's football viewing. \n\n* **Logical relationship:** The original statement doesn't guarantee anything about what Jen does if Tom doesn't watch football. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
