            "content": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. This is a conditional statement, where \"shirt was cotton\" is the hypothesis and \"pants were denim\" is the conclusion.\n\n* **We are asked about:** If the shirt was NOT cotton, then the pants were NOT denim. This is the inverse of the original statement.\n\n* **Important logic rule:** The inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true even if the original statement is true. \n\n**Example:** \nLet's say the original statement is true. It's possible to have a situation where:\n    * The shirt is silk (not cotton)\n    * The pants are denim. \n\nThis would still fit the original statement (if cotton shirt, then denim pants) but would make the inverse false.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
