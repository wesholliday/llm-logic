It doesn't tell us anything about what happens if the apple isn't red. \n\n* **What if the apple isn't red?** The original statement doesn't say the banana *couldn't* be yellow if the apple wasn't red.  Maybe the banana is always yellow, regardless of the apple's color!\n\n* **Can we infer the opposite?**  Because the original statement only talks about what happens when the apple IS red, we can't conclude anything about situations where the apple isn't red.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
