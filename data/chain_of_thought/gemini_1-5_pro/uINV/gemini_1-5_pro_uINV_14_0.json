This is a conditional statement, where the bear being in the cave is the *hypothesis* and the wolf being in the den is the *conclusion*.\n\n* **We are asked about:** If the bear was NOT in the cave, then the wolf was NOT in the den. This is the *inverse* of the original statement.\n\n* **Important logic rule:** The inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true even if the original statement is true. \n\n**Example:** \nLet's say the original statement is true.  Maybe the wolf always goes to the den when the bear is in the cave. However, the wolf might go to the den for other reasons too! Just because the bear isn't in the cave doesn't automatically mean the wolf isn't in the den.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
