This means the presence of the griffin guarantees the presence of the unicorn. \n\n* **Question:** Does the absence of the griffin guarantee the absence of the unicorn?\n\nNot necessarily. The original statement only tells us about what happens when the griffin IS in the forest. It doesn't say anything about what happens when the griffin IS NOT in the forest. The unicorn could still be in the forest even if the griffin isn't.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
