            "content": "Explanation: The original statement tells us two things must have happened: the concert sold out AND the concert started at 8 PM.  The question asks if we can know one of those things must have happened (the concert started at 8 PM) without the other thing necessarily happening (the concert being sold out).  Since the original statement links the two events with \"and\", we know they both must happen, and thus one can happen without the other.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
