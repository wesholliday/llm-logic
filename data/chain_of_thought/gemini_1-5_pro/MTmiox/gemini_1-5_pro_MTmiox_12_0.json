This means it's possible the smip didn't lup the zoint, but it doesn't tell us for sure.\n\n* **Statement 2:** If the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint. This tells us shripping the smip guarantees lupping the zoint.\n\nNow let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The smip was not shripped\"?\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nIf the smip *was* shripped, then according to Statement 2, it must have lupped the zoint. However, Statement 1 says the smip *might not* have lupped the zoint.  These statements create a contradiction if the smip was shripped. \n\nTo avoid the contradiction, the smip couldn't have been shripped.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
