The first statement says it's possible the cat didn't eat the fish. These ideas clash.\n* **To avoid the contradiction:**  The only way both statements can be true is if the cat wasn't hungry. If the cat wasn't hungry, then it's possible it didn't eat the fish, and the second statement (which only applies if the cat WAS hungry) doesn't contradict anything.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
