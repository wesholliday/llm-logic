This means there's a possibility the twonk was varnished, and a possibility it wasn't.\n* **Statement 2:** If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished. This tells us plinking leads to varnishing.\n\nNow let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The twonk was not plinked\"?\n\n* If the twonk WAS plinked, statement 2 tells us it MUST have been varnished. \n* However, statement 1 leaves open the possibility that the twonk was NOT varnished. \n* These two possibilities clash. Therefore...\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
