This means it's possible the smonk plagged, and it's possible it didn't. \n* **Statement 2:** If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged. This tells us vreebling leads to plagging.\n\nNow let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The smonk was not vreebled\"?\n\n* **Scenario 1:** If the smonk WAS vreebled, then it MUST have plagged (from statement 2). This scenario doesn't contradict our information.\n* **Scenario 2:** If the smonk WAS NOT vreebled, we have no information about whether it plagged or not. This scenario also doesn't contradict our information.\n\nSince both scenarios are possible, we cannot definitively say the smonk was not vreebled.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
