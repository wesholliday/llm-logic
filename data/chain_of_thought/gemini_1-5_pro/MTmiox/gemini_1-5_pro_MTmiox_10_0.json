This means it's possible the wug was garpled, and it's also possible it wasn't. \n* **Statement 2:** If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled. This tells us being sproinged guarantees being garpled.\n\nNow let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The wug was not sproinged\"?\n\n* If the wug WAS sproinged, then according to statement 2, it MUST have been garpled. \n* However, statement 1 says the wug MIGHT NOT have been garpled.\n* These two statements create a conflict if the wug was sproinged.\n\nTo avoid the conflict, the only possibility left is that the wug was NOT sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
