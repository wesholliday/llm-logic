This means it's possible the clug wasn't snugged, but doesn't guarantee it.\n* **Statement 2:** If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged. This sets up a conditional relationship: fleeked clug --> snugged clug.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The clug was not fleeked.\"\n\nConsider this: If the clug wasn't snugged (possible from Statement 1), then Statement 2 tells us it couldn't have been fleeked.  This is because a fleeked clug *requires* a snugged clug.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
