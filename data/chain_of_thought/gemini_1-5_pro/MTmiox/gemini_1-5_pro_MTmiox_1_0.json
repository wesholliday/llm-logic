This means it's possible the flugel wasn't zargled, but doesn't guarantee it. \n* **Statement 2:** If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled. This is a conditional statement, where blimmed being true guarantees zargled is also true.\n\nNow let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The flugel was not blimmed\"?\n\n* If the flugel WAS blimmed, then statement 2 tells us it MUST have been zargled. \n* However, statement 1 says it's possible the flugel WASN'T zargled.\n* These two statements clash if we assume the flugel was blimmed. \n\nTherefore...\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
