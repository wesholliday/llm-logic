This means it's possible the flob movated, and it's possible it didn't. \n* **Premise 2:** If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated. This tells us skizzled flobs always movate.\n\nNow let's consider the conclusion:\n\n* **Conclusion:** The flob was not skizzled.\n\nCan we be certain of this? If the flob WAS skizzled, then according to Premise 2, it MUST have movated.  This contradicts the possibility in Premise 1 that the flob did NOT movate. \n\nTherefore, to avoid a contradiction, the flob couldn't have been skizzled.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
