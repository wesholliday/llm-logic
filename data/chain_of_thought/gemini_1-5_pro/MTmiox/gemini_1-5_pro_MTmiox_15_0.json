This means it's possible the dreb was not spened, but doesn't guarantee it.\n\n* **Statement 2:** If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened. This tells us vroombing the dreb always leads to it being spened.\n\nNow let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The dreb was not vroombed\"?\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* We know the dreb might not have been spened (from Statement 1). \n* We also know that if it WAS vroombed, it MUST have been spened (from Statement 2).\n* Therefore, if the dreb wasn't spened, it couldn't have been vroombed.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
