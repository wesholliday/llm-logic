This means it's possible the whiffle didn't tink, but it doesn't tell us for sure.\n* **Premise 2:** If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked. This is a conditional statement, telling us what happens if the whiffle was shanked.\n\nNow let's consider the conclusion we're trying to reach:\n\n* **Conclusion:** The whiffle was not shanked.\n\nIf the whiffle *was* shanked, then according to Premise 2, it must have tinked. However, Premise 1 tells us it's possible the whiffle *didn't* tink.  This creates a contradiction if we assume the whiffle was shanked. \n\nTo avoid the contradiction, we must conclude that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
