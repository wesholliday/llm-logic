            "content": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n* **Statement 1:** The sprocket might not have been daggled. This means it's possible the sprocket was daggled, and it's also possible it wasn't. \n\n* **Statement 2:** If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled. This tells us cranking the sprocket guarantees it was daggled.\n\nNow let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The sprocket was not cranked\"?\n\n* **Reasoning:** If the sprocket *was* cranked, statement 2 tells us it must have been daggled. However, statement 1 leaves open the possibility that the sprocket was *not* daggled.  Since these statements could contradict if the sprocket was cranked, the sprocket couldn't have been cranked.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
