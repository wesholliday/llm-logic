This means it's possible the fleeg was surned, and it's also possible it wasn't. \n\n* **Statement 2:** If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned. This tells us that being bluttered guarantees being surned.\n\nNow let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The fleeg was not bluttered\"?\n\nReasoning:\n\n* If the fleeg WAS bluttered, then statement 2 tells us it MUST have been surned.\n* However, statement 1 leaves open the possibility that the fleeg was NOT surned. \n* These two possibilities clash. The only way to resolve this is if the initial assumption (that the fleeg was bluttered) is false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
