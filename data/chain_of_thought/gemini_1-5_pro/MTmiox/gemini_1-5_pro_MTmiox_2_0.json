This means it's possible the wug didn't bim the zoint, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that it did.\n\n* **Statement 2:** If the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint. This sets up a conditional relationship: flooped wug --> bimmed zoint.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude:\n\n* **Conclusion:** The wug was not flooped.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n* **Possibility 1: The wug was flooped.** If this is true, then according to Statement 2, the wug must have bimmed the zoint. This would contradict Statement 1, which allows for the possibility that the wug didn't bim the zoint. \n\n* **Possibility 2: The wug was not flooped.** This possibility aligns with both statements.  Statement 1 doesn't depend on whether the wug was flooped or not. Statement 2 only requires the wug to have bimmed the zoint *if* it was flooped.\n\nSince Possibility 1 leads to a contradiction, the only valid possibility is Possibility 2.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
