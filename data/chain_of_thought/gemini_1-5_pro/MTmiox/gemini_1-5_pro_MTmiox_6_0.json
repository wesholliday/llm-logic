This means it's possible the grommet didn't plop the frink, but doesn't guarantee it. \n* **Statement 2:** If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink. This is a conditional statement, setting up a rule.\n\nNow let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The grommet was not sploffed\"?\n\n* If the grommet WAS sploffed, then according to statement 2, it MUST have plopped the frink. \n* However, statement 1 says it's possible the grommet DID NOT plop the frink.\n* These two statements create a contradiction IF the grommet was sploffed.\n\nTo avoid the contradiction, the only option is that the grommet was NOT sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
