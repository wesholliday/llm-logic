This means it's possible the fribble crinkled, and it's possible it didn't. \n* **Statement 2:** If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinkled. This tells us snurgling leads to crinkling.\n\nNow let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The fribble was not snurgled\"?\n\n* If the fribble *was* snurgled, it *must* have crinkled (from statement 2).\n* But statement 1 says the fribble *might not* have crinkled.\n* These two statements clash if the fribble was snurgled. \n\nTherefore...\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
