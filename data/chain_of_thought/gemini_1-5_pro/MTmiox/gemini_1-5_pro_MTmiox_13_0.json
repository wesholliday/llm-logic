This means it's possible the glip tragged, and it's also possible the glip did *not* trag.\n* **Premise 2:** If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged. This tells us slogging leads to tragging.\n* **Conclusion:** The glip was not slogged. \n\nNow let's see if the conclusion follows:\n\n* If the glip *was* slogged, then it *must* have tragged (Premise 2). \n* But Premise 1 says the glip *might not* have tragged. \n* These two statements clash. The only way to resolve this is if the glip was NOT slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
