To prove the conclusion (the zinger wasn't fraggled), we can use the contrapositive of Premise 2. \n\nThe contrapositive flips and negates the conditional statement: \"If NOT smuggled, then NOT fraggled\".\n\nHowever, Premise 1 only says the zinger \"might not\" have been smuggled. It doesn't definitively say it wasn't smuggled.  Therefore, we cannot confidently apply the contrapositive to reach the conclusion.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
