The question is whether we can combine these to say \"The wumble must be gronk for a flibbit and zooble\".  The word \"and\" implies that both the flibbit and the wumble itself need to be zooble. However, the original statement only states that \"it\" must be zooble. It is not clear whether \"it\" refers to the wumble or the flibbit. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
