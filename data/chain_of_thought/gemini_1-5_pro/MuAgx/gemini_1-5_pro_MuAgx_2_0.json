            "content": "Explanation: We are asked if we can remove the second \"must\" from the original statement without changing the meaning. The first statement says two things MUST be true: 1) the gronk is on the flonk, and 2) the gronk zazzles a plimp flim.  The second statement says the gronk MUST be on the flonk, and ALSO says that the gronk zazzles a plimp flim. This doesn't mean the gronk zazzling a plimp flim is mandatory.  Since the second statement doesn't require the zazzling, the meaning is different. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
