It could be crinked, or it might not be.\n\n* **\"Either the fribble must be crinked or it is snurgled\"**: This presents two possibilities, and at least one MUST be true.\n\nNow let's combine the information:\n\n* We know the fribble doesn't HAVE to be crinked. \n* We know the fribble MUST be either crinked OR snurgled.\n\nSince the first option (crinked) isn't mandatory, the second option (snurgled) must be true to satisfy the \"either/or\" statement.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
