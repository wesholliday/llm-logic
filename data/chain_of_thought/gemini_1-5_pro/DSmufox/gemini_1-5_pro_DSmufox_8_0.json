It could be daggled, or it could be something else.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked.\"** This gives us two possibilities:\n    * The sprocket is daggled.\n    * The sprocket is cranked.\n\n* **Our Goal: Can we infer \"The sprocket is cranked\"?**\n\nNow let's combine the information:\n\n* Statement 1 tells us the sprocket *doesn't have* to be daggled. \n* Statement 2 tells us if it's *not* daggled, it *must* be cranked.\n\nTherefore...\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
