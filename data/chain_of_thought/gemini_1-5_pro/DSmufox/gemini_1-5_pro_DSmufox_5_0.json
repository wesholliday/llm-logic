It could be smoogled, or it might not be.\n\n* **Premise 2:** \"Either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled.\" This gives us two possibilities: smoogled or fraggled.\n\n* **Putting them together:** Premise 1 tells us the zinger doesn't *have* to be smoogled.  Premise 2 tells us it's either smoogled OR fraggled. Since it doesn't HAVE to be smoogled, the only remaining option is that it's fraggled.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
