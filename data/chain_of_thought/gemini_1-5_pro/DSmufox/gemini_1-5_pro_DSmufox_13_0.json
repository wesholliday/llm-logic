It could be untragged.\n\n2. **\"Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged\"**: This gives us two possibilities:\n    * The glip is tragged.\n    * The glip is slogged.\n\n3. We know from the first statement that the glip doesn't *have* to be tragged. \n\n4. Therefore, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
