It could be spened, or it could be something else.\n\n* **Premise 2:** \"Either the dreb must be spened or it is vroombed.\" This gives us two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n\n* **Putting them together:** Since Premise 1 tells us the dreb doesn't *have* to be spened, and Premise 2 says it must be either spened OR vroombed, the only remaining possibility is that the dreb is vroombed.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
