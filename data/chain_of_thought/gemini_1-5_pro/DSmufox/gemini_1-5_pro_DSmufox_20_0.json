We don't know for sure.\n\n* **Premise 2:** Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered.\n    * This presents two possibilities, and at least one of them must be true.\n\n* **Goal:** Determine if we can definitively say \"The fleeg is bluttered.\"\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nSince the fleeg doesn't *have* to be surned (from Premise 1), Premise 2 still holds true if the fleeg is bluttered.  We don't have enough information to rule out the possibility that the fleeg is both NOT surned AND bluttered.\n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
