We don't know for sure.\n\n* **Premise 2:** Either the sneg must be sproted or it is crampled.\n    * This gives us two possibilities: sproted or crampled.\n\n* **Putting it together:** Premise 1 tells us the sneg doesn't *have* to be sproted.  Premise 2 tells us it has to be one or the other. Since it doesn't have to be sproted, the only option left is that it must be crampled.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
