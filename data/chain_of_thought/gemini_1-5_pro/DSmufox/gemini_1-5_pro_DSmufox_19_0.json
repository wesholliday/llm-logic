It could be unplagged.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled.\"** This gives us two possibilities: the smonk is plagged, or the smonk is vreebled.\n\n* **Putting them together:** We know the smonk doesn't *have* to be plagged (from statement 1).  Statement 2 tells us it has to be either plagged OR vreebled. Since it doesn't have to be plagged, the only remaining option is that it must be vreebled.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
