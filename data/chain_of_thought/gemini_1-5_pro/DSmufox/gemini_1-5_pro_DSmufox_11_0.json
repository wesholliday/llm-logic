It's not a requirement.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"Either the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed\"**\n   This presents two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n\nNow let's consider the possibilities:\n\n* **Possibility 1: The flug is zimmed.**  This would make Statement 2 true, but it doesn't contradict Statement 1 because Statement 1 doesn't rule out the flug being zimmed.\n\n* **Possibility 2: The flug is blummed.** This also makes Statement 2 true.  Since Statement 1 doesn't say anything about the flug being blummed, this possibility is also allowed.\n\nSince we have at least one possibility where \"The flug is blummed\" is true, and this doesn't contradict our given information, we can infer the statement could be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
