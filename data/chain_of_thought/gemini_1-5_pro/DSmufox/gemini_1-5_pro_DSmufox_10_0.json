It's not a certainty.\n\n* **\"Either the wug must be garpled or it is sproinged\"**: This presents two possibilities, and at least one of them must be true.\n\nNow let's consider the possibilities:\n\n1. **The wug is garpled**: This is allowed by the first statement, but it doesn't automatically tell us anything about whether the wug is sproinged or not.\n\n2. **The wug is not garpled**:  Since the second statement says it MUST be either garpled OR sproinged, if it's not garpled, then it MUST be sproinged.\n\nTherefore, because the wug doesn't HAVE to be garpled, it must be sproinged to satisfy the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
