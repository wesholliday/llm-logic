However, if this is true, then Premise 2 is also true (since it allows for the grommet to be plopped).\n* **Possibility 2: The grommet is not plopped.**  If this is true, then Premise 2 tells us the grommet MUST be sploffed (since one of the two options in Premise 2 must be true).\n\nTherefore, whether or not the grommet is plopped, we can definitively conclude that the grommet is sploffed.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
