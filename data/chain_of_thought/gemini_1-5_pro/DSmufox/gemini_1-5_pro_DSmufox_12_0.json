It could be lupped, or it might not be.\n\n2. **\"Either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped\"** presents two options, and at least one must be true.\n\n3. Since we know from the first statement that the smip doesn't *have* to be lupped, the second statement tells us it *must* be shripped to fulfill the \"either/or\" condition. \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
