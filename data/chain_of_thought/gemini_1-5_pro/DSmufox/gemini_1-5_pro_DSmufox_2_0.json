There's a possibility it's NOT bimmed.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"Either the wug must be bimmed or it is flooped\"**\n    * This presents two options, and at least one MUST be true.\n\nNow let's combine the information:\n\n* We know from Statement 1 that the wug doesn't HAVE to be bimmed. \n* But Statement 2 says it has to be either bimmed OR flooped.\n* Since bimming isn't mandatory (from Statement 1), the only way to satisfy Statement 2 is if the wug is flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
