However, the sentence structure tells us that a flump could have two potential things happen to it: being gronked and being shimbled.  The question asks if, given that a flump *might* be both, can we infer that it *might* be just one of those things. Since the original statement says the flump could be BOTH, it must also be possible for the flump to experience either one individually. \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
