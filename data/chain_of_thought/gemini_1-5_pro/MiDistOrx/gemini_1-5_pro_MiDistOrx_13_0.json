It's possible the gronk is in one, the other, or some combination of both. The second sentence breaks this down into two separate possibilities: the gronk might be in frozz, or the gronk might be in zibber. This doesn't contradict the original statement, as it simply breaks down the initial possibilities. \nAnswer: yes \n"
