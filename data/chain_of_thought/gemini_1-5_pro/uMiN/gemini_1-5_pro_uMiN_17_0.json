This means there's a possibility it's not in the backpack.\n* **Question:** Can we infer it's *not the case* that the scarf *must* be stuffed in my backpack?  \"Not the case\" means it's false. \"Must\" implies certainty. \n\nSince the original statement allows for the possibility of the scarf NOT being in the backpack, we can indeed say it's not certain the scarf IS in the backpack.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
