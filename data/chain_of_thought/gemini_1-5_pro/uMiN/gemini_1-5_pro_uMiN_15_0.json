This means there's a possibility they aren't in the closet, but it's not certain.\n* **Question:** Can we infer that it's *not* the case that the shoes *must* be in the closet?  In other words, are we sure the shoes are NOT required to be in the closet?\n\nSince the original statement leaves open the possibility that the shoes are NOT in the closet, we can indeed infer that they are not required to be there.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
