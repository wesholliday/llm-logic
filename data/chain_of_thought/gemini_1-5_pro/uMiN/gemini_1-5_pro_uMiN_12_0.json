This means it's possible the jacket is NOT on the chair.\n* **Question:** Can we infer it's *not the case* that the jacket *must* be on the chair?  In other words, are we sure the jacket is NOT required to be on the chair?\n\nSince the statement tells us the jacket doesn't have to be on the chair, we can be sure it's not required to be there.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
