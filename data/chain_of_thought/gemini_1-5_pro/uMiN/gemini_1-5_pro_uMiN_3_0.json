This means there's a possibility James didn't write it, but it doesn't confirm it.\n* **Question:** Can we infer that it's not the case that the book MUST have been written by James?  We're asking if we can conclude that it's not absolutely certain James wrote the book.\n\nSince the original statement leaves open the possibility that James didn't write the book, we can indeed infer that it's not a certainty he did. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
