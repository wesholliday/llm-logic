This means it's possible they are not in her bag, but it's not certain. \n* **Question:** Can we infer that it's *not the case* that the sunglasses *must* be in her bag?  This is asking if we can conclude that the sunglasses are definitely NOT required to be in her bag.\n\nSince the original statement leaves open the possibility that the sunglasses are in the bag, we cannot definitively say they *must* be in there. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
