This leaves open the possibility of the keys being in the drawer under various conditions (on a keychain, loose, etc.).\n* **Statement 2:** The keys might be on a keychain. This also leaves open the possibility of the keychain being in various locations (in the drawer, on a hook, etc.).\n\nTo infer that \"The keys might be in the drawer on a keychain,\" both possibilities (keys in the drawer and keys on a keychain) need to occur simultaneously. While both statements individually allow for this combined possibility, they don't guarantee it. \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
