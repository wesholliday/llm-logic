It's possible the cat is in the garden but not sleeping, sleeping but not in the garden, or both sleeping and in the garden.  The inference combines these possibilities, suggesting the cat could be both sleeping and in the garden, which is a valid combination of the original possibilities. \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
