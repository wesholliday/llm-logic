If we can find even one scenario where this is the case, then the inference is not valid. \n\nConsider the scenario where the fish is in a bag of water, not yet released into the aquarium. The fish could be swimming in the bag. In this case, both parts of the first statement are true, but the second statement is false.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
