This sets up a conditional statement:  sproinged wug --> garpled wug.\n* **Premise 2:** The wug was sproinged. This tells us the condition in Premise 1 is met.\n\nSince we know the wug was sproinged (meeting the condition), and Premise 1 tells us a sproinged wug is a garpled wug, we can conclude...\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
