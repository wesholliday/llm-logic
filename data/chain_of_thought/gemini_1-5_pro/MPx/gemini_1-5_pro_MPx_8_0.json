(This is a conditional statement, like \"If A, then B\")\n* **Premise 2:** The sprocket was cranked. (This tells us \"A\" is true)\n* **Conclusion:** The sprocket was daggled. (We want to know if we can conclude \"B\")\n\nThis follows a classic logical structure called *Modus Ponens*. If we have \"If A, then B\" and we know \"A\" is true, then \"B\" must also be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
