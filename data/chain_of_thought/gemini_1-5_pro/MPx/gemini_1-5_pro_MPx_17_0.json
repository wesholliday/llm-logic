If we have a statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" and we know that \"P\" is true, then we can definitively conclude that \"Q\" is also true.\n\n* **P:** The flob was skizzled.\n* **Q:** The flob movated.\n\nSince we have both \"If P, then Q\" and \"P\" as true statements, we can conclude \"Q\".\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
