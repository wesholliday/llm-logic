We don't know if it's true or not inherently.\n    * \"then the smip lupped the zoint\" = This is the result that happens *if* the condition is true.\n* **Apply the given information:** We are told \"The smip was shripped.\" This means our condition is met.\n* **Conclude:** Since the condition is met, the result must be true as well.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
