We need to focus on the structure of the statements.\n\n* **Think of it like a cause and effect relationship.**  \"If [something happens], then [something else happens].\"\n\n* **We're given two pieces of information:**\n    *  \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\" This sets up the rule.\n    * \"The fleeg was bluttered.\" This tells us the first part of the rule happened.\n\n* **Since the first part of the rule happened, the second part must also happen.**\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
