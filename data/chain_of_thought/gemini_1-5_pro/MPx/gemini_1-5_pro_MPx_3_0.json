This sets up a conditional relationship:  morphing leads to quanking.\n* **Premise 2:** The splat was morphed. This tells us the condition in Premise 1 is met.\n\nSince the condition (morphing) is met, and Premise 1 says morphing leads to quanking, we can conclude that the splat quanked.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
