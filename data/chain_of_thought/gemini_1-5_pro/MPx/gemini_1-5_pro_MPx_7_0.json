(This is a conditional statement, like saying \"If it rains, then the ground is wet\".)\n* **Premise 2:** The whiffle was shanked. \n* **Conclusion:** The whiffle tinked.\n\nThis follows a logical structure called *modus ponens*. If we have a rule (If A, then B) and we know A is true, then B must also be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
