It doesn't tell us anything actually happened, just what WOULD happen IF something else did.\n* **We're given new information:** \"The wug was flooped\" confirms the first part of our hypothetical is true.\n* **Following the logic:** Since the condition in the hypothetical is met, the outcome should also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
