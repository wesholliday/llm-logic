This is a classic \"if-then\" statement.\n* **Premise 2:** The flugel was blimmed. This tells us the \"if\" part of our first statement is true.\n* **Conclusion:** The flugel was zargled.  Since the \"if\" part of our first statement is true, and the first statement links \"blimmed\" and \"zargled\", the \"then\" part must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
