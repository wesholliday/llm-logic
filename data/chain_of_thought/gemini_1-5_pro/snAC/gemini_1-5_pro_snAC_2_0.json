Here's why that's not the case:\n\n* Statement 1 only tells us what happens *if* the griffin is in the forest. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the griffin is *not* in the forest. \n* It's possible the unicorn is in the forest for other reasons, completely unrelated to the griffin.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
