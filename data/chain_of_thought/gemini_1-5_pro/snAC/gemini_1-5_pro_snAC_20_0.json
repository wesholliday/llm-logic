It doesn't tell us anything definitive if the apple isn't red.\n* **We know the second part is true:** \"The banana was yellow\" is confirmed.\n* **The question is:** Does the banana being yellow automatically mean the apple MUST have been red?\n\nConsider this: What if the apple was green, but the banana was still yellow? The original statement doesn't say anything about that possibility being impossible. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
