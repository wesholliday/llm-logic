This is a conditional statement: If P, then Q.\n    * Lucy went to the zoo (Q is true).\n\n* **The question is:** Does Joe going to the park (P) have to be true?\n\n* **Consider this:**  Just because Lucy went to the zoo doesn't mean Joe *had* to go to the park. Maybe Lucy goes to the zoo all the time, regardless of Joe's park visits. The original statement only tells us what happens if Joe goes to the park, not what happens if Lucy goes to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
