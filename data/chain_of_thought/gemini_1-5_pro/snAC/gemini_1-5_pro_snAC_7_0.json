This is a conditional statement.\n    * Chris finished the race (C) is true.\n\n* **We need to determine:** Does Alex finishing the race (A) have to be true?\n\n* **Consider this:** The original statement (If A, then C) is only false if A is true and C is false.  Since we know C is true, the original statement holds true regardless of whether A is true or false.\n\n* **Example:**  Let's say Chris finished the race, but Alex did not. The original statement (If A, then C) is still true. It doesn't say that Chris *only* finishes the race if Alex does.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
