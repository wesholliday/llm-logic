This is a conditional statement.\n    * Jen watched basketball (B is true).\n\n* **The question is:** Does this mean Tom MUST have watched football (is F necessarily true)?\n\n* **Consider this:**  A conditional statement (If F, then B) is only false if F is true and B is false. \n\n* **In our case:** B is true. This means the conditional statement (If F, then B) holds true regardless of whether F is true or false.\n\n* **Therefore:** We cannot definitively say that Tom watched football. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
