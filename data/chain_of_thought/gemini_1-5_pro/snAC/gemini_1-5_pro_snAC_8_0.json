(Let's call this statement A \u2192 B)\n    * The mummy was awake. (Let's call this statement B)\n\n* **We want to know:** Does it necessarily follow that the vampire was awake? (Is statement A true?)\n\n* **Consider this:** The original statement (A \u2192 B) only tells us what happens if the vampire IS awake. It doesn't tell us anything about what happens if the vampire is NOT awake. \n\n* **Example:**  Maybe the mummy always wakes up first.  The mummy being awake doesn't automatically mean the vampire is also awake.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
