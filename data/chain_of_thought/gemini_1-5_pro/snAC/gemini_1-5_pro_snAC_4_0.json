Just because the consequence of a conditional statement is true, it doesn't mean the original condition is also true. \n\n**Example:** If it's raining (condition), then the ground is wet (consequence).  You can have wet ground without it raining (e.g., someone used a sprinkler).\n\nSimilarly, the robot might have visited Jupiter for reasons other than the alien visiting Mars. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
