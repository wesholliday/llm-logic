In other words, if Jeff played basketball, Amy *must* have played tennis. \n* **We're also given:** \"Amy played tennis\" is true.\n\nHowever, this doesn't automatically mean Jeff played basketball.  Just because Amy playing tennis is *necessary* for Jeff to have played basketball, it doesn't mean it's *sufficient*.  \n\n**Example:**  Maybe Amy always plays tennis, regardless of whether Jeff plays basketball or not.\n\nTherefore, we can't definitively say Jeff played basketball.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
