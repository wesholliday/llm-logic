This presents two possibilities.\n* **Premise 2:** The toy might not be sitting on the shelf. This introduces uncertainty about one of the possibilities from Premise 1. \n* **Conclusion:** The toy is in the toy box. The argument attempts to conclude this based on the uncertainty introduced in Premise 2.\n\nHere's why this isn't logically valid:\n\nJust because the toy *might* not be on the shelf doesn't automatically mean it *must* be in the toy box. There could be other places the toy could be. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
