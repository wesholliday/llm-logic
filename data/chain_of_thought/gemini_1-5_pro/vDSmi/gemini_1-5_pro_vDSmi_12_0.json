This presents two possibilities, and claims at least one must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The jacket might not be hanging in the closet. This introduces uncertainty about one of the possibilities from Premise 1. \n* **Conclusion:** The jacket is draped over the chair. The argument concludes that since one possibility might be false, the other must be true.\n\nHowever, Premise 2 only introduces uncertainty (\"might not\"). It doesn't definitively rule out the possibility of the jacket being in the closet.  Therefore, even if the jacket might not be in the closet, it doesn't automatically mean it MUST be on the chair. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
