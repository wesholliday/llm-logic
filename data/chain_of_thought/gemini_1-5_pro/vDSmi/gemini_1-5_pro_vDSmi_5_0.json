This presents two possibilities, and claims at least one must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry. This introduces uncertainty about one of the possibilities from Premise 1. \n* **Conclusion:** The cookies are in the jar. The argument concludes that because one possibility is uncertain, the other must be true.\n\nHowever, this reasoning is flawed. Just because the cookies *might* not be in the pantry doesn't automatically mean they *are* in the jar. There could be other places the cookies are located.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
