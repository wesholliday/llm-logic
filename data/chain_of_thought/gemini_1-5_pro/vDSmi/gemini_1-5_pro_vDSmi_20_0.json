This presents two possibilities, only one of which needs to be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The sunglasses MIGHT NOT be perched on her head. This introduces uncertainty about one of the possibilities, but doesn't rule it out completely. \n\nNow, the key to validity is whether the conclusion *must* be true if the premises are true.  While the sunglasses being in the bag is *possible* given the premises, Premise 2 doesn't definitively eliminate the other option (sunglasses on her head). \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
