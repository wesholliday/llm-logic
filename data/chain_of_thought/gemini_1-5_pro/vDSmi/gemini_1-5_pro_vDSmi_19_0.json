This presents two possibilities, and claims at least one must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The watch might not be on his wrist. This introduces uncertainty about one of the possibilities from Premise 1. \n* **Conclusion:** The watch is charging on the dresser. The argument attempts to conclude that because one possibility is uncertain, the other *must* be true.\n\nHowever, this reasoning is flawed. Just because the watch *might* not be on his wrist doesn't automatically mean it *is* charging on the dresser. There could be other locations or situations not mentioned.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
