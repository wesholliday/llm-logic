This presents two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand. This introduces uncertainty about one of the possibilities from Premise 1. \n* **Conclusion:** The notebook is in the drawer. The argument concludes that because one possibility is uncertain, the other must be true.\n\nHowever, this reasoning is flawed. Just because the notebook *might not* be on the nightstand doesn't automatically mean it *is* in the drawer. There could be other locations for the notebook.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
