This presents two possibilities, and claims at least one must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet. This introduces uncertainty about one of the possibilities from Premise 1. \n* **Conclusion:** The umbrella is in the car. The argument concludes that because one possibility is uncertain, the other *must* be true.\n\nThis reasoning is flawed.  Just because we are unsure if the umbrella is in the closet doesn't automatically mean it *must* be in the car. There could be other places the umbrella could be.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
