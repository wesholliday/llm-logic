This presents two possibilities, and claims at least one must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The pen might not be on my desk. This introduces uncertainty about one of the possibilities from Premise 1. \n* **Conclusion:** The pen is in my bag. The argument concludes that because one possibility is uncertain, the other *must* be true.\n\nHere's why this reasoning is flawed:\n\nPremise 2 only tells us it's *possible* the pen isn't on the desk. It doesn't rule out the possibility that the pen *is* on the desk.  Both the pen being in the bag AND the pen being on the desk could be true at the same time.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
