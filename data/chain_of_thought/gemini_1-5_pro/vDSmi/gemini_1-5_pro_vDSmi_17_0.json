This presents two possibilities, only one of which needs to be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The scarf MIGHT NOT be on the coat rack. This introduces uncertainty about one of the possibilities, but doesn't rule it out completely. \n\nSince the second premise doesn't definitively eliminate the possibility of the scarf being on the coat rack, we can't definitively conclude that it MUST be in the backpack.  The scarf could still be on the coat rack, even if it \"might not\" be.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
