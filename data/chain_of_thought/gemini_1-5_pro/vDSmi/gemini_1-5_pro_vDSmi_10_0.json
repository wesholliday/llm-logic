This presents two possibilities.\n* **Premise 2:** The missing sock might not be under the bed. This casts doubt on one of the possibilities from Premise 1.\n* **Conclusion:** The missing sock is in the laundry basket. The argument concludes that because one possibility is weakened, the other must be true.\n\nThis reasoning is flawed.  Just because the sock *might* not be under the bed doesn't automatically mean it *is* in the laundry basket. There could be other places the sock could be.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
