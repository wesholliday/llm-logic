This presents two possibilities.\n* **Premise 2:** The remote MIGHT NOT be under the couch. This doesn't rule out the possibility that it IS under the couch. \n* **Conclusion:** The remote is on the coffee table. \n\nThe issue is that Premise 2 doesn't eliminate one of the possibilities presented in Premise 1.  Even if the remote might not be under the couch, it doesn't automatically mean it MUST be on the coffee table. There could be other places the remote could be.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
