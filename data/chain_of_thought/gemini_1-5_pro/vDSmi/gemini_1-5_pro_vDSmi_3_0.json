This presents two possibilities.\n* **Premise 2:** The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet. This casts doubt on one of the possibilities from Premise 1.\n* **Conclusion:** The keys are in the drawer. The argument concludes that because one possibility is weakened, the other must be true.\n\n**Reasoning:** This argument structure is flawed. Just because one possibility is weakened doesn't automatically make the other possibility true. There could be other places the keys could be. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
