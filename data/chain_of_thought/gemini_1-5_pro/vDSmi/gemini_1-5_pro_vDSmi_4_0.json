This presents two possibilities, and claims at least one must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The cat might not be playing in the bedroom. This introduces uncertainty about one of the possibilities from Premise 1. \n* **Conclusion:** The cat is napping on the couch. The argument attempts to conclude this based on the uncertainty introduced in Premise 2.\n\nHere's why this is not logically valid:\n\nJust because one possibility *might* be false, doesn't automatically make the other possibility true.  The cat could be doing something else entirely! \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
