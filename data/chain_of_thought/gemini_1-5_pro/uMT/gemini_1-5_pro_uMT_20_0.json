Premise 2 tells us Q is false.  To determine if we can infer that the apple was not red, consider this:\n\nIf the original statement (\"If P, then Q\") is true, and we know Q is false, then P must also be false. This is because if P were true, then Q would have to be true as well.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
