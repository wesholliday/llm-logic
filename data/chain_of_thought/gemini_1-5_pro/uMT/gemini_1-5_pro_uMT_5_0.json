Modus Tollens states: If P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\nLet's apply this to our problem:\n\n* **P:** Jeff played basketball\n* **Q:** Amy played tennis\n\nStatement 1 tells us P implies Q. Statement 2 tells us Q is false. Therefore, according to Modus Tollens, P (Jeff played basketball) must also be false.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
