Modus Tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know the consequent is false (not Q), then we can infer the antecedent is also false (not P).\n\n* In our case, P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel.\" \n* We are given \"not Q\" (the book is not a mystery novel). \n* Therefore, we can conclude \"not P\" (the book was not written by James).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
