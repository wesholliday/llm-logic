Modus Tollens states that if a conditional statement (If P, then Q) is true, and the consequent (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\n* In our case:\n    * P: The vampire was awake.\n    * Q: The mummy was awake.\n\n* We know Statement 1 is true, and Statement 2 tells us Q is false. \n* Therefore, using Modus Tollens, we can conclude that P (the vampire was awake) must also be false.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
