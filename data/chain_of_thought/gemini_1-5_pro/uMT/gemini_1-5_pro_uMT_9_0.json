Modus Tollens states that if a conditional statement (If P, then Q) is true, and the consequent (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\nApplying this to our problem:\n\n* **P:** Lisa bought the red shirt.\n* **Q:** Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nStatement 1 tells us \"If P, then Q\". Statement 2 tells us \"Q is false\". Therefore, using Modus Tollens, we can conclude that \"P is false\".\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
