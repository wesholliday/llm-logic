Statement 1 tells us that the alien visiting Mars is a condition that would lead to the robot visiting Jupiter.  Statement 2 tells us the robot did *not* visit Jupiter.  This means the condition that would have led to the robot visiting Jupiter (the alien visiting Mars) must also be false.\n\n**Answer: Yes** \n"
