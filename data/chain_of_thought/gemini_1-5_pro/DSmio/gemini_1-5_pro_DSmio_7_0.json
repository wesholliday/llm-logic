This means it's possible the umbrella is NOT in the closet, but it doesn't tell us where it IS.\n* **Statement 2:** Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet. This presents two options, and at least one MUST be true.\n\nNow let's combine the information:\n\n* Statement 1 says the umbrella might NOT be in the closet.\n* Statement 2 says IF the umbrella is NOT in the closet, it MUST be in the car.\n\nTherefore...\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
