This means it's possible they are NOT on her head, but doesn't confirm their location.\n* **Statement 2:** Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head. This presents two exclusive possibilities, one of which MUST be true.\n\nNow let's combine the information:\n\n* Statement 1 introduces the possibility that the sunglasses are NOT on her head.\n* Statement 2 requires that IF the sunglasses are NOT on her head, they MUST be in her bag. \n\nTherefore, since we have the possibility of the sunglasses not being on her head (from statement 1), statement 2 forces the conclusion that they must be in her bag.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
