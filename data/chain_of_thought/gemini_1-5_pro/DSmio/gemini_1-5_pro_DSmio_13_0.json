This means it's possible the toy is NOT on the bookshelf.\n* **Statement 2:** Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf. This gives us only two possibilities. \n\nSince Statement 1 tells us the toy might NOT be on the bookshelf, and Statement 2 says the toy MUST be either on the bookshelf OR in the toy box, the only remaining possibility is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
