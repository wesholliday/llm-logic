This means it's possible the piece is NOT on the floor.\n* **Statement 2:** Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor. This presents two options, but remember, Statement 1 suggests one option (blending on the floor) might not be true.\n\nSince the piece might not be on the floor, and the only other option presented is that it's in the box, we can logically conclude...\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
