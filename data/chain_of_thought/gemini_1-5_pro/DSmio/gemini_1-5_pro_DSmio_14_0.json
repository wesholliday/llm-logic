This means it's possible the milk is NOT in the fridge.\n* **Statement 2:** Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge. This gives us two possibilities, and one MUST be true.\n\nNow let's combine the information:\n\n* Statement 1 tells us the milk might NOT be in the fridge.\n* Statement 2 says IF the milk is NOT in the fridge, it MUST be on the counter.\n\nTherefore, since it's possible the milk isn't in the fridge, it must be on the counter.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
