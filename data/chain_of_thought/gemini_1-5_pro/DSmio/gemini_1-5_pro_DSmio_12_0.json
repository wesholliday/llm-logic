This means it's possible the jacket isn't in the closet, but doesn't guarantee it.\n\n* **Statement 2:** Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet. This presents two exclusive possibilities, one of which must be true.\n\nNow let's combine the information:\n\n* Statement 1 casts doubt on the jacket being in the closet, but doesn't rule it out.\n* Statement 2 says IF the jacket isn't in the closet, THEN it MUST be on the chair.\n\nSince Statement 1 leaves open the possibility of the jacket NOT being in the closet, Statement 2 forces us to conclude it must be on the chair.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
