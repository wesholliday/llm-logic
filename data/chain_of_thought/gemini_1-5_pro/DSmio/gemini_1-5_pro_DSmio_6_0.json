This means it's possible the phone is NOT ringing in the kitchen.\n* **Statement 2:** Either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen. This presents two possibilities, and at least one MUST be true.\n\nNow let's consider if Statement 1 allows us to eliminate one of the possibilities in Statement 2:\n\n* Statement 1 says the phone might NOT be ringing in the kitchen. \n* This means the possibility of the phone NOT ringing in the kitchen is still valid. \n* Therefore, we cannot eliminate the first part of Statement 2 (\"the phone is in the living room\").\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
