This means it's possible the book is NOT on the table, but it doesn't confirm its location.\n\n* **Statement 2:** Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table. This presents two exclusive possibilities, the book is EITHER on the shelf OR on the table.\n\nNow let's combine the information:\n\n* Statement 1 allows for the possibility of the book NOT being on the table.\n* Statement 2 requires the book to be either on the shelf OR the table.\n\nSince the book might not be on the table (Statement 1), and it has to be on either the table or the shelf (Statement 2), the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
