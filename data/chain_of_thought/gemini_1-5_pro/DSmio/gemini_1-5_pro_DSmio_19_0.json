This means there's a possibility the watch is NOT on his wrist, but it doesn't confirm its location.\n* **Statement 2:** Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist. This presents two exclusive possibilities, one of which MUST be true.\n\nNow let's combine the information:\n\n* Statement 1 allows for the possibility that the watch is NOT on his wrist.\n* Statement 2 says IF the watch is NOT on his wrist, THEN it MUST be charging on the dresser.\n\nTherefore, since we have the possibility of the watch not being on his wrist (from statement 1), we can conclude based on statement 2 that it must be on the dresser.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
