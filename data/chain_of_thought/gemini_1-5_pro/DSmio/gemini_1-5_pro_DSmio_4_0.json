This means it's possible the cat is NOT playing in the bedroom, but doesn't guarantee it.\n\n* **Statement 2:** Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom. This presents two exclusive possibilities, one of which MUST be true.\n\nNow let's combine the information:\n\n* Statement 1 leaves open the possibility that the cat is NOT playing in the bedroom.\n* If the cat is NOT playing in the bedroom, Statement 2 forces the other possibility to be true: the cat IS napping on the couch.\n\nTherefore, we can logically conclude that the cat must be napping on the couch.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
