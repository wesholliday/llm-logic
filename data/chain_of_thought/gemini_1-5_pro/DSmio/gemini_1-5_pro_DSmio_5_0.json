This means there's a possibility they aren't in the pantry, but it doesn't confirm their location. \n\n* **Statement 2:** Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry. This presents two exclusive possibilities, one of which must be true.\n\nNow let's combine the information:\n\n* Statement 1 casts doubt on the pantry being the location.\n* Statement 2 forces us to choose between the jar and the pantry. \n\nSince the pantry is questionable due to Statement 1, the only remaining option within the constraints of Statement 2 is the jar.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
