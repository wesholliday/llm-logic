This means it's possible the notebook is NOT on the nightstand.\n* **Statement 2:** Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand. This presents two exclusive possibilities, one of which MUST be true.\n\nNow let's combine the information:\n\n* Statement 1 allows for the possibility that the notebook is NOT on the nightstand.\n* Statement 2, in that case, forces the other possibility to be true: the notebook IS in the drawer. \n\nTherefore, we can logically conclude...\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
