This means it's possible the keys are NOT in the cabinet.\n* **Statement 2:** Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet. This presents two options, and at least one MUST be true.\n\nNow let's combine the information:\n\n* Statement 1 makes it possible that the keys are NOT dangling in the cabinet.\n* If the keys are NOT dangling in the cabinet, Statement 2 forces the other option to be true: the keys MUST be in the drawer. \n\nTherefore, we can logically conclude that the keys are in the drawer.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
