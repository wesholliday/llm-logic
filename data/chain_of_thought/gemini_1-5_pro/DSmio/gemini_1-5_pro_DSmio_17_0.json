This means it's possible the scarf is NOT on the coat rack.\n* **Statement 2:** Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack. This presents two options, and at least one MUST be true.\n\nNow let's consider the possibilities:\n\n* **Possibility 1: Scarf IS on the coat rack.** This satisfies Statement 2. However, it contradicts the possibility presented in Statement 1. \n* **Possibility 2: Scarf IS NOT on the coat rack.** This satisfies Statement 1.  Since Statement 2 says it MUST be on the coat rack OR in the backpack, and we've eliminated the coat rack, the only remaining option is the backpack.\n\nTherefore, if the scarf is not on the coat rack, it must be in the backpack.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
