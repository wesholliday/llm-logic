This means it's possible the sock isn't under the bed, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that it is.\n\n* **Statement 2:** Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed. This presents two exclusive possibilities, one of which must be true.\n\n* **Putting them together:**  Statement 1 casts doubt on the sock being under the bed, but doesn't eliminate the possibility. Statement 2 says if it's not under the bed, it MUST be in the laundry basket. \n\nTherefore, since we haven't definitively ruled out the sock being under the bed, we can't definitively say it's in the laundry basket.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
