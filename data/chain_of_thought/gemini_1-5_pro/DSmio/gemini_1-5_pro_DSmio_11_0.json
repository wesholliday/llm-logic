This means it's possible the newspaper is NOT on the porch, but it doesn't tell us where it IS.\n\n* **Statement 2:** Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch. This gives us two possibilities, and says one of them MUST be true.\n\nNow let's combine the information:\n\n* Statement 1 says the newspaper *could* be somewhere other than the porch. \n* Statement 2 says if it's NOT on the porch, the only other option is the driveway.\n\nTherefore, since it's possible the newspaper isn't on the porch, it must be in the driveway.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
