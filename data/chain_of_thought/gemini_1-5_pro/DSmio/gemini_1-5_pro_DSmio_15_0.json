This means it's possible they are NOT lined up by the door.\n* **Statement 2:** Either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door. This presents two exclusive possibilities, one of which MUST be true.\n\nNow let's combine the information:\n\n* Since Statement 1 tells us the shoes might NOT be lined up by the door, and...\n* Statement 2 says they MUST be lined up by the door IF they are not in the closet...\n* The only remaining possibility is that the shoes MUST be in the closet. \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
