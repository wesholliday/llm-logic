            "content": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the room was tidied, then it was not tidied thoroughly. This implies that a room cannot be both \"tidied\" and \"tidied thoroughly\". \n* **Inference to test:** If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied. This is trying to flip the original statement around.\n\nConsider these scenarios:\n\n* **Scenario 1: Room is messy.**  Both the original statement and the inference are true in this case (since the room wasn't tidied at all).\n* **Scenario 2: Room is somewhat tidy.** The original statement is true (it was tidied, but not thoroughly). The inference is also true (since it wasn't thoroughly tidied, it couldn't have been \"tidied\" in the way the inference means it).\n\nThe original statement sets up a situation where \"tidied\" and \"tidied thoroughly\" are mutually exclusive.  Therefore, if something is \"tidied thoroughly\", it cannot be simply \"tidied\".\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
