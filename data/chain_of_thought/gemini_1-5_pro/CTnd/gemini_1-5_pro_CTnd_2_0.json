If she did one, she couldn't have done the other.\n\n* **Statement 2:** If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise.\n    * This is essentially the reverse of the first statement.\n\nSince the first statement tells us the two types of exercise can't both be true, if the second statement is true, it would confirm the first statement. \n\n**Answer: Yes** \n"
