It means that *any* advice offered wasn't helpful.\n\nNow let's look at the statement we're trying to infer:\n\n* **\"If helpful advice was offered...\"** This sets up a different conditional situation, one where helpful advice is the starting point. \n* **\"...then advice was not offered.\"** This is the outcome we're trying to reach. It suggests that helpful advice being offered would contradict the very act of offering advice.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe original statement tells us that any offered advice was not helpful.  However, it doesn't say anything about what would happen if helpful advice *were* to be offered. It's possible that helpful advice could be offered in this scenario, even if it contradicts the original statement's condition. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
