This is in the form of \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"I went to the store\" and Q is \"I did not buy vegetables.\"\n\n* **Contrapositive:** The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".  The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n* **Applying the contrapositive:** In our case, \"not Q\" would be \"I bought vegetables\" and \"not P\" would be \"I did not go to the store.\" So the contrapositive is: \"If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store.\"\n\n* **Inference:** Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
