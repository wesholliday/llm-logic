This implies that there's no situation where clothes can be both washed AND washed properly. \n\n* **Inference to check:** If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed. This is like flipping the original statement around.\n\n* **Reasoning:** If the original statement is true (and it seems to be saying something logically odd), then the flipped version must also be true.  They both exclude the possibility of clothes being both washed and washed properly.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
