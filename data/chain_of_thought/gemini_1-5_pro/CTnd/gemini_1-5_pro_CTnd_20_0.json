This implies that \"recommendation\" and \"strong recommendation\" are mutually exclusive. \n\n* **Statement to infer:** If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made. This is essentially flipping the original statement and seeing if the logic still holds.\n\n* **Reasoning:** Since the original statement tells us \"recommendation\" and \"strong recommendation\" cannot exist together, then if a \"strong recommendation\" exists, a regular \"recommendation\" cannot.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
