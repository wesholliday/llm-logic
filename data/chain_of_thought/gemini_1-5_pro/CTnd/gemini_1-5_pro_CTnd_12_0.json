This sets up a conditional relationship where studying implies not studying long.\n\n* **Inference to test:** If Jane studied long, then she did not study. This flips the conditional relationship, suggesting that studying long implies not studying at all.\n\n* **Contradiction:**  The original statement allows for the possibility that Jane studied, just not for a long time. The inference contradicts this by saying if she studied long, she didn't study at all. \n\n**Answer: No** \n"
