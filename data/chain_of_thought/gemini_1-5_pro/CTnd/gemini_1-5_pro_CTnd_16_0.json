This tells us completion implies a lack of quality.\n\n* **Inference we're testing:** If the job was completed well, then it was not completed. This suggests good quality implies a lack of completion.\n\n* **Contrapositive:**  The original statement's contrapositive is \"If the job WAS completed well, then it WAS NOT completed.\"  A statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.\n\n**Answer:** Yes \n"
