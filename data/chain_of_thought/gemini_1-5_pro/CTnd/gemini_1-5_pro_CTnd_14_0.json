This tells us that \"prepared\" and \"prepared carefully\" are mutually exclusive in this scenario. \n* **Inference to test:** If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared. This is trying to flip the original statement.\n\nNow let's apply the logic:\n\nIf a meal WAS prepared carefully, the original statement tells us it COULDN'T have been prepared (because they are mutually exclusive).  \n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
