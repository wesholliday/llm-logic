It tells us that IF directions exist, THEN they were poorly explained. It doesn't tell us anything about what happens if directions were NOT provided.\n\nNow let's look at the statement we're trying to infer:\n\n* **\"If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided\"** - This is trying to flip and negate the original statement. \n\nHowever, we can't make that inference. Just because directions might be poorly explained when they exist, doesn't mean clear directions automatically mean no directions were given.  It's possible to have no directions, OR to have clearly explained directions.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
