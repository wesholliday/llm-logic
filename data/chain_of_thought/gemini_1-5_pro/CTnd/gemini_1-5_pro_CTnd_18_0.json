This implies that 'discussed' and 'discussed in depth' are mutually exclusive. \n\n* **Inference to test:** If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed. This is trying to flip the original statement.\n\n* **Reasoning:** If something is 'discussed in depth', it is inherently 'discussed'.  Since the original statement says 'discussed' and 'discussed in depth' cannot exist together, the inference must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
