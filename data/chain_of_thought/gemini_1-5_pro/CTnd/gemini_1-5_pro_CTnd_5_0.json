This implies that a cleaned room cannot be considered \"thoroughly cleaned.\"\n\n* **Inference to test:** If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned. This statement contradicts the original statement. The original statement says a cleaned room cannot be thoroughly cleaned, while this inference suggests a thoroughly cleaned room was never cleaned at all.\n\n**Answer:** No \n"
