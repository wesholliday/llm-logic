This implies that 'studying' and 'studying diligently' are mutually exclusive. If one is true, the other must be false.\n\n* **Inference to test:** If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study. This is essentially flipping the original statement and seeing if it holds true.\n\n* **Reasoning:** Since the original statement tells us 'studying' and 'studying diligently' cannot coexist, if Ben DID study diligently, then he couldn't have just 'studied' in a general sense. \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
