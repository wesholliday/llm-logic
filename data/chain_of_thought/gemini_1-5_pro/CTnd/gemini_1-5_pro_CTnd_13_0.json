If he does any exercise, it's not considered \"much\".\n\n* **Statement 2:** If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise.\n    * This statement suggests that exercising \"much\" and exercising at all are mutually exclusive. \n\nNow let's consider if we can infer Statement 2 from Statement 1.  Statement 1 doesn't say that Alex *can't* exercise much, only that if he exercises, it's not considered \"much\".  It's possible he could have exercised a lot (which we'd then know isn't considered \"much\" based on Statement 1).\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
