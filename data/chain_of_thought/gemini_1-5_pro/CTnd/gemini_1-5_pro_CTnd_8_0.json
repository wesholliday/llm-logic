This is because the original statement says if it WAS addressed, it wasn't addressed effectively.\n\n* **Question:** Can we infer \"If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed\"?\n* **This is asking:** Does making the second part of the original statement true (it WAS addressed effectively) force the first part to be false (it was NOT addressed)?\n\n**Answer:** Yes \n"
