This implies that \"meal\" and \"large meal\" are mutually exclusive in this context. \n\n* **Inference to test:** If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal.\n\n* **Reasoning:**  The original statement says if I ate *any* meal, it wasn't large.  The inference flips this, suggesting if I ate a large meal, it wasn't *any* kind of meal. This directly contradicts the initial statement's implication.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
