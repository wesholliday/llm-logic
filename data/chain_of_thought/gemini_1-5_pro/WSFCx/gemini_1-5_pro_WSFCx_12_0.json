These possibilities are not presented as mutually exclusive, meaning one could happen, the other could happen, or both could happen. The second sentence changes the conjunction from \"or\" to \"and,\" implying that both possibilities must occur. This is not a valid inference from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
