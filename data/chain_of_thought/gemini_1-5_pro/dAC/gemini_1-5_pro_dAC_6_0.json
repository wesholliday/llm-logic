It only tells us what happens if Sue chooses pizza. It doesn't tell us anything about what happens if Sue chooses something else.\n* **Statement 2:** Bob chose pasta. This tells us Bob's choice, but doesn't directly reveal Sue's choice.\n\nWe know Bob chose pasta. However, Statement 1 doesn't guarantee that Bob only chooses pasta if Sue chooses pizza. It's possible Bob chooses pasta even if Sue chooses something else. \n\n**Answer:** no \n"
