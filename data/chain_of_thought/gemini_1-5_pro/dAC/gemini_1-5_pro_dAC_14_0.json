It doesn't mean the bear IS in the cave, just that IF it was, THEN the wolf would be in the den.\n* **Statement 2:** The wolf was in the den. This tells us a fact, but it doesn't automatically tell us anything about the bear.\n\nHere's why we can't deduce the bear was in the cave:\n\nImagine the wolf likes its den and is there often.  The bear might be out for a walk, but the wolf would still be in its den. Statement 1 only tells us what happens IF the bear is in the cave, not what happens if the wolf is in the den.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
