It doesn't mean the griffin *was* in the forest, just that *if* it was, then the unicorn was too.\n* **Statement 2:** The unicorn was in the forest. This tells us the second part of our conditional statement is true. \n\nHowever, knowing the second part of a conditional statement is true doesn't tell us if the first part is true or not. \n\n**Example:** If it's raining (statement 1), then the ground is wet (statement 2).  Just because the ground is wet doesn't mean it's raining - something else could have made it wet.\n\nTherefore, we cannot deduce that the griffin was in the forest.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
