It doesn't mean the dog *was* inside, just that *if* the dog was inside, *then* the cat was outside.\n* **Statement 2:** The cat was outside. This tells us a fact, but it doesn't automatically tell us anything about the dog's location.\n\nWe cannot definitively say the dog was inside just because the cat was outside. The cat being outside doesn't automatically mean the dog was the reason. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
