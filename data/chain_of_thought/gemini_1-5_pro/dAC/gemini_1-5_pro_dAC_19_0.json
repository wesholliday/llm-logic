            "content": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n* **Statement 1:** If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This is a conditional statement. It tells us what happens if Tom watches football, but it doesn't guarantee that he actually did.\n* **Statement 2:** Jen watched basketball. This tells us a fact about Jen, but it doesn't directly tell us anything about Tom.\n\nEven though Jen watched basketball, we can't automatically assume Tom watched football.  Statement 1 only works in one direction. It's possible Jen watches basketball even when Tom doesn't watch football.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
