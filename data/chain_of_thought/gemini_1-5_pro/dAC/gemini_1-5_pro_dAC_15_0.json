It doesn't tell us anything about what actually happened, only what would happen IF Sam took a plane.\n* **Statement 2:** Erin took a train. This tells us a fact, but it doesn't reveal anything about Sam's mode of transportation.\n\nEven though Erin taking a train aligns with the conditional statement, it doesn't mean the \"if\" part of the statement is true.  Sam could have taken a car, a bus, or even a hot air balloon for all we know.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
