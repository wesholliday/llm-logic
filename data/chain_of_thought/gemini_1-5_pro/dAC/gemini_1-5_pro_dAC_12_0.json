It doesn't mean Joe *did* go to the park, just that *if* he did, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n* **Statement 2:** Lucy went to the zoo. This tells us Lucy went to the zoo, but it doesn't tell us anything about why or if Joe went to the park.\n\nConsider this: Maybe Lucy goes to the zoo every day, regardless of Joe's park visits. Just because Lucy went to the zoo doesn't mean Joe went to the park. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
