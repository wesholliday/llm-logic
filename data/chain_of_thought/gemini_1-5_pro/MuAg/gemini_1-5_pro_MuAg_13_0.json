The second statement says the movie MUST have had English audio and simply HAD subtitles.  Since the second statement is less strict about the subtitles (simply requiring their presence rather than requiring them as a necessity), it's a weaker claim. We can infer weaker claims from stronger ones.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
