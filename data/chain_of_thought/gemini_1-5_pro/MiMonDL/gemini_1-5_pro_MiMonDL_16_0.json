It acknowledges the possibility of a delay but doesn't rule out the possibility of it being on time. The statement \"The flight might be delayed or on time\" encompasses both possibilities explicitly mentioned in the original statement. Since the original statement already includes the possibility of being on time, the second statement doesn't introduce any new information and is therefore a valid inference. \nAnswer: yes \n"
