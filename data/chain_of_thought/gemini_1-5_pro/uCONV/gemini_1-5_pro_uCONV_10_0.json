This means the dog being inside is a condition that leads to the cat being outside. \n\n* **Question:** If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside. This is asking if the reverse of the original statement is also true.\n\n* **Consider this:** Just because the cat is outside doesn't automatically mean the dog caused it. The cat could be outside for many other reasons unrelated to the dog. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
