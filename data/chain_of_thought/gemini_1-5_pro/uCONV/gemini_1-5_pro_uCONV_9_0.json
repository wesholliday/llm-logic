We can represent this as: If A, then B.\n\n* **Question:**  If Mark bought the blue shirt (B), then Lisa bought the red shirt (A). This is: If B, then A.\n\n* **Reasoning:**  Just because 'If A, then B' is true, it doesn't automatically mean 'If B, then A' is also true.  \n\n* **Example:** If it's raining (A), then the ground is wet (B). This is true. But if the ground is wet (B), does it mean it's raining (A)? Not necessarily. It could be wet for other reasons.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
