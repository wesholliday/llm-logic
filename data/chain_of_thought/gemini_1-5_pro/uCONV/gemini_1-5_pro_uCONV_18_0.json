This is a conditional statement where \"the doll was plastic\" is the hypothesis and \"the truck was metal\" is the conclusion.\n\n* **Question:** If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic. This is asking if the reverse of the original statement is also true.\n\n* **Reasoning:** Just because the original statement is true, it doesn't mean the reverse is automatically true.  There could be other reasons the truck was metal. For example, maybe all the trucks were metal, regardless of the doll's material.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
