            "content": "Let's break this down:\n\n* **The original statement:** If Tom watched football (let's call this \"T\"), then Jen watched basketball (let's call this \"J\").  We can represent this as: If T, then J.\n\n* **What we're asked to infer:** If Jen watched basketball (J), then Tom watched football (T). This is: If J, then T.\n\n* **The key:**  Just because something is true in one direction doesn't mean it's true in reverse. For example, if it's raining (R), then the ground is wet (W). But if the ground is wet (W), does that automatically mean it's raining (R)? No, it could be wet for other reasons.\n\n* **Applying this to our problem:**  Even if we know Jen watched basketball, we can't automatically say Tom watched football. Maybe Jen just likes basketball, regardless of Tom's viewing choices.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
