Just because something is true in one direction doesn't mean it's true in the other.\n\n* **Example:** If it's raining (griffin in the forest), then the ground is wet (unicorn in the forest). \n* This doesn't mean that if the ground is wet (unicorn in the forest), it's automatically raining (griffin in the forest).  There could be other reasons for a wet ground.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was in the forest.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
