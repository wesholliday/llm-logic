We can represent this as P -> S \n* **Question:** If Kate ate salad (S), then Ben ate pasta (P)? This is S -> P\n\nWe need to determine if the original statement guarantees the truth of the question.  Consider these possibilities:\n\n* **Ben ate pasta, Kate ate salad:** This fits both statements (P -> S is true, and S -> P would also be true).\n* **Ben ate pasta, Kate ate something else:** This makes the original statement false (P -> S is not true).\n* **Ben didn't eat pasta, Kate ate salad:** The original statement doesn't address this scenario. It only tells us what happens if Ben *does* eat pasta.  S -> P could be true or false, and the original statement wouldn't be violated.\n\nBecause the original statement doesn't guarantee that Ben ate pasta *whenever* Kate eats salad, we can't infer the question is true.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
