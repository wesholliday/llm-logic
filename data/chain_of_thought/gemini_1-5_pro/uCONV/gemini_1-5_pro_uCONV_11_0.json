It doesn't tell us anything about what happens if the cake *wasn't* chocolate. \n\n* **Question:** If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate? This is asking us to reverse the original statement.\n\n* **Reasoning:** Just because the muffins were blueberry doesn't automatically mean the cake was chocolate. Maybe the muffins are always blueberry, regardless of the cake flavor. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
