It doesn't mean the truck is *always* blue, just that it's blue *if* the car is red.\n\n* **Question:** If the truck was blue, then the car was red. This is asking us to reverse the statement and see if it's still true.\n\n* **Reasoning:**  Just because the truck is blue doesn't automatically mean the car is red. There could be other reasons the truck is blue.  \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
