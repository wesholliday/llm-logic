It doesn't mean the apple *must* be red, just that *if* it is, then the banana is yellow.\n\n* **What we're asked to infer:** If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red. This is the reverse of the original statement.\n\n* **Why this doesn't work:**  Just because the banana is yellow doesn't mean the apple caused it to be yellow. There could be other reasons the banana is yellow (it's ripe, it's a variety that's naturally yellow, etc.). \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
