We can represent this as P \u2192 T.\n* **The question:**  If Erin took a train (T), then Sam took a plane (P). This is T \u2192 P.\n\nThis is asking if the original statement being true automatically means the reverse is also true. This is called the converse of the original statement.\n\n**Important:** The converse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Just because P \u2192 T is true, it doesn't mean T \u2192 P is also true.\n\n**Example:**  If it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (T). This is true. But if the ground is wet (T), does that mean it's raining (P)? Not necessarily, there could be other reasons.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
