Just because the wolf being in the den is a result of the bear being in the cave, doesn't mean the wolf being in the den *always* means the bear is in the cave. There could be other reasons the wolf is in the den.\n\n**Example:** Maybe the wolf goes to the den when it's raining, regardless of the bear's location.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
