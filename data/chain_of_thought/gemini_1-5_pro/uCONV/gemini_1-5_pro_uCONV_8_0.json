It doesn't tell us anything about what happens when the mummy is awake. \n\nNow, the question is asking if the reverse is true:\n\n* **If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake.**  \n\nThe mummy being awake could be due to reasons other than the vampire being awake. The original statement doesn't guarantee the vampire is awake just because the mummy is.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
