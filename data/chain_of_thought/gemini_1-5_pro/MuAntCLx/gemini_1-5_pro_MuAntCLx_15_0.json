The original statement tells us something about \"the zizz.\"  The second statement tells us the same thing about \"the zizz\" but adds on  \"...and flimble a zibble\".  Since the second statement adds information not present in the first, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
