The original statement tells us something must be true about \"the gribble.\"  The new statement tells us that same thing must be true, but *also* that something else must be true about \"flump snorkel,\" which is not mentioned in the original statement. We have no basis to infer anything about \"flump snorkel\" from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
