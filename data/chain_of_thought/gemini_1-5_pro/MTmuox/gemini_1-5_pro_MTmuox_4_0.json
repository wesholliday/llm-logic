This means the fribble might not have crinked. \n* **Statement 2:** If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked. This tells us snurgling leads to crinkling.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The fribble was not snurgled\"?\n\n* If the fribble WAS snurgled, then according to statement 2, it MUST have crinkled.\n* But statement 1 says the fribble might NOT have crinkled.\n* To avoid a contradiction, the fribble cannot have been snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
