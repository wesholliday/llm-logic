We don't know for sure.\n\n* **Statement 2:** If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled.\n    * This tells us that blimmed flugels are always zargled.\n\n* **Our Goal:** Can we infer \"The flugel was not blimmed\"?\n\n* **Reasoning:**  If the flugel *was* blimmed, then according to Statement 2, it must have been zargled. But Statement 1 says it's not necessarily the case that the flugel was zargled.  Therefore, to avoid a contradiction, the flugel couldn't have been blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
