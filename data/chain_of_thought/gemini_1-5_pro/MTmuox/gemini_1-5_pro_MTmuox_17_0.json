This means the flob might not have movated.\n* **Premise 2:** If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated. This sets up a conditional relationship.\n* **Conclusion:** The flob was not skizzled.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nWe need to see if the premises force the conclusion to be true.  If the flob *were* skizzled, then according to Premise 2, it must have movated.  But Premise 1 tells us it's possible the flob did *not* movate.  Therefore, to avoid a contradiction, the flob couldn't have been skizzled.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
