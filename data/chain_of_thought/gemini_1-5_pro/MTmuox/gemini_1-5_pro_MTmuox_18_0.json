This means the shank might not have been nugged.\n* **Premise 2:** If the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged. \n* **Conclusion we're testing:** The shank was not plooked.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nIf the shank *were* plooked (going against our desired conclusion), then according to Premise 2, it *must* have been nugged.  However, Premise 1 tells us the shank might *not* have been nugged. This creates a contradiction if we assume the shank was plooked.\n\nTo avoid the contradiction, we must conclude that the shank was not plooked.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
