This means the fleeg might have been surned, or it might not have been. \n* **Premise 2:** If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned. This tells us bluttered fleegs are always surned fleegs.\n\nNow let's consider the conclusion:\n\n* **Conclusion:** The fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nCould the conclusion be false even if the premises are true?  Yes.  Here's why:\n\nImagine the fleeg was surned, but not bluttered. This would fit both premises:\n\n* Premise 1 is true because the fleeg didn't *have* to be surned, even though it was.\n* Premise 2 is true because it only talks about what happens if the fleeg *was* bluttered, which it wasn't in this scenario.\n\nSince the conclusion could be false even with the premises true, we cannot infer it.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
