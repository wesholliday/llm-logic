This means the splat might not have quanked.\n* **Premise 2:** If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked. \n* **Conclusion:** The splat was not morphed.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nWe need to see if the premises force the conclusion to be true.  Let's consider the opposite of the conclusion: What if the splat *was* morphed?  If that's true, then according to Premise 2, the splat must have quanked.  But Premise 1 says the splat might *not* have quanked. This creates a contradiction.\n\nSince assuming the splat was morphed leads to a contradiction, the splat couldn't have been morphed.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
