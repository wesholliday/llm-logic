This means the clug might or might not have been snugged. \n* **Premise 2:** If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged. This tells us snugging is necessary if fleeking occurred.\n\nNow let's consider the desired conclusion:\n\n* **Conclusion:** The clug was not fleeked.\n\nCan we get there? Premise 1 leaves open the possibility the clug WAS snugged. If the clug WAS snugged, Premise 2 doesn't forbid it from also being fleeked.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
