This means it's possible the grommet plopped the frink, but it's not necessarily true. \n\n* **Premise 2:** If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink. This sets up a conditional relationship.\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude:\n\n* **Conclusion:** The grommet was not sploffed.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n* **Possibility 1:** The grommet was sploffed. If this is true, then according to Premise 2, the grommet MUST have plopped the frink.  This doesn't contradict Premise 1 (which only says it's not NECESSARILY true).\n\n* **Possibility 2:** The grommet was not sploffed. This doesn't contradict either premise. Premise 2 only applies if the grommet WAS sploffed.\n\nSince we have at least one possibility where the conclusion could be false, we cannot definitively infer the conclusion.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
