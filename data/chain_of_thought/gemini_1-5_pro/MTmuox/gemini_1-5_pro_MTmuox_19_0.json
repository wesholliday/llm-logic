Premise 1 tells us the \"plagged\" part of that statement is NOT true.  To determine if we can infer the smonk wasn't vreebled, let's consider what happens if it WAS vreebled:\n\n* If the smonk WAS vreebled, then according to Premise 2, it MUST have plagged.\n* But Premise 1 tells us it's NOT the case that the smonk plagged. \n\nThis creates a contradiction.  Therefore, our assumption that the smonk was vreebled must be false.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
