This means it's possible the wug bimmed the zoint, but it's not necessarily true. \n* **Premise 2:** If the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint. This sets up a conditional relationship.\n* **Conclusion:** The wug was not flooped.\n\nNow let's consider if the premises lead to the conclusion:\n\n* If the wug WAS flooped, then Premise 2 would force the wug to have bimmed the zoint.\n* However, Premise 1 says it's NOT necessarily true that the wug bimmed the zoint.\n* Therefore, to avoid a contradiction, the wug couldn't have been flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
