IF the sneg was crampled, THEN it definitely sproted the frink.\n\n* **Our Goal:**  Determine if we can definitively say \"The sneg was not crampled\".\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nIf the sneg WAS crampled (let's assume that for a moment), then Statement 2 tells us it MUST have sproted the frink.  However, Statement 1 says it's NOT a certainty that the sneg sproted the frink.  This creates a contradiction if we assume the sneg was crampled.\n\nTo avoid the contradiction, the only option left is that the sneg was NOT crampled.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
