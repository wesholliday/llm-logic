This means the smip might NOT have lupped the zoint.\n\n* **Statement 2:** If the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint.\n\n* **Goal:**  Determine if we can definitively say \"The smip was not shripped.\"\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nIf the smip WAS shripped (let's assume this for a moment), then according to Statement 2, it MUST have lupped the zoint.  However, Statement 1 tells us it's possible the smip did NOT lup the zoint.  This creates a contradiction if we assume the smip was shripped.\n\nTo avoid the contradiction, the only possibility left is that the smip was NOT shripped.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
