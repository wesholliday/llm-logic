(In other words, it's possible the zinger wasn't smuggled).\n\n* **Premise 2:** If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger must have been smuggled.\n\nWe want to see if we can conclude:\n\n* **Conclusion:** The zinger was not fraggled.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nImagine the zinger WAS fraggled.  According to Premise 2, this would automatically mean it was smuggled.  But Premise 1 tells us it's NOT necessarily true that the zinger was smuggled.  This creates a contradiction if we assume the zinger was fraggled. \n\nTo avoid the contradiction, the only option is that the zinger was NOT fraggled.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
