This means the sprocket might have been daggled, or it might not have been. \n* **Premise 2:** If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled. This tells us cranking leads to daggling.\n\nNow let's consider the conclusion:\n\n* **Conclusion:** The sprocket was not cranked.\n\nCould this be false even if the premises are true?  Yes!  Here's why:\n\nImagine the sprocket was daggled, but not because it was cranked. Maybe something else caused it to be daggled. In this scenario, Premise 1 is still true (it wasn't *necessarily* daggled), and Premise 2 is still true (cranking *would* lead to daggling). But the conclusion is false because the sprocket could have been daggled for some other reason.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
