This sets up a conditional relationship: Oven on --> Warm kitchen.\n* **Conclusion:** If the oven is on AND the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm. This adds an extra condition to the original premise.\n\nNow, does the truth of the premise guarantee the truth of the conclusion? \n\nLet's consider a scenario where the oven is on (making the premise true).  Could the kitchen still be cold (making the conclusion false)?  Yes, if the pilot light being out somehow prevents the oven from heating.\n\nSince we found a scenario where the premise is true but the conclusion could be false, the argument is not logically valid.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
