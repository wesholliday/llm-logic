It's saying *any* medication will make me feel better.\n2. **The conclusion introduces a specific type of medication: expired medication.**  This is where the logic breaks down. Just because medication *in general* might make me feel better, it doesn't follow that *expired* medication will have the same effect. Expired medication could be ineffective or even harmful.\n\n**Therefore, the argument makes an unjustified jump from a general statement to a specific conclusion.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
