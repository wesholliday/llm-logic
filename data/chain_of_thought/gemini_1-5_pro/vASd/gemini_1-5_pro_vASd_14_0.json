This is a conditional statement.\n* **Conclusion:** If I study hard (P) and the test is in Chinese (R), then I will pass the test (Q). This is also a conditional statement.\n\nWe need to determine if the conclusion *must* be true if the premise is true.  \n\nConsider this: Even if studying hard guarantees passing the test in general, the conclusion introduces a new factor: the test being in Chinese.  This new factor could make the conclusion false even if the premise is true. For example, if I don't understand Chinese, studying hard might not be enough to pass a test in Chinese.\n\nSince the truth of the premise doesn't guarantee the truth of the conclusion, the argument is not logically valid.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
