We only care about the logical connection between the premise and conclusion.\n\n2. **Identify the added condition:** The conclusion adds the condition \"and it was misrouted\" to the premise.\n\n3. **Consider the impact of the added condition:**  The premise only guarantees arrival today *if* the package shipped.  Misrouting could easily delay arrival, even if the package shipped.\n\n4. **Evaluate the connection:** The conclusion makes an assumption that isn't supported by the premise. The premise doesn't tell us what happens if a package is misrouted.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
