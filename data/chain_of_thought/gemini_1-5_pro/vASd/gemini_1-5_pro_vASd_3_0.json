The original premise only guarantees the car's safety IF it's in the garage. It says nothing about what happens if there's an additional event like a flood. \n\nA valid argument means the conclusion MUST be true IF the premise is true. Since the flooding situation isn't addressed in the premise, the conclusion isn't guaranteed.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
