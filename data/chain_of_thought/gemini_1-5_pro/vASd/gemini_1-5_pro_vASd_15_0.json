This seems like a generally true statement. \n* **Conclusion:** If I charge my phone AND it has a dead battery, it will have power. This gets trickier. A dead battery might mean it's incapable of holding a charge.\n\nThe conclusion adds an extra condition (dead battery) that could make the premise untrue.  Just because you charge something doesn't mean it *can* hold power.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
