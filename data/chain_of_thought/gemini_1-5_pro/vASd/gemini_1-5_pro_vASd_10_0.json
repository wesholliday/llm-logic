The original premise only guarantees shipping if the order is placed. It says nothing about what happens if the item is out of stock. \n\nIt's entirely possible that an out-of-stock item won't ship, even if an order is placed.  \n\nTherefore, the conclusion doesn't logically follow from the premise.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
