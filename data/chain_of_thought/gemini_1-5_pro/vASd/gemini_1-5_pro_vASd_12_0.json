This is a conditional statement:  P implies Q.\n* **Conclusion:** If I finish my homework (P) and my computer catches on fire (R), I can play video games (Q). This is also a conditional statement: P and R implies Q.\n\nThe conclusion introduces a new condition (R) that wasn't part of the original premise. The premise only guarantees I can play video games if I finish my homework. It says nothing about what happens if my computer catches fire. \n\nEven if I finish my homework (P), the new condition (R) could prevent me from playing video games (Q). \n\nTherefore, the conclusion doesn't logically follow from the premise.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
