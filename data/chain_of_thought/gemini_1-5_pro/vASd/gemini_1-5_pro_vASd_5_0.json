Even if the bill is initially paid, a bounced check means it ultimately wasn't paid successfully.\n\n3. **Apply logic:** If a paid bill is required for services to continue (as the premise states), then a bounced check would likely disrupt the services, contradicting the conclusion.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
