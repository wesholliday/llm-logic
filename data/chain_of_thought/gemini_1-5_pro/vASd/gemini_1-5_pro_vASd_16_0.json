The original premise only guarantees a lush, green lawn if it's fertilized. It says nothing about what happens if there's also a drought.  Droughts could easily prevent the lawn from being lush and green, even with fertilizer.\n\nSince the conclusion introduces a new factor that could contradict the premise, the argument is not logically sound.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
