This is a common-sense statement that generally holds true.\n* **Conclusion:** If the match is struck and it has been soaked in water, then it will light. This conclusion adds a condition to the premise: the match being soaked in water.\n\nNow, let's consider the impact of this added condition.  We know that a wet match is unlikely to light, even if struck.  Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise. \n\n**Answer:** no \n"
