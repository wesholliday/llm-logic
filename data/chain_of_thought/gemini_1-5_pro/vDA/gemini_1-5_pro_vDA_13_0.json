This sets up a conditional relationship. \n* **Premise 2:** The car was not red. This tells us the condition in premise 1 is not met.\n* **Conclusion:** The truck was not blue. The argument is trying to conclude this based on the car not being red.\n\nHere's why this is not logically valid:\n\nImagine the truck is usually blue, regardless of the car's color.  Just because the car wasn't red doesn't automatically mean the truck *couldn't* be blue. The original statement only dictates the truck's color *if* the car is red. It says nothing about what happens if the car is *not* red.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
