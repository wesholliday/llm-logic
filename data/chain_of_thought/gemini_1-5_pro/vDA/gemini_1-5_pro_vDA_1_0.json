This sets up a conditional relationship: Mary being at the wedding would guarantee Sue being there.\n* **Premise 2:** Mary was not at the wedding. This tells us the initial condition in Premise 1 is not met.\n* **Conclusion:** Sue was not at the wedding. The argument is trying to conclude this based on Mary's absence.\n\nHowever, Premise 1 only tells us what happens *if* Mary was there. It doesn't say anything about what happens if Mary *wasn't* there.  Sue could have been at the wedding even if Mary wasn't. \n\nTherefore, the argument is making an invalid inference.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
