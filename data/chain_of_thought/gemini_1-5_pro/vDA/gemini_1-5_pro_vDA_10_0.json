Here's why it's not valid:\n\n* **Premise 1 only tells us what happens if the dog IS inside.** It doesn't tell us anything about what happens if the dog is NOT inside. \n* **The cat could be outside for other reasons, even if the dog is not inside.**  \n\n**Example:** Maybe the cat enjoys being outside and goes out regardless of the dog's location.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
