This sets up a conditional relationship.\n* **Premise 2:** Alex did not finish the race. This tells us the initial condition of the first premise is not met.\n* **Conclusion:** Chris did not finish the race. The argument is trying to conclude this based on the premises.\n\nNow, let's consider if the conclusion *must* be true based on the premises.  Just because Alex didn't finish the race doesn't automatically mean Chris didn't. It's possible Chris finished the race even though Alex didn't. \n\n**Answer:** no \n"
