This sets up a conditional relationship.\n* **Premise 2:** Jeff did not play basketball. This tells us the condition in Premise 1 is not met.\n* **Conclusion:** Amy did not play tennis. The argument is trying to conclude this based on the fact that Jeff didn't play basketball.\n\nHere's why this is not logically valid:\n\nPremise 1 only tells us what happens if Jeff *did* play basketball. It doesn't say anything about what happens if he *didn't* play.  Amy could still have played tennis even if Jeff didn't play basketball. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
