(Not P)\n* **Conclusion:** Erin did not take a train. (Not Q)\n\nThis argument structure is known as \"denying the antecedent\".  It's a fallacy because even if the first premise is true, it doesn't guarantee the conclusion. \n\n**Here's why:**\n\nJust because Sam didn't take a plane doesn't mean Erin couldn't have taken a train for other reasons.  They are not necessarily dependent events.\n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine the first premise is true.  It's possible Sam took a car, and Erin still took a train. This wouldn't violate the first premise.\n\n**Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
