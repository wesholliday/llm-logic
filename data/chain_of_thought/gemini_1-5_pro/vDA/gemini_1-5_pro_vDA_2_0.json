This sets up a conditional relationship. \n* **Premise 2:** The griffin was not in the forest. This tells us the first part of the conditional statement in Premise 1 is false.\n* **Conclusion:** The unicorn was not in the forest. The argument is trying to conclude this based on the griffin's absence.\n\nNow, consider this: just because the griffin wasn't in the forest doesn't automatically mean the unicorn wasn't either.  The unicorn could have been there without the griffin. \n\nThis type of reasoning is flawed.  \n\nAnswer: no \n"
