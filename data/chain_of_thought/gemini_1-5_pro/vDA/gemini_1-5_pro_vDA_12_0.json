The inverse of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not P, then not Q\".  However, the inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nLet's consider a scenario where Joe didn't go to the park, but Lucy decided to go to the zoo anyway. This scenario would still satisfy the premises (Joe didn't go to the park) but would contradict the conclusion (Lucy did go to the zoo).\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
