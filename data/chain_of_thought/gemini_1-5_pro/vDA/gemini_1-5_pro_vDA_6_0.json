(Not P)\n* **Conclusion:** Bob did not choose pasta. (Not Q)\n\nThis argument structure is attempting to use the concept of *modus tollens*, which is a valid argument form. Modus tollens states: If P, then Q. Not P. Therefore, not Q.\n\nHowever, the argument given is **not** a correct application of modus tollens.  The original statement tells us what happens IF Sue chooses pizza.  We are then told Sue did NOT choose pizza. This doesn't tell us anything definitive about Bob's choice. It's entirely possible Bob still chose pasta, even if Sue didn't choose pizza.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
