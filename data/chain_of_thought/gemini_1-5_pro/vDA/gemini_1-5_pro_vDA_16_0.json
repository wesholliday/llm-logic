This sets up a conditional relationship.\n* **Premise 2:** The shirt was not cotton. This tells us the initial condition of the first premise is not met.\n* **Conclusion:** The pants were not denim. The argument is trying to conclude this based on the first two premises.\n\nHere's why this is not logically valid:\n\nImagine the shirt is made of silk. Premise 2 still holds true (the shirt wasn't cotton).  However, this tells us *nothing* about the pants. They could still be denim, even if the shirt isn't cotton. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
