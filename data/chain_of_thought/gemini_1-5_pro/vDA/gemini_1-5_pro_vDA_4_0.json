(Not A)\n* **Conclusion:** The robot did not visit Jupiter. (Not B)\n\nThis argument structure is attempting to use the inverse to prove the conclusion.  The inverse of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not A, then not B\".  However, the inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\n**Example:**\n\n* **Original:** If it's raining (A), then the ground is wet (B). \n* **Inverse:** If it's not raining (Not A), then the ground is not wet (Not B).\n\nThe original statement is usually true, but the inverse is not always true. The ground could be wet for other reasons.\n\n**Therefore, this argument form is not logically valid because it relies on the fallacy of the inverse.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
