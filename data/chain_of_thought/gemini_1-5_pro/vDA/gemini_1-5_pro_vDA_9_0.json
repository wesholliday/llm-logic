            "content": "Here's how to break down the argument:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If Lisa bought the red shirt (Let's call this 'A'), then Mark bought the blue shirt (Let's call this 'B').  This is a conditional statement:  If A, then B.\n* **Premise 2:** Lisa did not buy the red shirt (Not A).\n* **Conclusion:** Mark did not buy the blue shirt (Not B).\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe argument structure is trying to use the fallacy of denying the antecedent.  Just because Lisa didn't buy the red shirt (A is false) doesn't automatically mean Mark didn't buy the blue shirt (B is false).  There could be other reasons why Mark might buy the blue shirt.\n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine Mark loves blue shirts and buys one every week, regardless of Lisa's shopping choices.  In this case, even if Lisa doesn't buy the red shirt, Mark still buys a blue shirt.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
