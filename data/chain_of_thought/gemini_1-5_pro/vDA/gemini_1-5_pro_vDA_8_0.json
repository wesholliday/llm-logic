We can think of this like a rule: Vampire awake = Mummy awake.\n* **Premise 2:** The vampire was not awake. \n* **Conclusion:** The mummy was not awake.\n\nOur goal is to see if the conclusion *must* be true IF the premises are true.\n\nConsider this: Just because the vampire being awake means the mummy is awake, does that mean the mummy can't be awake on its own?  \n\nIt's possible the mummy was awake for other reasons, even if the vampire was sleeping. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
