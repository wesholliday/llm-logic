This means there's at least a possibility the book wasn't written by James. \n* **Conclusion:** The book *might not* have been written by James. This is saying there's a possibility the book wasn't written by James.\n\nSince the premise and conclusion are essentially stating the same idea (that there's a possibility James didn't write the book), the argument follows a logically sound structure.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
