This means there's a possibility the dog wasn't inside.\n* **Conclusion:** The dog *might not* have been inside. This means there's a possibility the dog wasn't inside.\n\nSince the premise and conclusion both express the same idea (that there's a possibility the dog wasn't inside), the argument is logically sound. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
