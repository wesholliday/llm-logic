There's room for it to be elsewhere.\n* **Conclusion:** \"The notebook MIGHT NOT be in the drawer.\" This means there's a possibility the notebook isn't in the drawer.\n\nSince the premise allows for the possibility of the notebook being outside the drawer, the conclusion logically follows. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
