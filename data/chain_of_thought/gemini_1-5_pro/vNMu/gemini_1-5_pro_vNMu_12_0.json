This means there are other possibilities for the jacket's location.\n* **Conclusion:** The jacket MIGHT NOT be draped over the chair. This aligns with the premise, as it acknowledges the possibility of the jacket being elsewhere.\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premise, the argument is valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
