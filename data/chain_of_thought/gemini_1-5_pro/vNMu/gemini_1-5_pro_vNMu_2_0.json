This means it was possible the griffin was NOT in the forest.\n* **Conclusion:** The griffin MIGHT NOT have been in the forest. This means it's possible the griffin was NOT in the forest.\n\nThe premise and conclusion are essentially saying the same thing: that it's possible the griffin wasn't in the forest. \n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premise, \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
