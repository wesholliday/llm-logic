This means the milk could be somewhere else, or it might not even exist. \n* **Conclusion:** The milk MIGHT NOT be on the counter. This is saying there's a possibility the milk isn't there.\n\nThe premise allows for the possibility of the milk not being on the counter. Since the conclusion merely states that the milk might not be on the counter, it aligns with the possibility presented in the premise. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
