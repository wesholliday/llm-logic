This means there's a possibility Jeff didn't play basketball. \n* **Conclusion:** Jeff *might not* have played basketball. This means there's a possibility Jeff didn't play basketball.\n\nThe premise and conclusion are essentially saying the same thing: there's a possibility Jeff didn't play basketball.  \n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premise, the argument is valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
