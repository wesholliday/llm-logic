This means it wasn't obligatory for Mary to be there. \n* **Conclusion:** Mary *might not* have been at the wedding. This means it's possible Mary wasn't there.\n\nNow let's consider if the premise guarantees the conclusion:\n\n* If something isn't obligatory, does that mean it's possible it didn't happen? Yes. \n\nTherefore:\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
