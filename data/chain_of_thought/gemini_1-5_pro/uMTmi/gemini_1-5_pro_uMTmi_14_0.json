This doesn't automatically mean the bear wasn't in the cave.  It's possible the wolf wasn't in the den for some other reason unrelated to the bear. \n\nStatement 1 only creates a connection IF the bear is in the cave. It doesn't tell us anything definitive if the wolf is NOT in the den.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
