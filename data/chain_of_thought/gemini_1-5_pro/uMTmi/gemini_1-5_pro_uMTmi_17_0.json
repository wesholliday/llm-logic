However, Statement 2 says Kate might NOT have eaten salad. This creates a contradiction. Therefore, Possibility 1 cannot be true.\n\n* **Possibility 2: Ben did not eat pasta.** This possibility aligns with both statements. If Ben didn't eat pasta, then Statement 1 doesn't apply, and Kate is free to eat or not eat salad as Statement 2 suggests.\n\nSince Possibility 1 leads to a contradiction and Possibility 2 is consistent, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
