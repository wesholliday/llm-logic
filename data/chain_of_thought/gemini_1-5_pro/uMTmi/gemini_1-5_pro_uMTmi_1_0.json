She could have been there or not.\n* **Possibility 2: Sue was NOT at the wedding.**  According to Statement 1, if Mary WAS at the wedding, Sue MUST have been too. Since Sue wasn't there, this directly contradicts the possibility of Mary being present.\n\nTherefore, because Sue might not have been at the wedding, we know Mary couldn't have been either.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
