This means there are two possibilities:\n\n1. **The book IS a mystery novel:** If this is true, it's still possible James wrote it (Premise 1).\n2. **The book IS NOT a mystery novel:** If this is true, then we know for sure James did NOT write it (because of Premise 1).\n\nSince we don't know definitively whether the book is a mystery novel or not, we can't definitively say whether James wrote it.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
