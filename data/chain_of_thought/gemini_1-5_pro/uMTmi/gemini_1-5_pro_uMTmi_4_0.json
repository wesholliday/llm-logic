This means it's possible the robot did NOT visit Jupiter.\n* **Now consider Statement 1:**  If the robot did NOT visit Jupiter, then the first part of Statement 1 (alien visited Mars) cannot be true.  Why? Because Statement 1 sets up a conditional where the robot visiting Jupiter is guaranteed if the alien visited Mars. \n\n**Answer: Yes** \n"
