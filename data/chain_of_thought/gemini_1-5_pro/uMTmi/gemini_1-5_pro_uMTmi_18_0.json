The doll could be plastic, or it could be something else. \n* **Possibility 2: The truck was not metal.** If this is true, Statement 1 tells us the doll couldn't have been plastic. If it were, the truck would have to be metal.\n\nSince we have at least one possibility where the doll is not plastic, we can't definitively say the doll was plastic.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
