This means there's a possibility the mummy WAS awake, and a possibility the mummy WAS NOT awake.\n* **Consider Fact 1:** This fact only applies IF the vampire was awake. It doesn't tell us anything definitive if the vampire was asleep. \n* **Putting it together:** Since the mummy might have been awake OR asleep, we don't have enough information to say for sure whether the vampire was awake or not. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
