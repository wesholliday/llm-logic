This doesn't directly tell us anything about the cake. \n\nEven if the muffins weren't blueberry, Statement 1 only tells us what happens IF the cake WAS chocolate. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the cake WASN'T chocolate. \n\nTherefore, we can't definitively say the cake wasn't chocolate.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
