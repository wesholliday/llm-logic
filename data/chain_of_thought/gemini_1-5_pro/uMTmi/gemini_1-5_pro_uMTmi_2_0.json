This doesn't rule out the possibility that the unicorn *was* in the forest. \n\nIf the unicorn *was* in the forest, Statement 1 doesn't give us any information about the griffin. The griffin could have been in the forest or not.\n\nSince we can't definitively say the griffin *must* have been absent, the answer is no.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
