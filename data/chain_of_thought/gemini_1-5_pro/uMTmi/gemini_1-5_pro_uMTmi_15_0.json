But Statement 2 says Erin might NOT have taken a train. This creates a contradiction. Therefore, Sam couldn't have taken a plane.\n\n* **Possibility 2: Sam did not take a plane.** This possibility aligns with both statements. Erin might or might not have taken a train; it doesn't contradict anything.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
