It's possible that something that \"crunks\" must also \"wump\", in which case the inference would be valid. However, it's also possible that \"wump\" and \"crunk\" are entirely unrelated, in which case the inference wouldn't hold.  Since we lack the information to determine this, we cannot logically infer the statement. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
