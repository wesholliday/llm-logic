It's possible that \"wibble\" is synonymous with \"quazzle,\" in which case the inference would be valid. However, it's equally possible that \"wibble\" refers to something entirely different and unrelated to \"quazzle.\"  Since we cannot logically connect \"wibble\" to the original statement, we cannot make the inference. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
