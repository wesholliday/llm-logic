This means it's possible the watch is NOT on his wrist, but it doesn't confirm it's definitely not.\n* **Statement 2:** Either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser. This presents two mutually exclusive possibilities, one of which MUST be true.\n\nConsidering both statements:\n\n* Statement 1 leaves the possibility of the watch being somewhere other than his wrist.\n* Statement 2 forces us to choose between two options, and since Statement 1 makes one option uncertain, we are left with the other.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
