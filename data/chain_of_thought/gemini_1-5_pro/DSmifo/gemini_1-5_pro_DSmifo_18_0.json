This means it's possible the notebook is NOT on the nightstand.\n* **Statement 2:** Either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer. This presents two options, and at least one MUST be true.\n\nNow let's combine the information:\n\n* Statement 1 allows for the possibility that the notebook is NOT on the nightstand.\n* If the notebook is NOT on the nightstand, Statement 2 forces the other option to be true: the notebook IS in the drawer. \n\nTherefore, we can logically conclude...\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
