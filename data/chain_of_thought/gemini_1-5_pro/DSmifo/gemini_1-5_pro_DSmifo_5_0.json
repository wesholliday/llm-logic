This means it's possible the cookies are NOT in the pantry, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that they ARE in the pantry.\n\n* **Statement 2:** Either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar. This presents two exclusive possibilities: cookies in the pantry, or cookies in the jar.\n\nNow let's combine the information:\n\n* Statement 1 leaves the possibility of the cookies being in the pantry open. \n* Statement 2 says IF the cookies are NOT in the pantry, they MUST be in the jar.\n\nTherefore, even though the cookies \"might not\" be in the pantry, if they aren't, they must be in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
