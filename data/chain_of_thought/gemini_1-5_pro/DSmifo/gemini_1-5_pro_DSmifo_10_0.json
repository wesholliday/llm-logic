This means it's possible the sock isn't under the bed, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that it is.\n* **Statement 2:** Either the missing sock must be under the bed or it's in the laundry basket. This presents two exclusive possibilities, one of which must be true.\n\nNow, since Statement 1 doesn't definitively rule out the sock being under the bed, we have to consider Statement 2.  Statement 2 says the sock MUST be in one of those two locations. \n\nTherefore, if it's not under the bed (as Statement 1 allows for), then Statement 2 forces the sock to be in the laundry basket.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
