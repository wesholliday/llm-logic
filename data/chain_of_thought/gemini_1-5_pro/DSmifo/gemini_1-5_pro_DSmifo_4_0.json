This means it's possible the cat isn't in the bedroom, but doesn't confirm it.\n* **Statement 2:** Either the cat is playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch. This presents two exclusive possibilities.\n\nSince Statement 1 doesn't rule out the cat being in the bedroom, we can't definitively say the cat is on the couch. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
