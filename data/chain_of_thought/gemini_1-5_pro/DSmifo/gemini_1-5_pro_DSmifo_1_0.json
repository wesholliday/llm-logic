Fido is in one place OR the other, but not both.\n\nNow let's combine the information:\n\n* Statement 1 leaves open the possibility that Fido IS in the garden.\n* Statement 2 says IF Fido IS in the garden, then he can't be inside. \n* However, Statement 1 also leaves open the possibility that Fido is NOT in the garden.\n* Statement 2 says IF Fido is NOT in the garden, then he MUST be inside.\n\nTherefore, since Fido might not be in the garden, he must be inside.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
