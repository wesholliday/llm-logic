This means it's possible the toy is NOT on the bookshelf, but it doesn't tell us where it IS.\n* **Statement 2:** Either the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box. This gives us two possibilities, and states one of them MUST be true.\n\nNow let's combine the information:\n\n* Statement 1 leaves open the possibility that the toy is NOT on the bookshelf.\n* Statement 2 tells us IF the toy is NOT on the bookshelf, it MUST be in the toy box. \n\nTherefore, since we can't be sure the toy IS on the bookshelf, we know it must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
