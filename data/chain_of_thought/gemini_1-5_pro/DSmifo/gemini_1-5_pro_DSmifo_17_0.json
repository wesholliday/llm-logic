This means it's possible the scarf is NOT on the coat rack, but it doesn't tell us where it IS.\n* **Statement 2:** Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack. This presents two exclusive possibilities, one of which MUST be true.\n\nSince Statement 1 leaves open the possibility that the scarf is NOT on the coat rack, and Statement 2 requires one of the two locations to be true, we can logically conclude that the scarf must be in the backpack.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
