This means it's possible the piece is NOT on the floor, but it doesn't confirm it's anywhere else.\n* **Statement 2:** Either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box. This gives us two possibilities, but doesn't tell us which is true.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nEven though the first statement makes it seem less likely the piece is on the floor, it doesn't rule it out.  The second statement tells us those are the ONLY two options.  Therefore, we can't definitively say the piece is in the box.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
