This means it's possible the remote is NOT under the couch, but it doesn't confirm its location.\n* **Statement 2:** Either the remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table. This presents two exclusive possibilities, and one MUST be true.\n\nSince Statement 1 doesn't rule out the remote being under the couch, it doesn't automatically make the second option in Statement 2 true. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
