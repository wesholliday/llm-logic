This means it's possible the umbrella is NOT in the closet, but it doesn't tell us where it IS.\n* **Statement 2:** Either the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet or it is in the car. This presents two exclusive possibilities, one of which MUST be true.\n\nSince Statement 1 leaves open the possibility of the umbrella NOT being in the closet, Statement 2 forces us to consider the other option within its 'either/or' structure. \n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
