This means it's possible the newspaper is NOT on the porch, but it doesn't tell us where it IS.\n* **Statement 2:** Either the newspaper must be sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway. This gives us two possibilities, and says one of them MUST be true.\n\nNow let's combine the information:\n\n* Statement 1 leaves open the possibility that the newspaper is NOT on the porch.\n* Statement 2 says IF the newspaper is NOT on the porch, it MUST be in the driveway.\n\nTherefore, since we can't be sure the newspaper IS on the porch, we know it must be in the driveway.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
