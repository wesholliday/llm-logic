This means it's possible the book is NOT on the table, but it doesn't tell us where it IS.\n* **Statement 2:** Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf. This gives us two possibilities, and says one of them MUST be true.\n\nSince Statement 1 leaves open the possibility that the book is NOT on the table, Statement 2 forces us to conclude the other possibility must be true. \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
