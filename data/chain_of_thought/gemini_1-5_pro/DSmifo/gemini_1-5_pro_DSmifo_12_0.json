This means it's possible the jacket isn't in the closet, but it doesn't confirm it. \n* **Statement 2:** Either the jacket must be hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair. This presents two exclusive possibilities, one of which must be true.\n\nNow, Statement 1 introduces the possibility that the jacket isn't in the closet.  Since Statement 2 requires one of the two locations to be true, if the jacket isn't in the closet, it *must* be on the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
