The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\".\n* **The contrapositive and the original statement are logically equivalent:** This means if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nApplying this to our problem:\n\n1. **Original statement:** If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\n2. **Contrapositive:** If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged.\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement...\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
