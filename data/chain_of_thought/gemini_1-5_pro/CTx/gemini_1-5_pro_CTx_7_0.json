            "content": "Let's break down this logic problem:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked. This is a conditional statement, often written as \"If P, then Q\" where:\n    * P = the whiffle was shanked\n    * Q = the whiffle tinked\n\n* **Statement to infer:** If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked. This is also a conditional statement:\n    * Not Q = the whiffle did not tink\n    * Not P = the whiffle was not shanked\n\n* **Logical relationship:** The relationship between the original statement and the inference is that they are contrapositives of each other.  The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n* **Validity of contrapositives:** In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
