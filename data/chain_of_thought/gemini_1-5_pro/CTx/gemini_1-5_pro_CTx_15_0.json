The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n* **Crucially, the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.** If one is true, the other must also be true.\n\n**Therefore:**\n\nSince the question asks about the contrapositive of the given statement, and the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original...\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
