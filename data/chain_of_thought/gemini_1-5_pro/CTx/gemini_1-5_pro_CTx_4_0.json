The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n* **The contrapositive and the original statement are logically equivalent:** If one is true, the other must also be true. \n\n**Therefore:** Since the question asks about the contrapositive of the given statement, and the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original...\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
