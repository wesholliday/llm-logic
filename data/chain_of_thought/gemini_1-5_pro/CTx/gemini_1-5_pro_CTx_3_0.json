This is a conditional statement, often written as \"If P, then Q\" where:\n    * P: The splat was morphed.\n    * Q: The splat quanked.\n\n* **Statement to infer:** If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed. This can be written as \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n* **Logical relationship:**  The relationship between \"If P, then Q\" and \"If not Q, then not P\" is called the contrapositive.  The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
