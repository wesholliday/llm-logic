The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n* **Crucially, the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.** This means if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, since the question asks for the contrapositive of the given statement, and the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original...\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
