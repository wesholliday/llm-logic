            "content": "Let's break down this logic problem:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled. This sets up a conditional relationship where cranking is sufficient to guarantee daggling.\n\n* **Contrapositive:** The question asks about the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive flips the conditions and negates them.  The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\n* **Applying the contrapositive:** In our case, the contrapositive becomes: If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\n\n* **Validity:** The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. If one is true, the other must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
