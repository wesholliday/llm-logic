            "content": "Let's break down this logic problem:\n\n* **We're dealing with a conditional statement:** \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\" This sets up a relationship where blumming the flug guarantees it was zimmed.\n* **We're asked about the contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement flips the parts of the statement and negates both.  The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\".\n* **The contrapositive and the original statement are logically equivalent:** This means if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\n**Applying this to our problem:**\n\n1. **Original statement:** If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\n2. **Contrapositive:** If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed.\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
