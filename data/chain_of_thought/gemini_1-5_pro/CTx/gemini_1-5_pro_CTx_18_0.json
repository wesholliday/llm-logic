            "content": "Let's break down this logic problem:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.  This sets up a conditional relationship where \"plooked\" implies \"nugged\".\n\n* **Question:** Can we infer \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked\"? This is asking if the reverse of the original statement is also true.\n\n* **Reasoning:**  This is about the concept of the contrapositive in logic. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\". The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n* **Applying to our problem:**  Since the question is asking for the contrapositive of the original statement, and the contrapositive is always logically equivalent, the answer must be yes.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
