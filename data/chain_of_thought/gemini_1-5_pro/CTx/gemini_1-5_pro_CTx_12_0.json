The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\".\n\nIn our case:\n\n* **Original:** If the smip was shripped (A), then the smip lupped the zoint (B).\n* **Contrapositive:** If the smip did not lup the zoint (not B), then the smip was not shripped (not A).\n\n**The key is:** The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. If the original is true, the contrapositive is true, and vice versa.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
