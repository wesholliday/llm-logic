This has the form \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n* **The contrapositive and the original statement are logically equivalent:** This means if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true. \n\n**Therefore:** Because the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can infer the statement in the question.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
