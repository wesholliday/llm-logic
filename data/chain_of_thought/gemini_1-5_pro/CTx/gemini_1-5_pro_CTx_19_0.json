            "content": "Let's break down this logic problem:\n\n* **We're dealing with a hypothetical:**  The words \"smonk,\" \"vreebled,\" and \"plagged\" are made up. This tells us we only need to focus on the structure of the statements, not their actual meaning.\n\n* **Consider it like a code:**  Replace the made-up words with letters to make the logic clearer:\n    * If P, then Q  (If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged)\n    * Can we infer: If not Q, then not P? (If the smonk did not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled?)\n\n* **This is about the contrapositive:** In logic, the contrapositive of a statement switches the order and negates both parts. The contrapositive of a true statement is always true.\n\n* **Our example and its contrapositive:**\n    * Original: If P, then Q\n    * Contrapositive: If not Q, then not P\n\nSince the second statement is the contrapositive of the first, and the contrapositive is always true if the original is true, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
