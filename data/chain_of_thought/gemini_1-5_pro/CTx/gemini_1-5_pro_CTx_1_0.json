            "content": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled. This is a classic \"If P, then Q\" statement, where:\n    * P = the flugel was blimmed\n    * Q = the flugel was zargled\n\n* **Statement to infer:** If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed. This is saying \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n* **Logical Equivalence:**  In logic, the statement \"If P, then Q\" is logically equivalent to \"If not Q, then not P\". This is called the contrapositive.\n\n**Answer: Yes** \n"
