            "content": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n1. **Original statement:** If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled. This sets up a conditional relationship where \"sproinged\" is a sufficient condition for \"garpled\". \n\n2. **Statement to infer:** If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged. This is looking at the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n3. **Contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and conclusion, and reversing their order.  If the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also always true.\n\n4. **Applying to our example:** The contrapositive of \"If sproinged, then garpled\" is indeed \"If not garpled, then not sproinged\".\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
