            "content": "Explanation: The original statement says the room MUST have been cleaned daily.  This means daily cleaning was mandatory, not optional. The new statement adds a second option for cleaning: upon request.  Since daily cleaning was mandatory according to the first statement, allowing for cleaning upon request makes the new statement less strict than the original.  We cannot infer a less strict statement from a stricter one. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
