Both statements use the same terms (\"plimp\", \"zibble\", \"snizzle\", \"quank\", \"wumble\") and structure (\"might be\", \"and\"). The only difference is the phrasing \u2013 the second statement combines the two \"might be\" clauses of the first. This restructuring doesn't change the meaning, as it still conveys the possibility of both the plimp being zibble and the snizzle quanking wumble. \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
