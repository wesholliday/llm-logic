Both sentences deal with the possibility of certain events. \n\n* **Sentence 1:**  Presents two separate possibilities:\n    * The zizz might be snizzle on quank.\n    * The wibble might wump fizzle quimble.\n\n* **Sentence 2:** Combines these possibilities into a single statement, suggesting both could be true simultaneously. \n\nSince the first sentence states each event as a possibility, it's logically sound to combine them as simultaneous possibilities in the second sentence. \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
