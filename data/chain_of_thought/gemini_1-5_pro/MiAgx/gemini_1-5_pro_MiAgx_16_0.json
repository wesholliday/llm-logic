Both sentences discuss the possibility (\"might\") of the snorkel having a certain property (\"grooble frazzle\") and the quibble performing a certain action (\"blimple\"). The difference lies in the second sentence combining the actions of the quibble. However, the first sentence doesn't tell us whether the quibble performs these actions together or separately. Therefore, we cannot definitively say the second sentence is a guaranteed inference. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
