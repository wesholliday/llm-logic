The use of \"might\" indicates uncertainty for both.\n* **Inference:** \"It might be that the quimble is plonk and the snork wozzles to be plimp\" - This rephrases the original sentence, emphasizing the uncertainty of both possibilities occurring together. \n\nSince the original sentence states both possibilities with uncertainty, combining them with \"It might be that...\" accurately reflects the original meaning.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
