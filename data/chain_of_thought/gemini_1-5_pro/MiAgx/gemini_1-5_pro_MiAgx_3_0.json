Both statements discuss the possibility (\"might\") of two events: the blimp being in the wozzle and the flonk quibbling plonk. The structure of both statements is essentially the same, just worded slightly differently. Since the meaning is consistent, the second statement can be inferred from the first. \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
