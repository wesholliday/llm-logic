Both sentences convey the same basic idea: there's a possibility of the quibble having certain characteristics and the zump performing a certain action. The only difference is the phrasing. The first sentence uses \"might be\" and \"might quork,\" while the second uses \"It might be that\" and \"quorks.\" This difference in phrasing doesn't change the fundamental meaning. Both sentences express uncertainty and possibility about the same events.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
