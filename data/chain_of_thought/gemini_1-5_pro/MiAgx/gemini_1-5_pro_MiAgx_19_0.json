            "content": "Explanation: We need to determine if the two sentences convey the same meaning. Both sentences discuss the possibility of two things: 1) the crunk being \"wibble fribble\" and 2) the frazzle \"quorking snork\". The structure of both sentences indicates uncertainty, using \"might be\" in the first and \"It might be that\" in the second.  Since the core components and uncertainty are the same, the meaning is equivalent.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
