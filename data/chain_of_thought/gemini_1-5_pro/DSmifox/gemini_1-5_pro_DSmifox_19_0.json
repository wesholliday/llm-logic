This means it's possible the smonk is plagged, and it's possible it isn't.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled. This presents two options, and at least one must be true.\n\nNow let's consider the possibilities:\n\n* **Possibility 1: The smonk is plagged.** This satisfies Premise 2, and doesn't contradict Premise 1.\n* **Possibility 2: The smonk is not plagged.** This means, according to Premise 2, the smonk MUST be vreebled.\n\nSince Possibility 2 leads us to the conclusion that the smonk is vreebled, we can infer this is a valid conclusion.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
