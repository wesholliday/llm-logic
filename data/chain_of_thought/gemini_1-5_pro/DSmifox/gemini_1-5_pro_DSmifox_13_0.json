This means it's possible the glip is not tragged, but it doesn't tell us for sure.\n* **Statement 2:** Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged. This presents two mutually exclusive possibilities: either the glip is tragged, or it is slogged.\n\nNow, let's consider if we can infer \"The glip is slogged\":\n\n* Statement 1 allows for the possibility that the glip is NOT tragged. \n* If the glip is NOT tragged, then according to Statement 2, it MUST be slogged.\n\nTherefore, we can logically conclude...\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
