This means it's possible the whiffle is not tinked, but it doesn't tell us for sure.\n* **Statement 2:** Either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked. This gives us two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n\nNow let's consider if the whiffle is not tinked (from statement 1). If that's the case, then statement 2 tells us it MUST be shanked. \n\nTherefore, we can confidently conclude that the whiffle is indeed shanked.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
