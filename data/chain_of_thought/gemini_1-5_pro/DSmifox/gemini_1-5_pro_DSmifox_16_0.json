This means it's possible the sneg is not sproted, but it doesn't tell us for sure.\n* **Statement 2:** Either the sneg must be sproted or it is crampled. This gives us two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n\nNow let's consider the possibilities:\n\n* **Possibility 1: The sneg is sproted.** This would satisfy Statement 2, but it might contradict Statement 1 (which says it *might not* be sproted).\n* **Possibility 2: The sneg is not sproted.**  In this case, to satisfy Statement 2 (the \"either/or\"), the sneg MUST be crampled.\n\nSince Possibility 2 is valid and leads to the conclusion \"The sneg is crampled\", we can infer this statement.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
