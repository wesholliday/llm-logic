This means it's possible the clug is not snugged, but doesn't guarantee it.\n* **Statement 2:** Either the clug must be snugged or it is fleeked. This presents two mutually exclusive possibilities: either the clug is snugged, or it is fleeked.\n\nNow let's consider if we can conclude \"The clug is fleeked\":\n\n* **Scenario 1: The clug is not snugged.**  Statement 2 tells us if it's not snugged, it MUST be fleeked.\n* **Scenario 2: The clug is snugged.** Statement 2 allows for this possibility, and if it's snugged, it cannot be fleeked.\n\nSince we don't know definitively whether the clug is snugged or not, we can't definitively say it's fleeked.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
