This means it's possible the fribble is not crinked.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the fribble must be crinked or it is snurgled. This gives us two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n* **Putting them together:** Since the fribble might not be crinked (from Premise 1), and one of the two options in Premise 2 *must* be true, the only remaining possibility is that the fribble is snurgled.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
