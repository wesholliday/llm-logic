This means it's possible the grommet is not plopped, but it doesn't guarantee it.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed. This tells us there are only two possibilities: plopped or sploffed.\n* **Putting it together:** Since the grommet might not be plopped (Premise 1), and it has to be either plopped or sploffed (Premise 2), the only remaining possibility is that it is sploffed.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
