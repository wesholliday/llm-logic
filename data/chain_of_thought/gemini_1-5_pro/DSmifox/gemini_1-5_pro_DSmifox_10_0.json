It doesn't guarantee it's not garpled, just that it's a possibility.\n\n**Statement 2:** Either the wug must be garpled or it is sproinged.\n* This presents two mutually exclusive options for the wug: garpled or sproinged. One of these MUST be true.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* If the wug is not garpled (as allowed by Statement 1), then Statement 2 forces the wug to be sproinged. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
