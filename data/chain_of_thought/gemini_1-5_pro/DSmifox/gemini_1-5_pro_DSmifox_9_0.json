This means it's possible the twonk is not plinked, but doesn't guarantee it.\n\n* **Statement 2:** Either the twonk must be plinked or it is varnished. This presents two options, one of which must be true.\n\nNow let's consider the possibilities:\n\n* **Possibility 1: The twonk is plinked.** This satisfies Statement 2, and doesn't contradict Statement 1.\n\n* **Possibility 2: The twonk is not plinked.**  Statement 2 says if it's not plinked, it MUST be varnished.\n\nSince Possibility 2 directly leads to the conclusion \"The twonk is varnished\", and Possibility 1 doesn't contradict it, we can infer the twonk is indeed varnished.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
