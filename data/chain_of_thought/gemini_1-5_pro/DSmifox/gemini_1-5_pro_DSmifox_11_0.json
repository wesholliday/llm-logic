This means it's possible the flug is not zimmed, but it doesn't guarantee it.\n* **Statement 2:** Either the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed. This presents two exclusive possibilities, one of which must be true.\n\nNow let's consider how these statements interact:\n\n* **Possibility 1:** The flug is not zimmed (from Statement 1). If this is true, then according to Statement 2, the flug MUST be blummed.\n* **Possibility 2:** The flug is zimmed (contradicting Statement 1). This possibility is allowed, but it doesn't tell us anything about whether the flug is blummed or not.\n\nSince Possibility 1 leads to the conclusion that the flug is blummed, and Possibility 2 doesn't contradict it, we can infer that the flug is indeed blummed.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
