The wug is either bimmed, or it's flooped.\n\nNow let's combine the information:\n\n* Statement 1 leaves open the possibility that the wug IS bimmed. \n* If the wug IS bimmed, then statement 2 is still true (because it said \"either/or\"). \n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively say the wug is flooped.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
