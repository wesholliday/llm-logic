(This means it's possible the flob is not movated).\n\n2. **Premise 2:** Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled. (This presents two exclusive possibilities).\n\n3. **Consider the possibilities:**\n    * **Possibility A:** The flob is NOT movated. If this is true, then according to Premise 2, the flob MUST be skizzled.\n    * **Possibility B:** The flob IS movated.  This possibility doesn't contradict our premises, but it also doesn't tell us for sure if the flob is skizzled or not. \n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since Possibility A shows that the flob being skizzled is a valid outcome, we cannot definitively say \"The flob IS skizzled.\"\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
