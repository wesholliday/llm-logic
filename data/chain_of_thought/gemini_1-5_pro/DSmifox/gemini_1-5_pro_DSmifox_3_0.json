However, we don't know if the splat is ALSO morphed.\n* **Scenario 2: The splat IS NOT quanked.** Statement 2 tells us if it's NOT quanked, it MUST be morphed.\n\nSince we don't know definitively if the splat is quanked or not, only one scenario leads to the conclusion \"The splat is morphed\". \n\nAnswer: no \n"
