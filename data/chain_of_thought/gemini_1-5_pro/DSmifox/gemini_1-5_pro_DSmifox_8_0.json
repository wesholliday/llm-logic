This means it's possible the sprocket is NOT daggled, but it doesn't tell us for sure.\n* **Statement 2:** Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked. This gives us two possibilities, and at least one MUST be true.\n\nNow let's consider the possibilities:\n\n* **Possibility 1: Sprocket is daggled.** This satisfies Statement 2. However, it might contradict Statement 1, which allows for the sprocket to NOT be daggled.\n* **Possibility 2: Sprocket is NOT daggled.** This agrees with Statement 1. To satisfy Statement 2 (at least one part must be true), the sprocket MUST be cranked.\n\nTherefore, if the sprocket is not daggled, it must be cranked to satisfy both statements.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
