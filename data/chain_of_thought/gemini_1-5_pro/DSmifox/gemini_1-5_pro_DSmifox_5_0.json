This means it's possible the zinger is NOT smoogled. \n* **Statement 2:** Either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled. This gives us two possibilities:\n    * **Possibility A:** The zinger IS smoogled.\n    * **Possibility B:** The zinger IS fraggled.\n\nNow let's consider if Statement 1 completely eliminates Possibility A. It doesn't. Statement 1 only tells us smoogling is not guaranteed, not that it's impossible. \n\nSince Possibility A (the zinger IS smoogled) is still on the table, we can't definitively say Possibility B (the zinger IS fraggled) MUST be true.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
