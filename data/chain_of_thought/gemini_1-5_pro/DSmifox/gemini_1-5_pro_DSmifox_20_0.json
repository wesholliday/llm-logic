This means it's possible the fleeg is NOT surned.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered. This gives us two possibilities, and one MUST be true.\n\nNow let's consider the possibilities:\n\n* **Possibility 1: The fleeg is NOT surned.**  Premise 2 says it MUST be surned OR bluttered. If it's NOT surned, then it MUST be bluttered.\n* **Possibility 2: The fleeg IS surned.** This possibility doesn't contradict our premises.\n\nSince Possibility 1 leads us to the conclusion that the fleeg is bluttered, we can definitively say:\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
