This means there are two possibilities: \n    * The splat is quanked.\n    * The splat is morphed.\n* **Statement 2:** The splat might not be quanked. This tells us that the first possibility in Statement 1 (the splat is quanked) might not be true. \n\nSince the first possibility might not be true, and we know one of the two possibilities MUST be true, this forces the second possibility to be true.\n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
