This means one of these two things MUST be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The shank might not be nugged. This means it's POSSIBLE the shank isn't nugged. \n\nNow let's consider the possibilities:\n\n* **Possibility 1: The shank IS nugged.** This would make Premise 1 true, but Premise 2 false. Since we're given both premises, this can't be the case.\n* **Possibility 2: The shank IS NOT nugged.** This makes Premise 2 true.  Since Premise 1 says one of the options MUST be true, and we've ruled out 'nugged', then 'plooked' must be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
