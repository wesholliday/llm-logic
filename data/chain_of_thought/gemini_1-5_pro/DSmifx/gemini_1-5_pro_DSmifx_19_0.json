This means at least one of these conditions must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The smonk might not be plagged. This introduces the possibility that the first condition in Premise 1 is false. \n\nNow, if the smonk might NOT be plagged (Premise 2), and at least one of the conditions in Premise 1 MUST be true, then the remaining condition (vreebled) must be true to satisfy Premise 1.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
