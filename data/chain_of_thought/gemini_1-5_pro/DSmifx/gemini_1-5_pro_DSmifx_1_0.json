This means at least one of the two options must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The flugel might not be zargled. This means it's possible that the flugel is not zargled. \n\nNow, if the flugel might NOT be zargled (Premise 2), and one of the two options MUST be true (Premise 1), then the remaining option (blimmed) must be true to satisfy the conditions.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
