This means it has to be one or the other, or possibly both.\n* **Premise 2:** The whiffle might not be tinked. This introduces the possibility that the whiffle is NOT tinked. \n\n* **Reasoning:** Since Premise 1 states it MUST be tinked OR shanked, and Premise 2 allows for it NOT being tinked, the only remaining possibility is that it MUST be shanked.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
