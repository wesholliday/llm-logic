This presents two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n* **Statement 2:** The wug might not be garpled. This introduces uncertainty about the first possibility in Statement 1. \n\nNow, let's consider if we can definitively say \"The wug is sproinged.\"\n\n* If the wug might not be garpled (Statement 2), it's still possible that it IS garpled. \n* Since Statement 1 allows for either possibility, the wug being garpled would still satisfy the conditions.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively say the wug IS sproinged.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
