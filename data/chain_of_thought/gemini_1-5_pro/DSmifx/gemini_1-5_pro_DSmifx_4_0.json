This means there are two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n* **Statement 2:** The fribble might not be crinked. This introduces the possibility that the first part of Statement 1 might be false.\n\nNow, if the fribble might not be crinked, then according to Statement 1, it MUST be snurgled for the statement to hold true. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
