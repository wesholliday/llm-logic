This means there are two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The zinger might not be smoogled. This tells us that the first possibility in Premise 1 is not guaranteed. \n\nHowever, just because the zinger *might* not be smoogled doesn't automatically mean it *is* fraggled.  Premise 1 only states that *at least one* of the options must be true, not that the second option is true if the first is false. \n\n**Answer:** no \n"
