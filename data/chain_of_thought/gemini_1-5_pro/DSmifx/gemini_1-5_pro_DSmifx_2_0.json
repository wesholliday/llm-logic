This means there are two possibilities:\n    * **Possibility 1:** The wug is bimmed.\n    * **Possibility 2:** The wug is flooped.\n\n* **Statement 2:** The wug might not be bimmed. This tells us that Possibility 1 (the wug being bimmed) is not certain. \n\nHowever, just because the wug might not be bimmed doesn't automatically mean it MUST be flooped. Statement 1 only tells us that one of the two options must be true, not that if one is false the other MUST be true. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
