This means at least one of the two options must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The smip might not be lupped. This introduces the possibility that the first option in Premise 1 might not be true. \n\nNow, if the first option (smip being lupped) might not be true, then for Premise 1 to still hold, the second option (smip being shripped) *must* be true. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
