This means there are two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The sneg might not be sproted. This tells us that one of the possibilities in Premise 1 (the sneg being sproted) is not guaranteed. \n\nHowever, just because the sneg *might* not be sproted doesn't automatically mean it *is* crampled. Premise 1 leaves open the possibility that the sneg is BOTH sproted and crampled. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
