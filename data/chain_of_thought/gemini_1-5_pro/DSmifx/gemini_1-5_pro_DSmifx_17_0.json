This means one of these two things MUST be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The flob might not be movated. This means it's POSSIBLE the flob isn't movated. \n\nNow, if the flob might NOT be movated (Premise 2), and one of the two options in Premise 1 MUST be true, then it's possible that \"the flob is skizzled\" is the true option. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
