This means there are two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n* **Statement 2:** The clug might not be snugged. This introduces uncertainty about the first possibility in Statement 1.\n\nNow, let's consider if we can definitively say \"The clug is fleeked.\"\n\n* If the clug is not snugged (as Statement 2 allows), then Statement 1 forces the clug to be fleeked. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
