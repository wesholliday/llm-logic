This means at least one of the following must be true:\n    * The twonk is varnished.\n    * The twonk is plinked.\n* **Premise 2:** The twonk might not be plinked. This means it's possible that the twonk is NOT plinked. \n\nNow, if the twonk might NOT be plinked (Premise 2), and at least one of the options in Premise 1 MUST be true, then it strengthens the possibility that the remaining option (the twonk is varnished) is true. \n\nHowever, it doesn't definitively prove that the twonk IS varnished. Premise 2 only tells us plinking is not guaranteed, not that it's impossible.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
