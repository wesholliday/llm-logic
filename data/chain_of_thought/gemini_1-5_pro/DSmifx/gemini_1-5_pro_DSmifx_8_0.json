This means at least one of these options must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The sprocket might not be daggled. This means it's possible the sprocket is not daggled. \n\nNow, if the sprocket might NOT be daggled (Premise 2), and Premise 1 states it MUST be either daggled OR cranked, then the only remaining possibility is that the sprocket is cranked. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
