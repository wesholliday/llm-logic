This means at least one of the two options must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The dreb might not be spened. This tells us that it's possible the dreb is not spened. \n\nNow, if the dreb might NOT be spened (Premise 2), and at least one of the options in Premise 1 MUST be true, then the remaining option (vroombed) must be true to satisfy the conditions.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
