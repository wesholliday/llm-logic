This presents two possibilities:\n    * **Possibility A:** The flug is zimmed.\n    * **Possibility B:** The flug is blummed.\n\n* **Statement 2:** The flug might not be zimmed. This tells us that Possibility A (from Statement 1) might not be true. \n\n* **Reasoning:** If Possibility A might not be true, then Possibility B (the flug is blummed) becomes the more likely option. However, Statement 2 doesn't completely rule out the possibility of the flug being zimmed. \n\n**Answer:** no \n"
