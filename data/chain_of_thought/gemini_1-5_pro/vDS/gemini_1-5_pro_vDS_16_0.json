This presents two possibilities, only one of which needs to be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The pen isn't on my desk. This eliminates one of the possibilities presented in Premise 1.\n* **Conclusion:** The pen is in my bag.  Since one possibility was ruled out, and we were told at least one possibility MUST be true, this is the only remaining option.\n\nThis follows a classic logical structure called a disjunctive syllogism.\n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
