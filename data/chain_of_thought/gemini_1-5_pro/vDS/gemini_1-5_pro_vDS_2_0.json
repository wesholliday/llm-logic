This presents two possibilities, only one of which needs to be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The book isn't resting on the table. This eliminates one of the possibilities presented in Premise 1. \n* **Conclusion:** The book is on the shelf.  Since one possibility was eliminated, and only one other possibility remains, the conclusion follows logically.\n\nThis is a classic example of a valid argument form called *disjunctive syllogism*.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
