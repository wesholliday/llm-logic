This presents two possibilities, only one of which needs to be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The milk isn't chilling in the fridge. This eliminates one of the possibilities presented in Premise 1.\n* **Conclusion:** The milk is on the counter.  Since one possibility was eliminated, this conclusion deduces the only remaining possibility.\n\nThis follows a classic logical structure called a disjunctive syllogism. If one premise presents two options, and the other premise eliminates one option, the remaining option must be true.\n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
