Here's why it's valid:\n\n1. **Disjunction:** The first premise presents two possibilities connected by \"or\".  Only one of these possibilities needs to be true for the entire statement to be true.\n\n2. **Elimination:** The second premise eliminates one of the possibilities presented in the first premise.\n\n3. **Deduction:** Since one possibility has been ruled out, and we know at least one *must* be true, the remaining possibility must be the correct one.\n\n**Answer: Yes** \n"
