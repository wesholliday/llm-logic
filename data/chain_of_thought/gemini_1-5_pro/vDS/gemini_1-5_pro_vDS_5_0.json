This presents two possibilities, only one of which needs to be true for the premise to hold.\n* **Premise 2:** The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry. This eliminates one of the possibilities presented in Premise 1.\n* **Conclusion:** The cookies are in the jar.  Since one possibility was eliminated, and we know at least one of the possibilities in Premise 1 must be true, this is the only remaining option.\n\nThis follows a classic logical structure called a disjunctive syllogism. If one or the other of two options must be true, and we eliminate one, the other must be the case.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
