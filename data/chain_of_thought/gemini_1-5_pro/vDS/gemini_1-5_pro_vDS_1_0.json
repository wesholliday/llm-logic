This presents two possibilities, and one of them must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** Fido is not in the garden. This eliminates one of the possibilities presented in Premise 1. \n* **Conclusion:** Fido is inside.  Since the garden option is ruled out, the only remaining possibility from Premise 1 must be true.\n\nThis argument follows a structure called \"disjunctive syllogism.\"  Disjunctive syllogisms are logically valid because if you have two options and eliminate one, the other must be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
