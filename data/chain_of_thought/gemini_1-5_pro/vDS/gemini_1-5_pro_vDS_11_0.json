This presents two possibilities.\n* **Premise 2:** The newspaper isn't sitting on the porch. This eliminates one of the possibilities.\n* **Conclusion:** The newspaper is in the driveway.  Since one possibility was ruled out, this is the only remaining option.\n\nThis argument structure follows a valid logical form called disjunctive syllogism. If one premise presents two options, and the other premise eliminates one option, the remaining option must be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
