This presents two possibilities, and one of them must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The shoes aren't lined up by the door. This eliminates one of the possibilities presented in Premise 1.\n* **Conclusion:** The shoes are in the closet.  Since one possibility was eliminated, this is the only remaining option.\n\nThis type of reasoning follows a valid logical structure called disjunctive syllogism. \n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
