This presents two possibilities.\n* **Premise 2:** The jacket isn't hanging in the closet. This eliminates one of the possibilities presented in Premise 1.\n* **Conclusion:** The jacket is draped over the chair.  Since one possibility was eliminated, this conclusion follows the remaining possibility.\n\nThis argument structure is called a disjunctive syllogism.  Disjunctive syllogisms are logically valid because if one premise presents two options and the other premise eliminates one option, the remaining option must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
