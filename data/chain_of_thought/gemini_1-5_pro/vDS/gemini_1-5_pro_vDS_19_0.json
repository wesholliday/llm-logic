This presents two possibilities, only one of which needs to be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The watch isn't on his wrist. This eliminates one of the possibilities presented in Premise 1.\n* **Conclusion:** The watch is charging on the dresser.  Since one possibility was eliminated, this conclusion follows the remaining possibility.\n\nThis argument structure is called a disjunctive syllogism.  Disjunctive syllogisms are logically valid because if you have two options and eliminate one, the other must be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
