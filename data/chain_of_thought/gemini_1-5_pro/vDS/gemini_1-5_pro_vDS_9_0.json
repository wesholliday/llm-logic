This sets up a classic \"either/or\" scenario.\n* **Premise 2:**  Eliminates one of the possibilities presented in Premise 1.  It tells us the piece is NOT on the floor.\n* **Conclusion:**  States that the remaining possibility from Premise 1 (being in the box) must be true.\n\nThis follows a valid logical structure. If one of two options must be true, and we eliminate one option, the other option must be the correct one.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
