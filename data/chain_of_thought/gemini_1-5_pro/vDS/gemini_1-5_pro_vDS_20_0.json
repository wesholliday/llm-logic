It's important to note that these possibilities are *not* mutually exclusive; it's possible the sunglasses are in both places.\n* **Premise 2** eliminates one of the possibilities. \n* Since one possibility has been ruled out, and we are left with only one other possibility stated in Premise 1, the conclusion logically follows.\n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
