The original sentence states the quorple must be on the plonk AND gribble a grazzle froodle.  We don't know the relationship between being \"on the plonk\" and \"gribbling a grazzle froodle.\"  It's possible these are two separate conditions that must both be met.  Therefore, we can't assume the second condition is true if we remove the first. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
