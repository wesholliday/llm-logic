However, the structure of the sentence tells us that \"wibble\" is a necessary condition for something to be considered \"zibble\". The sentence states that for a \"crunk\" to be \"zibble\", it must be \"wibble\".  Therefore, if a \"crunk\" is \"zibble\", it must also be \"wibble\". This doesn't mean that being \"zibble\" alone is enough to be considered \"wibble\". \n\nAnswer: no \n"
