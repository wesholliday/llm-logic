            "content": "Let's break this down:\n\n* **We're dealing with a logic puzzle.**  The words \"sneg,\" \"crampled,\" \"sproted,\" and \"frink\" are made up and have no inherent meaning. This helps us focus on the logical structure of the statements.\n\n* **Let's simplify:**\n    *  Replace \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink\" with \"If A, then B\" \n    * Replace \"It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink\" with \"Not B\"\n    * Replace \"The sneg was not crampled\" with \"Not A\"\n\n* **Now we have:**\n    *  If A, then B\n    *  Not B\n    *  Can we infer Not A?\n\n* **This is a classic logic form called Modus Tollens.**  Modus Tollens states that if we know \"If A then B\" is true, and we also know \"Not B\" is true, then we can conclude \"Not A\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
