IF the smonk was vreebled, THEN it must have plagged.  \n* **Consider Premise 2:** This tells us the \"then\" part of Premise 1 is NOT true. The smonk did NOT have to have plagged.\n* **Linking Premises:**  Since the \"then\" part of Premise 1 is false, and Premise 1 relies on that connection, we know the \"if\" part MUST also be false to make the whole statement valid.\n\n**Answer: Yes** \n"
