This helps us focus on the logical structure of the statements.\n\n* **Statement 1: \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\"**  This sets up a conditional relationship.  We can think of it like this:\n    *  Bluttered Fleeg  -> Surned Fleeg \n\n* **Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned.\"** This tells us that the fleeg being surned is not a certainty.\n\n* **The Question: \"Can we infer 'The fleeg was not bluttered'?\"**  To figure this out, let's consider the possibilities:\n\n    * **Possibility 1: The fleeg WAS bluttered.** If this is true, then according to Statement 1, it MUST have been surned. But Statement 2 tells us that's not necessarily true. This creates a contradiction.\n\n    * **Possibility 2: The fleeg WAS NOT bluttered.** This possibility doesn't contradict our given statements.  The fleeg could be surned for some other reason, or not at all.\n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
