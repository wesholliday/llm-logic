We can think of this like a rule:  Vroombed dreb --> Spened dreb.\n* **Statement 2:** It's not the case that the dreb must have been spened. This tells us the dreb wasn't necessarily spened.\n\nNow, if the dreb WAS vroombed (according to statement 1), it MUST have been spened. But statement 2 says it wasn't necessarily spened.  This means the dreb couldn't have been vroombed in the first place.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
