According to Statement 1, this would mean it must have been smoogled.\n* **Contradiction:** But Statement 2 tells us the zinger was *not* necessarily smoogled. \n* **The only way out:**  The only way both statements can be true is if our initial assumption (that the zinger was fraggled) is wrong.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
