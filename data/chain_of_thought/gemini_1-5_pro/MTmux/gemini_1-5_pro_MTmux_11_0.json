(If A, then B)\n* **Statement 2:** It's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed. (Not B)\n\nWe're asked if we can infer \"The flug was not blummed\" (Not A).\n\nThis follows the structure of a valid argument form called *Modus Tollens*:\n\n* If P, then Q\n* Not Q\n* Therefore, Not P\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P = The flug was blummed\n* Q = The flug must have been zimmed\n\nSince our statements match the structure of *Modus Tollens*, we can validly infer \"The flug was not blummed\".\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
