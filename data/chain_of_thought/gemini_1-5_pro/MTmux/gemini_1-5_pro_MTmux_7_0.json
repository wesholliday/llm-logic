(This is like saying \"If A, then B\")\n* **Statement 2:** It's not the case that the whiffle must have tinked. (This is like saying \"Not B\")\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude:\n\n* **Conclusion:** The whiffle was not shanked. (This is like saying \"Not A\")\n\nThis logical structure is similar to *modus tollens*. Modus tollens states that if we know \"If A, then B\" is true, and we also know \"Not B\" is true, then we can conclude \"Not A\" is true.\n\nIn our case, we have the structure of *modus tollens* and can therefore validly conclude \"The whiffle was not shanked\".\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
