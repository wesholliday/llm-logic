(If P, then V)\n* **Statement 2:** It's not the case that the twonk must have been varnished. (Not necessarily V)\n\nWe need to determine if these statements allow us to conclude:\n\n* **Conclusion:** The twonk was not plinked. (Not P)\n\nConsider this: just because the twonk wasn't *necessarily* varnished doesn't mean it *couldn't* have been varnished.  It could have been varnished for some other reason.  \n\nIf it *was* varnished, Statement 1 doesn't tell us anything definitive about whether it was plinked or not. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
