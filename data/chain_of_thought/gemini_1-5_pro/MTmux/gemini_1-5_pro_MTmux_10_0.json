(This is like saying \"Not B\")\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude:\n\n* **Conclusion:** The wug was not sproinged. (This is like saying \"Not A\")\n\nConsider this: If A leads to B, and we know B didn't happen, then A couldn't have happened either. This is the logic of *modus tollens*.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
