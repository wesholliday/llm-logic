It doesn't mean the banana is *always* yellow, just that it *would be* yellow *if* the apple were red.\n* **Statement 2:** \"Also, the apple was red.\" This confirms the condition mentioned in the first statement is met.\n\nSince the condition (apple being red) is met, and the statement links that condition to the banana being yellow, we can logically conclude the banana was indeed yellow.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
