This sets up a conditional statement where a red car implies a blue truck.\n* **Premise 2:** The car was red. This confirms the condition stated in the first premise.\n\nSince the condition (red car) is met, and the first premise links it to the conclusion (blue truck), we can logically infer the truck was blue.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
