This is a conditional statement, meaning it sets up a rule:  Griffin in forest \u2192 Unicorn in forest.\n* **Premise 2:** The griffin was in the forest. This confirms the \"if\" part of our rule from Premise 1.\n* **Conclusion:** Since the rule states that IF the griffin is in the forest, THEN the unicorn is too, and we know the griffin IS in the forest, the unicorn MUST be in the forest.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
