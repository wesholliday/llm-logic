This sets up a conditional statement where Tom watching football is the condition, and Jen watching basketball is the result.\n* **Premise 2:** Tom watched football. This tells us the condition from Premise 1 is met.\n* **Conclusion:** Since the condition of Premise 1 is met (Tom watched football), and Premise 1 states that IF the condition is met THEN the result happens, we can conclude that the result (Jen watched basketball) is true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
