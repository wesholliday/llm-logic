This sets up a conditional statement where Sue choosing pizza is the condition, and Bob choosing pasta is the result.\n* **Premise 2:** Sue chose pizza. This tells us the condition from Premise 1 is met.\n* **Conclusion:** Since the condition of Premise 1 is met (Sue chose pizza), the result must also be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
