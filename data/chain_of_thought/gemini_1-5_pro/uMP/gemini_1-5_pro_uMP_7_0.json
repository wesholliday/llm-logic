If we have a statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know \"P\" is true, then \"Q\" must also be true.\n\n* In our case, \"P\" is \"Alex finished the race\" \n* \"Q\" is \"Chris finished the race\".\n\nSince we know both \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" and \"Alex finished the race\" are true, we can conclude that \"Chris finished the race\".\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
