This sets up a conditional statement where Ben eating pasta is the condition, and Kate eating salad is the result.\n* **Premise 2:** Ben ate pasta. This tells us the condition from Premise 1 is met.\n* **Conclusion:** Since the condition of Premise 1 is met (Ben ate pasta), the result must also be true (Kate ate salad).\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
