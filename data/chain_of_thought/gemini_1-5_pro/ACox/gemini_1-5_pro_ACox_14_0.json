However, just because it *is* crinked doesn't automatically mean it was snurgled. There could be other reasons for a fribble to be crinked.\n\n**Example:** Imagine \"fribble\" is \"paper\" and \"crinkled\" is \"crumpled\".\n\n* Fact: The paper is crumpled.\n* Rule: If the paper was thrown in the trash, then the paper is crumpled.\n\nWe can't conclude the paper was thrown in the trash just because it's crumpled. Maybe someone sat on it!\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
