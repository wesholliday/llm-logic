It doesn't tell us the wug *was* sproinged.  It's possible the wug got garpled some other way.\n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine \"garpled\" means \"wet.\"  \n\n* Premise 1: The wug is wet.\n* Premise 2: If the wug was rained on, then it was wet.\n\nThe wug could be wet for other reasons (spilled drink, fell in a puddle).  We can't conclude it was rained on.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
