We also know that *if* Action 2 happened, *then* Action 1 definitely happened.  However, this doesn't mean Action 2 *must* have happened for Action 1 to occur. There could be other ways Action 1 happened.\n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine \"The door was closed\" and \"If the door was slammed, then the door was closed.\"  The door could have been closed gently, not slammed.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
