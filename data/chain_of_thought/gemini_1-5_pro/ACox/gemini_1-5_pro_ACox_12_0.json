'P' is the hypothesis, and 'Q' is the conclusion.\n* **Our problem fits this structure:**\n    * P: The wug was flooped.\n    * Q: The wug was bimmed.\n* **We're given \"Q is true.\"** The statement \"The wug was bimmed\" tells us this.\n* **Can we conclude \"P is true\" just because \"Q is true\"?**  No. Just because the conclusion of an \"If P, then Q\" statement is true, it doesn't mean the hypothesis must also be true. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
