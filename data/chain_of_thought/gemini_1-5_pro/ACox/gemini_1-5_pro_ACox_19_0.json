There could be other reasons it was varnished.  Premise 2 only tells us what happens if it WAS plinked.\n\n* **Example:** Imagine \"varnished\" means \"painted blue\" and \"plinked\" means \"struck with a hammer\".  \n    *  If something is painted blue, does that mean it MUST have been hit with a hammer first? No.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
