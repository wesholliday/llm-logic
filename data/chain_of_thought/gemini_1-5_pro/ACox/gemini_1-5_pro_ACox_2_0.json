(This tells us an action happened).\n* **Statement 2:** If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint. (This sets up a condition and a result).\n* **The question is:** Can we be SURE \"the wug was flooped\" is true based on these statements?\n\n**Here's the catch:** Just because the wug bimmed the zoint doesn't mean it *had* to be flooped to do so. There might be other reasons the wug bimmed the zoint. \n\n**Example:**  Maybe wugs always bim zoints on Tuesdays, regardless of being flooped.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
