It doesn't tell us the wug *was* sproinged.  It's possible the wug got garpled some other way.\n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine \"garpled\" means \"wet\" and \"sproinged\" means \"rained on.\"\n\n* Premise 1: The wug was wet.\n* Premise 2: If the wug was rained on, then it was wet.\n\nThe wug could be wet for other reasons (like being sprayed with a hose).\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
