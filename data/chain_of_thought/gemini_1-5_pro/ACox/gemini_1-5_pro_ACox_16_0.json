We know \"plopped\" happened (Premise 1), but that doesn't automatically mean \"sploffed\" happened.  There could be other ways to get to \"plopped\".\n\n**Example:** Imagine \"plopped\" means \"wet\".  Premise 2 says \"If it rained (sploffed), then the ground is wet (plopped)\".  We know the ground is wet, but that doesn't mean it rained.  Maybe someone sprayed it with a hose.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
