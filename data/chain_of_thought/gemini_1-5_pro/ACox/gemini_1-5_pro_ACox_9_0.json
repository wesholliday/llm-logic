There could be other reasons for it to be varnished.  Premise 2 only tells us what happens if it WAS plinked.\n\n* **Example:** Imagine \"varnished\" means \"painted blue\" and \"plinked\" means \"struck with a hammer\".  \n    *  We know the twonk is painted blue.\n    *  We know IF it was hammered, THEN it's painted blue.\n    *  Can we be sure it was hammered? No. Maybe it was painted blue for another reason.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
