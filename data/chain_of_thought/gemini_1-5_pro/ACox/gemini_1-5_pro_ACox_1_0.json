However, just because we know \"zargled\" happened doesn't automatically mean \"blimmed\" happened. There could be other ways for the flugel to be zargled. \n\n* **Example:** Imagine \"zargled\" means \"wet\".  \n    * Fact 1: The flugel is wet.\n    * Fact 2: If it rained, then the flugel is wet. \n    * Can we conclude it rained? No, maybe someone sprayed it with a hose.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
