There are other possibilities.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"Either the flug is blummed or it must be zimmed\"**\n   This gives us two options for the flug: blummed or zimmed.\n\nNow let's combine the information:\n\n* We know the flug doesn't *have* to be zimmed (from Statement 1).\n* We know it must be either blummed or zimmed (from Statement 2).\n\nSince the flug doesn't have to be zimmed, and the only other option is that it's blummed, we can conclude that the flug must be blummed.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
