There's no obligation for it to be garpled.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"Either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled\"**\n   This gives us two possibilities:\n      * The wug is sproinged.\n      * The wug must be garpled.\n\n* **Putting them together:** Statement 1 tells us the wug doesn't *have* to be garpled.  Statement 2 tells us if it's NOT garpled, then it MUST be sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
