There's no obligation to plink it.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"Either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked\"**\n   This presents two possibilities:\n      * The twonk is varnished.\n      * The twonk must be plinked.\n\n* **Our goal: Can we infer \"The twonk is varnished\"?**\n\nNow let's combine the information:\n\n* Statement 1 tells us the twonk doesn't *have* to be plinked. \n* Statement 2 tells us if it's *not* plinked, then it *must* be varnished.\n\nSince we've established that plinking isn't mandatory, the second part of Statement 2 comes into play.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
