It could be optional, or not needed at all.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"Either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled\"** - This presents two possibilities: either the flugel is blimmed, or it must be zargled.\n\nNow let's consider how these statements interact:\n\n* Statement 1 tells us zargling is NOT mandatory.\n* Statement 2 says zargling is ONE possibility.\n* Since zargling isn't mandatory (from statement 1), and statement 2 offers it as only one possibility, the other possibility (the flugel being blimmed) must be true. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
