We don't know for sure.\n\n* **Premise 2:** Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked.\n    * This gives us two possibilities: \n        * **Possibility A:** The splat is morphed.\n        * **Possibility B:** The splat must be quanked.\n\n* **The Question:** Can we be certain that \"The splat is morphed\"?\n\nNow let's consider if the premises force us into only one possibility:\n\n* Premise 1 tells us the splat doesn't *have* to be quanked. \n* This means Possibility B in Premise 2 isn't the only option. \n* Since Possibility A (the splat is morphed) is still a valid option, we can't definitively say the splat *must* be morphed.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
