This means the dreb might be spened, or it might not be. \n* **Premise 2:** Either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened. This gives us two possibilities.\n    * **Possibility 1:** The dreb is vroombed.\n    * **Possibility 2:** The dreb must be spened. \n* **The Question:** Can we be certain that \"The dreb is vroombed\"?\n\nNow let's analyze:\n\n* Premise 1 tells us that the dreb doesn't *have* to be spened. \n* Premise 2 tells us that IF the dreb isn't spened, THEN it must be vroombed.\n\nHowever, Premise 1 doesn't rule out the possibility that the dreb *could* still be spened. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
