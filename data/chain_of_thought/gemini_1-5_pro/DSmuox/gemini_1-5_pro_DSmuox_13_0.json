This scenario fits with both premises.\n* **Scenario B:** If the glip is NOT slogged, then according to Premise 2, it MUST be tragged. However, this contradicts Premise 1, which says the glip doesn't HAVE to be tragged.\n\nSince Scenario B leads to a contradiction, only Scenario A is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
