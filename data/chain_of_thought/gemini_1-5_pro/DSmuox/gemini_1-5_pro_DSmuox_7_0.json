It could be, but it's not required.\n\n* **Premise 2:** \"Either the whiffle is shanked or it must be tinked.\" This gives us two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n\n* **Reasoning:** Since Premise 1 tells us the whiffle doesn't *have* to be tinked, and Premise 2 says it must be either tinked OR shanked, the only remaining possibility is that the whiffle is shanked.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
