It's not required.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled.\" This gives us two possibilities:\n    * **Possibility 1:** The sprocket is cranked.\n    * **Possibility 2:** The sprocket must be daggled.\n\n* **Our Goal:**  Determine if we can definitively say \"The sprocket is cranked.\"\n\nNow let's analyze:\n\n* Statement 1 tells us the sprocket doesn't *have* to be daggled. \n* Statement 2 tells us if it's NOT daggled, it MUST be cranked.\n\nSince we don't know for sure if the sprocket is daggled or not, we have to consider both possibilities from Statement 2.  \n\n**Therefore, we cannot definitively say the sprocket is cranked.**\n\nAnswer: no \n"
