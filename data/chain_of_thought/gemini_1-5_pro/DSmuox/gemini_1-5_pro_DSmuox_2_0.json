There might be other possibilities.\n\n* **\"Either the wug is flooped or it must be bimmed\"**: This presents two options for the wug, and at least one of them must be true.\n\nNow, since we know the wug doesn't *have* to be bimmed (from the first statement), the second statement can still hold true if the wug is flooped. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
