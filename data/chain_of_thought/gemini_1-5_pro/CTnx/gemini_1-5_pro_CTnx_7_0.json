The contrapositive of a statement is formed by switching the hypothesis and conclusion, and negating both. \n\n* **Contrapositive of the original:** If the whiffle did tink (negation of \"did not tink\"), then the whiffle was not shanked (negation of \"was shanked\").\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
