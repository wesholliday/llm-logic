The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nIn our case:\n\n* **Original:** If the wug was flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint.\n* **Contrapositive:** If the wug bimmed the zoint (not did not bim), then the wug was not flooped.\n\n**Importantly, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.**  If one is true, the other must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
