It doesn't directly tell us what happens if the shank is nugged.  \n\nConsider this: What if a shank could be BOTH nugged and not plooked? The original statement doesn't rule that out. It only tells us that being plooked rules out being nugged.\n\nTherefore, we can't definitively say that if the shank was nugged, then it was not plooked.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
