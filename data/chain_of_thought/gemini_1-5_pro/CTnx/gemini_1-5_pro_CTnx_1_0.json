This sets up a conditional relationship where being \"blimmed\" implies not being \"zargled.\"\n\n* **Question:** Can we infer \"If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed?\" This is asking if the relationship works in reverse.\n\n* **Reasoning:**  In logic, reversing a conditional statement doesn't always hold true.  Just because \"blimmed\" means \"not zargled\" doesn't automatically mean \"zargled\" means \"not blimmed.\" There could be other reasons why a flugel might not be blimmed.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
