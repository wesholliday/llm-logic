            "content": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled. This is a conditional statement, often written as \"If P, then Q\" where:\n    * P: The sprocket was cranked.\n    * Q: The sprocket was not daggled.\n\n* **Inference we're checking:** If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked. This is also a conditional statement:\n    * P: The sprocket was daggled.\n    * Q: The sprocket was not cranked.\n\n* **Logical relationship:** The inference is the *contrapositive* of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n* **Validity of contrapositives:**  In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true. \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
