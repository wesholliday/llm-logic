            "content": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk did not plagged. This sets up a conditional relationship where \"vreebled\" being true means \"plagged\" cannot be true.\n\n* **Inference to test:** If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled. This is essentially flipping the original statement and negating both parts.\n\n* **Logical equivalence:**  In logic, flipping a conditional statement and negating both parts is called taking the contrapositive. The important thing is that the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. If one is true, the other must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
