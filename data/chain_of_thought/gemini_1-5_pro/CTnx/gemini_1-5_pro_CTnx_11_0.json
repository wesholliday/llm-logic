            "content": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the flug was blummed, then the flug was not zimmed. This is a classic \"If P, then Q\" statement, where:\n    * P = the flug was blummed\n    * Q = the flug was not zimmed\n\n* **What we want to infer:** If the flug was zimmed, then the flug was not blummed.  This switches the order and negates both parts:\n    * Not Q = the flug was blummed \n    * Not P = the flug was not zimmed\n\n* **Logical connection:** The original statement tells us that if P happens, Q cannot happen.  The question is, does that mean if Q *doesn't* happen, then P *must* have happened?\n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine the flug could be in a third state, neither blummed nor zimmed.  In that case, the original statement would still be true (if blummed, then not zimmed), but our desired inference would be false (just because it's not zimmed doesn't mean it *must* be blummed).\n\nAnswer: no \n"
