The contrapositive is formed by:\n    * Switching the order of the two parts of the statement.\n    * Negating both parts of the statement.\n\n* **Apply this to our example:**\n    * Original: If S was C, then S did not F.\n    * Contrapositive: If S did F, then S was not C.\n\n* **The contrapositive is exactly what we were asked to infer.**\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
