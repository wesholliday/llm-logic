In our case, this would be \"If the glip was tragged (not not tragged), then the glip was not slogged.\"\n\n**Key Logic Principle:**  A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true. \n\n**Applying the Principle:** Since the original statement is given as true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
