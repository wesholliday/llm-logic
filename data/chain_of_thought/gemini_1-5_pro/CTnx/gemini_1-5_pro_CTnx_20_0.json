This is a classic \"If P, then Q\" statement.\n* **We want to know if we can infer:** If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered. This is essentially the contrapositive: \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.  If the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\n**Therefore:**\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
