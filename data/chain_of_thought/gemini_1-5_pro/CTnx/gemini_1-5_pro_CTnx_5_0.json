In our case, this would be \"If the zinger was smoogled (not Q), then the zinger was not fraggled (not P).\"\n\n**Key Logic Principle:**  A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true. \n\n**Therefore:**\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
