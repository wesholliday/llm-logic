            "content": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the wug was sproinged, then it was not garpled. This sets up a conditional relationship where sproinged being true means garpled must be false.\n\n* **Inference to test:** If the wug was garpled, then the wug was not sproinged. This is essentially flipping the original statement and seeing if it holds true.\n\n* **Reasoning:**  The original statement tells us sproinged and garpled cannot exist together. If something is sproinged, it cannot be garpled.  Therefore, if something IS garpled, it cannot be sproinged. The inference logically follows.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
