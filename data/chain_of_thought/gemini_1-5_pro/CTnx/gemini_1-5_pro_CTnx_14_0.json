The contrapositive of a statement is formed by switching the hypothesis and conclusion, and negating both.  \n\n* **Contrapositive of the original:** If the clug snugged (negation of \"did not snugged\"), then the clug was not fleeked (negation of \"was fleeked\").\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
