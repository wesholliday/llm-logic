The contrapositive of a statement is formed by switching the hypothesis and conclusion, and negating both. \n\n* **Contrapositive of the original:** If the splat did quank (negation of \"did not quank\"), then the splat was not morphed (negation of \"was morphed\").\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
