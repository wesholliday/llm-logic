The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\".\n\n* **Let's apply this to our problem:**\n    * Original statement: If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was not spened.\n    * Potential contrapositive: If the dreb was spened (not not spened), then the dreb was not vroombed.\n\n* **The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.**\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
