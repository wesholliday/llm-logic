This means it's possible the banana wasn't yellow, but it doesn't guarantee it.\n* **Premise 2:** If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. This is a conditional statement, where a red apple guarantees a yellow banana.\n\nNow let's consider the conclusion:\n\n* **Conclusion:** The apple was not red.\n\nIf the conclusion were true, it would mean the condition in Premise 2 (red apple) is false.  When the condition of a conditional statement is false, the statement itself is considered true regardless of the outcome.  \n\nSince Premise 2 could still be true even if the apple wasn't red, we haven't definitively proven the conclusion.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
