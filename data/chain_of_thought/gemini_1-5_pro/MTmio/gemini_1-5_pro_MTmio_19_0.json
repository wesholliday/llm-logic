This means it's possible Jen didn't watch basketball, but it doesn't confirm it. \n\n* **Statement 2:** If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. This is a conditional statement, where Tom watching football is the condition for Jen watching basketball.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer \"Tom did not watch football\"?\n\n* If Tom DID watch football, then according to Statement 2, Jen MUST have watched basketball. \n* However, Statement 1 tells us it's possible Jen did NOT watch basketball.\n* This creates a contradiction if we assume Tom watched football. \n\nTherefore...\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
