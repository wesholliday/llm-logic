            "content": "Let's break this down:\n\n* **Statement 1:** The book might not be a mystery novel.  This means it's possible the book is NOT a mystery, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that it IS a mystery.\n\n* **Statement 2:** If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel. This is a conditional statement, setting up a rule: IF James wrote it, THEN it's a mystery.\n\n* **Question:** Can we infer \"The book was not written by James\"?\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nWe need to see if the statements force us to conclude James didn't write the book.  \n\n* If the book IS a mystery, Statement 2 tells us nothing definitive. James *could* have written it, but someone else could have too.\n* If the book is NOT a mystery, Statement 2 tells us James COULDN'T have written it.  The rule is broken.\n\nSince the first statement leaves open the possibility of the book NOT being a mystery, we can't rule out that James didn't write it.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
