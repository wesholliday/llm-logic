This means it's possible Amy didn't play tennis, but it's not certain.\n* **Statement 2:** If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. This is a conditional statement, where Jeff playing basketball guarantees Amy played tennis.\n\n**2.  Consider the possibilities:**\n\n* **Possibility 1: Jeff played basketball.** If this is true, then according to Statement 2, Amy MUST have played tennis.  This contradicts Statement 1, which allows for the possibility of Amy NOT playing. Therefore, this possibility is unlikely.\n* **Possibility 2: Jeff did not play basketball.**  If this is true, it doesn't contradict either statement. Statement 2 only applies IF Jeff played basketball. \n\n**3. Determine the inference:**\n\nSince Possibility 2 aligns with both statements without contradiction, it's a reasonable inference.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
