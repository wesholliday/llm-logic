This means it's possible Bob didn't choose pasta, but doesn't guarantee it.\n* **Statement 2:** If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. This is a conditional statement, where Sue choosing pizza is the condition for Bob choosing pasta.\n\nNow, we want to see if we can conclude \"Sue did not choose pizza\". \n\nLet's consider the possibility that Sue *did* choose pizza. If so, Statement 2 tells us Bob *must* have chosen pasta. However, Statement 1 says Bob *might not* have chosen pasta. This creates a contradiction.\n\nTo avoid the contradiction, the only possibility left is that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
