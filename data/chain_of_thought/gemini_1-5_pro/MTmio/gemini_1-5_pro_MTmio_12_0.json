This means it's possible Lucy didn't go to the zoo.\n* **Statement 2:** If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This is a conditional statement. \n* **Goal:** We want to see if we can conclude \"Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nIf Joe DID go to the park, then according to Statement 2, Lucy MUST have gone to the zoo.  But Statement 1 says it's possible Lucy DIDN'T go to the zoo.  This creates a contradiction. The only way to resolve this is if our initial assumption (that Joe went to the park) is wrong.\n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
