            "content": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n* **Premise 1:** The muffins might not have been blueberry. This means it's possible they were blueberry, but it's also possible they were a different flavor.\n* **Premise 2:** If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry. This is a conditional statement, where \"the cake was chocolate\" is the antecedent and \"the muffins must have been blueberry\" is the consequent.\n* **Conclusion:** The cake was not chocolate. We need to see if this conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nIf the cake *were* chocolate, then according to Premise 2, the muffins *must* have been blueberry. However, Premise 1 tells us the muffins *might not* have been blueberry. This creates a contradiction.  The only way to resolve this contradiction is if the initial assumption (that the cake was chocolate) is false.\n\n**Answer: Yes** \n"
