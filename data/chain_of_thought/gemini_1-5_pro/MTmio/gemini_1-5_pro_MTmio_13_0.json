This means the truck could have been any color, including blue.\n* **Premise 2:** If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. This is a conditional statement.\n* **Conclusion:** The car was not red.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nTo see if the conclusion follows, let's consider what happens if the car *was* red. If the car was red, then according to Premise 2, the truck *must* have been blue. However, Premise 1 tells us the truck might *not* have been blue. This creates a contradiction. \n\nSince assuming the car was red leads to a contradiction with our premises, the car cannot be red.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
