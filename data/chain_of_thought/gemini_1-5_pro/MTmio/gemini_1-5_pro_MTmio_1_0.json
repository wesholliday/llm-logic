This means it's possible Sue wasn't there, but doesn't guarantee it.\n* **Statement 2:** If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This is a conditional statement, where Mary being at the wedding guarantees Sue being there.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can conclude \"Mary was not at the wedding\". \n\nIf Mary *was* at the wedding, Statement 2 tells us Sue must have been there too. This contradicts the possibility presented in Statement 1 that Sue might *not* have been there. \n\nTo avoid a contradiction, we must conclude that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
