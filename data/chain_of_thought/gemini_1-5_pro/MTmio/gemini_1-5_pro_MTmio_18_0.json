This means there's a possibility the truck was made of something else.\n* **Premise 2:** If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. This sets up a conditional relationship.\n* **Conclusion:** The doll was not plastic. \n\nNow let's see if the conclusion follows:\n\n* If the truck wasn't metal (Premise 1 is possible), then Premise 2 tells us the doll couldn't have been plastic. \n* Therefore, the conclusion is supported by the premises.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
