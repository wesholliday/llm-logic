            "content": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n* **Statement 1:** The pants might not have been denim. This means there's a possibility the pants were not denim, but it doesn't confirm it. \n\n* **Statement 2:** If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. This is a conditional statement, setting up a rule where cotton shirts mean denim pants.\n\n* **Question:** Can we infer \"The shirt was not cotton\"?\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nIf the shirt *were* cotton, statement 2 would force the pants to be denim. But statement 1 says the pants *might not* have been denim.  This creates a contradiction.  The only way to resolve this is if our initial assumption (that the shirt was cotton) is wrong.\n\n**Answer: Yes** \n"
