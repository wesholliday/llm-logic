This means it's possible Chris didn't finish, but it's also possible he did.\n* **Premise 2:** If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race. This is a conditional statement, where Alex finishing is the condition for Chris finishing.\n* **Conclusion:** Alex did not finish the race. We need to see if this logically follows from the premises.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nIf Alex *did* finish the race, then according to Premise 2, Chris *must* have finished.  This contradicts the possibility presented in Premise 1 that Chris might *not* have finished.  Therefore, to avoid a contradiction, Alex could not have finished the race.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
