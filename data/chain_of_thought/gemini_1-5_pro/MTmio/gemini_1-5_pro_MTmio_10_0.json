This means there's a possibility the cat was inside.\n* **Statement 2:** If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside. This tells us the dog being inside directly leads to the cat being outside.\n\nNow let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The dog was not inside\"?\n\n* **Reasoning:** If the dog *were* inside, then according to Statement 2, the cat would have to be outside. However, Statement 1 leaves open the possibility that the cat was *not* outside. This creates a contradiction if we assume the dog was inside. \n\n* **Conclusion:** To avoid the contradiction, the dog must not have been inside.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
