This means there's a possibility Kate didn't eat salad, but it's not certain.\n* **Statement 2:** If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad. This is a conditional statement, where Ben eating pasta is the condition, and Kate eating salad is the result.\n\nNow let's consider the question: Can we infer \"Ben did not eat pasta\"?\n\n* **Reasoning:** If Ben DID eat pasta, then according to Statement 2, Kate MUST have eaten salad. However, Statement 1 tells us it's possible Kate did NOT eat salad. This creates a contradiction. The only way to resolve this is if our initial assumption (that Ben ate pasta) is false.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
