This means it's possible the wolf was NOT in the den.\n* **Statement 2:** If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den. This is a conditional statement, where the bear being in the cave is the condition for the wolf being in the den.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"The bear was not in the cave\".  \n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n* **Possibility 1: The bear WAS in the cave.** According to Statement 2, this would mean the wolf MUST have been in the den. However, Statement 1 says the wolf might NOT have been in the den. This creates a contradiction.\n* **Possibility 2: The bear was NOT in the cave.** This scenario doesn't contradict either statement. Statement 2 only applies if the bear WAS in the cave.\n\nSince Possibility 1 leads to a contradiction, we can eliminate it. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
