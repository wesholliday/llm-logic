            "content": "Let's break this down:\n\n* **Statement 1:** Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. This means it's possible Mark didn't buy the blue shirt, but it doesn't tell us for sure.\n* **Statement 2:** If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This is a conditional statement, where Lisa buying the red shirt is the condition for Mark buying the blue shirt.\n\nNow, we want to see if we can conclude \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n* **Possibility 1: Lisa bought the red shirt.**  If this is true, then according to Statement 2, Mark MUST have bought the blue shirt.  This contradicts Statement 1, which says Mark might NOT have bought the blue shirt. So, this possibility isn't logically sound.\n* **Possibility 2: Lisa did not buy the red shirt.** This possibility doesn't contradict either of our given statements. It leaves the status of Mark's shirt purchase open, which is allowed by Statement 1.\n\nSince Possibility 1 leads to a contradiction, the only logically sound option is Possibility 2.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
