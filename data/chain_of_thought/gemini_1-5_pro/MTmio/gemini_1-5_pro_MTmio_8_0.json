This means there's a possibility the mummy was asleep, but it's not certain.\n* **Statement 2:** If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake. This tells us the vampire being awake guarantees the mummy was also awake.\n\nNow let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The vampire was not awake\"?\n\n* **Reasoning:** If the vampire WAS awake, statement 2 tells us the mummy MUST have been awake too. However, statement 1 leaves open the possibility that the mummy was NOT awake. \n* **Conclusion:**  Since the mummy might have been asleep (statement 1), the vampire couldn't have been awake (because of statement 2).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
