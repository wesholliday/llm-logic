This means it's possible the unicorn was absent, but doesn't confirm it.\n* **Statement 2:** If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest. This is a conditional statement, setting up a rule.\n\nNow let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The griffin was not in the forest\"?\n\nReasoning:\n\n* If the griffin WAS in the forest, Statement 2 tells us the unicorn MUST have been there too.\n* However, Statement 1 says the unicorn MIGHT NOT have been there. \n* This creates a contradiction if we assume the griffin was present. \n\nTherefore...\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
