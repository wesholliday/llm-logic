This means it's possible Erin didn't take a train, but doesn't guarantee it.\n* **Premise 2:** If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. This is a conditional statement, where Sam taking a plane would force Erin to have taken a train.\n\nNow let's consider if Sam DID take a plane:\n\n* If Sam took a plane, Premise 2 would mean Erin MUST have taken a train. \n* However, Premise 1 says Erin might NOT have taken a train. \n* This creates a contradiction. \n\nTo avoid the contradiction, the only option is that our initial assumption (Sam taking a plane) must be false.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
