            "content": "Let's break down this argument:\n\n* **Premise:** If directions were provided, then they were not explained clearly. This is a conditional statement, often written as \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"directions were provided\" and Q is \"they were not explained clearly.\"\n\n* **Conclusion:** If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided. This is also a conditional statement: \"If Q', then P'\" where Q' is \"directions were explained clearly\" and P' is \"directions were not provided.\"\n\nNotice that the conclusion looks a lot like the premise with the \"if\" and \"then\" parts flipped and the statements negated.  This structure is called the *contrapositive* in logic.\n\nHere's the key point: **A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.** This means if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nSince the argument's conclusion is simply the contrapositive of the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
