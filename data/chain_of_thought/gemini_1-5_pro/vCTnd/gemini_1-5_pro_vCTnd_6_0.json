This statement sets up a conditional relationship where washing the clothes implies they weren't washed properly. \n* **Conclusion:** If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed. This statement also sets up a conditional relationship, but it reverses the premise.\n\nTo determine validity, we need to see if the conclusion *must* be true IF the premise is true.  \n\nConsider this: Could the clothes be unwashed while the premise remains true? Yes. The premise only talks about what happens *if* they are washed. It doesn't prevent them from being unwashed in the first place.\n\nSince the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premise, the argument is not logically valid.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
