This statement sets up a conditional relationship where preparing the meal implies it wasn't done carefully.\n* **Conclusion:** If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared. This statement flips the conditional relationship from the premise. It says if the meal WAS prepared carefully, then it WASN'T prepared at all.\n\nNow, let's consider if the conclusion logically follows from the premise.  The premise doesn't say anything about what happens if the meal IS prepared carefully. It only tells us about the situation where the meal IS prepared.  Therefore, we can't logically conclude that a carefully prepared meal means it wasn't prepared at all.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
