This sets up a conditional statement where completion implies a lack of quality.\n* **Conclusion:** If the job was completed well, then it was not completed. This also sets up a conditional statement, but reverses the relationship, stating quality implies a lack of completion.\n\nTo determine validity, we need to see if the conclusion MUST be true IF the premise is true.  \n\nConsider this: Could the job be BOTH completed AND completed well? If so, the premise is immediately false. A false premise doesn't automatically make a conclusion false, it just means we can't determine the conclusion's truth based on the premise alone.\n\nSince the premise doesn't hold up in all scenarios, the argument's form isn't forcing the conclusion to be true.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
