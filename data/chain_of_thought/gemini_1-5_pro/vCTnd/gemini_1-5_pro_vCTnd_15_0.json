This statement sets up a conditional relationship where tidying implies a lack of thoroughness.\n* **Conclusion:** If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied. This statement also presents a conditional relationship, but it reverses the elements from the premise.\n\nTo determine validity, we need to see if the conclusion ALWAYS holds true IF the premise is true.  \n\nConsider this: Could the room have NOT been tidied at all? If so, the premise still holds true (since it only speaks about what happens IF the room WAS tidied). But in this scenario, the conclusion would be false.\n\nSince we found a scenario where the premise could be true while the conclusion is false, the argument's form is not logically valid.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
