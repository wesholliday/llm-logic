We can symbolize this as:  If R, then not S.\n* **Conclusion:** If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made. We can symbolize this as: If S, then not R.\n\nNotice that the conclusion is just the contrapositive of the premise.  In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is formed by switching the hypothesis and conclusion and negating both.  \n\nA statement and its contrapositive are always logically equivalent. This means if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
