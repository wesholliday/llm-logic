This sets up a conditional relationship where studying implies not studying diligently.\n* **Conclusion:** If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study. This also sets up a conditional relationship, but reverses the terms from the premise.\n\nTo determine validity, we need to see if the conclusion *must* be true IF the premise is true.  \n\nConsider this: Could Ben have studied without studying diligently? Yes, it's possible.  The premise doesn't exclude that. \n\nIf Ben did study, but not diligently, the premise holds true. However, in this scenario, the conclusion would be false because Ben DID study.\n\nSince we found a scenario where the premise is true but the conclusion could be false, the argument is not logically valid.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
