This doesn't rule out the possibility of her exercising lightly.\n\n2. **Consider the conclusion:** It flips the premise and states that if Ann exercised strenuously, she didn't exercise at all. This contradicts the premise, which allows for non-strenuous exercise.\n\n3. **Logical Validity:** An argument is logically valid if the conclusion must be true whenever the premise is true. In this case, the conclusion can be false even if the premise is true. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
