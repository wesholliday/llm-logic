This is because the statements are contrapositives of each other. \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement is formed by switching the hypothesis and conclusion, and then negating both. If the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also always true.\n\nSince the premise and conclusion are logically equivalent, the argument is valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
