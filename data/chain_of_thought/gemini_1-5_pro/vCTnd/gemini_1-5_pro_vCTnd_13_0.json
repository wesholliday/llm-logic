This implies that there's no scenario where Alex both exercised AND exercised a lot. \n* **Conclusion:** If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise. This flips the premise around but essentially says the same thing \u2013 if Alex exercised a lot, he couldn't have exercised (in a general sense).\n\nSince the premise and conclusion are logically equivalent (just phrased differently), the argument is valid. A valid argument means the conclusion must be true if the premise is true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
