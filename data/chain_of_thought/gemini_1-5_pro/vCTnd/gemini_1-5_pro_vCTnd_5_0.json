            "content": "Let's break down the argument:\n\n* **Premise:** If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly. This statement sets up a conditional relationship: cleaning implies a lack of thoroughness.\n* **Conclusion:** If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned. This statement also sets up a conditional relationship: thorough cleaning implies no cleaning at all.\n\nNow let's analyze the logic:\n\nThe argument is trying to use the premise to prove the conclusion.  However, the premise only talks about what happens when the room is \"cleaned\". It doesn't directly address the scenario where the room is \"cleaned thoroughly\". \n\nCould a room be both \"cleaned\" and \"cleaned thoroughly\"?  If so, the premise wouldn't apply to that situation, and we couldn't use it to draw a conclusion about \"cleaned thoroughly\".\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically sound because the premise doesn't provide enough information to definitively conclude that \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned.\"\n\nAnswer: no \n"
