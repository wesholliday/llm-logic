This sets up a conditional statement where being served implies not being served promptly.\n* **Conclusion:** If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served. This also sets up a conditional statement, reversing the premise's conditions.\n\nTo determine validity, we need to see if the conclusion *must* be true IF the premise is true.  \n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n* **If the premise is true, could the conclusion be false?**  Yes. The premise only tells us what happens if the customer IS served. It doesn't say anything about what happens if they are served promptly. It's possible to be served promptly and still be served.\n\nSince we found a scenario where the premise could be true and the conclusion false, the argument is not logically valid.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
