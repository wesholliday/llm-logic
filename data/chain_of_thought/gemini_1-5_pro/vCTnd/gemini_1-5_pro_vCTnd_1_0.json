This implies there are two possible situations: 1) It's raining lightly, or 2) It's not raining at all.\n* **Conclusion:** If it's raining hard, then it's not raining. This contradicts the premise, as the premise allows for the possibility of light rain.\n\nTo be logically valid, the conclusion must always be true if the premise is true. Since the conclusion contradicts a possible scenario allowed by the premise, the argument is not logically valid.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
