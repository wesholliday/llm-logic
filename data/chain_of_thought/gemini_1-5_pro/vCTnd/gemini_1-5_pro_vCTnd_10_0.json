There's no room for helpful advice to have been given in this scenario.\n\n**Conclusion:** If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered.\n\n* This conclusion tries to flip the premise around. It's saying that IF helpful advice was given, THEN advice wasn't given at all. \n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe conclusion contradicts the premise. The premise establishes that any advice offered is unhelpful.  The conclusion tries to say that if helpful advice WAS offered, then no advice was offered at all. This doesn't logically follow.  The premise already dictates that any offered advice is unhelpful.\n\n**Answer: No** \n"
