This sets up a conditional relationship where studying implies not studying long.\n* **Conclusion:** If Jane studied long, then she did not study. This also sets up a conditional relationship, but reverses the premise.\n\nTo determine validity, we need to see if the conclusion MUST be true IF the premise is true.  \n\nLet's consider a scenario where the premise holds: Imagine Jane studied for a very short time. This would make the premise true (she studied, but not for long). \n\nNow, does this scenario force the conclusion to be true?  Could Jane have studied long in this scenario? No. \n\nSince the premise being true forces the conclusion to also be true, the argument is valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
